First Folio of Shakespeare : machine readable text format
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This file contains embedded markers for use by Oxford Concordance Program,
delimited by the characaters < and >
 
The following categories of reference are included:
 
    T  : Play title
    C  : Compositor identifier
    P  : Signature
    A  : authorial attribution
    Y  : (occasionally) type of copy
 
    S  : Speaker prefix
    Z  : Act/scene prefix stage direction etc
    D  : embedded stage direction
 
Lines begining with either a space or a star are text lines, one for each
line in the original text. Lines begining within a * are justified lines.
Hinman's lineation for the folio is followed. Lines begining with a reference
(i.e. <) are not included in the lineation.
 
The character # is used in some texts to distinguish homographs (e.g. Will and
Will); it is also used with the hyphen to indicate cases where hyphenation
is significant.
 
The characters { and } (curly braces) are used to enclose material in italics
     Words containing tildes in the original texts have been expanded.
     Words hyphenated across a line boundary have be joined together and
     included at the end of the first line.  A "%" marks the hyphen in this
     case. If the second part of the hyphenated word was the only thing
     on that line, an underscore "_" on that line is used to indicate that
     it is a non-blank line in the original text.
 Turnovers are joined together on the     first line, and the character "|" is used to mark this point.
