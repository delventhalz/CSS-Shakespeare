2      <D {#Valentine}: {Protheus}, and {Speed}.>
3      <S {Valentine}.>
4      Cease to perswade, my louing {Protheus};
5     *Home- keeping youth, haue euer homely wits,
6      #Wer't not affection chaines thy tender dayes
7      To the sweet glaunces of thy honour'd Loue,
8      I rather would entreat thy company,
9      To see the wonders of the world abroad,
10     Then (liuing dully sluggardiz'd at home)
11     Weare out thy youth with shapelesse idlenesse.
12     But since thou lou'st; loue still, and thriue therein,
13     Euen as I would, when I to loue begin.
14     <S {Pro}.> Wilt thou be gone? Sweet {Valentine} adew,
15     Thinke on thy {Protheus}, when thou (hap'ly) seest
16     Some rare note- worthy obiect in thy trauaile.
17     Wish me partaker in thy happinesse,
18     When thou do'st meet good hap; and in thy danger,
19     (If euer danger doe enuiron thee)
20     Commend thy grieuance to my holy prayers,
21     For I will be thy beades- man, {Valentine}.
22     <S {Val}.> And on a loue- booke pray for my successe?
23     <S {Pro}.> Vpon some booke I loue, I'le pray for thee.
24     <S {Val}.> That's on some shallow Storie of deepe loue,
25     How yong {Leander} crost the {Hellespont}.
26     <S {Pro}.> That's a deepe Storie, of a deeper loue,
27     For he was more then ouer- shooes in loue.
28     <S {Val}.> 'Tis true; for you are ouer- bootes in loue,
29     And yet you neuer swom the {Hellespont}.
30     <S {Pro}.> Ouer the Bootes? nay giue me not the Boots.
31     <S {Val}.> No, I will not; for it boots thee not.
32     <S {Pro}.> What?
33    *<S {Val}.> To be in loue; where scorne is bought with |(grones:
34    *Coy looks, with hart- sore sighes: one fading moments |(mirth,
35     With twenty watchfull, weary, tedious nights;
36     If hap'ly won, perhaps a haplesse gaine;
37     If lost, why then a grieuous labour won;
38     How euer: but a folly bought with wit,
39     Or else a wit, by folly vanquished.
40     <S {Pro}.> So, by your circumstance, you call me foole.
41     <S {Val}.> So, by your circumstance, I feare you'll proue.
42     <S {Pro}.> 'Tis Loue you cauill at, I am not Loue.
43     <S {Val}.> Loue is your master, for he masters you;
44     And he that is so yoked by a foole,
45     Me thinkes should not be chronicled for wise.
46     <S {Pro}.> Yet Writers say; as in the sweetest Bud,
47     The eating Canker dwels; so eating Loue
48     Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
49     <S {Val}.> And Writers say; as the most forward Bud
50     Is eaten by the Canker ere it blow,
51     Euen so by Loue, the yong, and tender wit
52     Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the Bud,
53     Loosing his verdure, euen in the prime,
54     And all the faire effects of future hopes.
55     But wherefore waste I time to counsaile thee
56     That art a votary to fond desire?
57     Once more adieu: my Father at the Road
58     Expects my comming, there to see me ship'd.
59     <S {Pro}.> And thither will I bring thee {Valentine}.
60    *<S {Val}.> Sweet {Protheus}, no: Now let vs take our leaue:
61     To {Millaine} let me heare from thee by Letters
62     Of thy successe in loue; and what newes else
63     Betideth here in absence of thy Friend:
64     And I likewise will visite thee with mine.
65     <S {Pro}.> All happinesse bechance to thee in {Millaine}.
66     <S {Val}.> As much to you at home: and so farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
67     <S {Pro}.> He after Honour hunts, I after Loue;
68     He leaues his friends, to dignifie them more;
69     I loue my selfe, my friends, and all for loue:
70     Thou {Iulia}, thou hast metamorphis'd me:
71     Made me neglect my Studies, loose my time;
72     Warre with good counsaile; set the world at nought;
73    *Made Wit with musing, weake; hart sick with thought.
74     <S {Sp}.> Sir {Protheus:} 'saue you: saw you my Master?
75    *<S {Pro}.> But now he parted hence to embarque for {Millain}.
76     <S {Sp}.> Twenty to one then, he is ship'd already,
77     And I haue plaid the Sheepe in loosing him.
78     <S {Pro}.> Indeede a Sheepe doth very often stray,
79     #And if the Shepheard be awhile away.
80    *<S {Sp}.> You conclude that my Master is a Shepheard then,
81     and I Sheepe?
82     <S {Pro}.> I doe.
83    *<S {Sp}.> Why then my hornes are his hornes, whether I
84     wake or sleepe.
85     <S {Pro}.> A silly answere, and fitting well a Sheepe.
86     <S {Sp}.> This proues me still a Sheepe.
87     <S {Pro}.> True: and thy Master a Shepheard.
88     <S {Sp}.> Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
89     <S {Pro}.> It shall goe hard but ile proue it by another.
90    *<S {Sp}.> The Shepheard seekes the Sheepe, and not the
91    *Sheepe the Shepheard; but I seeke my Master, and my
92     Master seekes not me: therefore I am no Sheepe.
93    *<S {Pro}.> The Sheepe for fodder follow the Shepheard,
94    *the Shepheard for foode followes not the Sheepe: thou
95    *for wages followest thy Master, thy Master for wages
96     followes not thee: therefore thou art a Sheepe.
97     <S {Sp}.> Such another proofe will make me cry baa.
98    *<S {Pro}.> But do'st thou heare: gau'st thou my Letter
99     to {Iulia}?
      <P B5>
100   *<S {Sp}.> #I Sir: I (a lost- Mutton) gaue your Letter to her
101   *(a lac'd- Mutton) and she (a lac'd- Mutton) gaue mee (a
102    lost- Mutton) nothing for my labour.
103   *<S {Pro}.> Here's too small a Pasture for such store of
104    Muttons.
105   *<S {Sp}.> If the ground be ouer- charg'd, you were best
106    sticke her.
107   *<S {Pro}.> Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound
108    you.
109   *<S {Sp}.> Nay Sir, lesse then a pound shall serue me for car-rying
110    your Letter.
111    <S {Pro}.> You mistake; I meane the pound, a Pinfold.
112    <S {Sp}.> From a pound to a pin? fold it ouer and ouer,
113   *'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your louer
114    <S {Pro}.> But what said she?
115    <S {Sp}.> #I.
116    <S {Pro}.> Nod- I, why that's noddy.
117    <S {Sp}.> You mistooke Sir: I say she did nod;
118    And you aske me if she did nod, and #I say I.
119    <S {Pro}.> And that set together is noddy.
120   *<S {Sp}.> Now you haue taken the paines to set it toge-ther,
121    take it for your paines.
122    <S {Pro}.> No, no, you shall haue it for bearing the letter.
123   *<S {Sp}.> Well, I perceiue I must be faine to beare with you.
124    <S {Pro}.> Why Sir, how doe you beare with me?
125    <S {Sp}.> Marry Sir, the letter very orderly,
126    Hauing nothing but the word noddy for my paines.
127    <S {Pro}.> Beshrew me, but you haue a quicke wit.
128    <S {Sp}.> And yet it cannot ouer- take your slow purse.
129   *<S {Pro}.> Come, come, open the matter in briefe; what
130    said she.
131   *<S {Sp}.> Open your purse, that the money, and the matter
132    may be both at once deliuered.
133   *<S {Pro}.> Well Sir: here is for your paines: what said she?
134    <S {Sp}.> Truely Sir, I thinke you'll hardly win her.
135   *<S {Pro}.> Why? could'st thou perceiue so much from her?
136    <S {Sp}.> Sir, I could perceiue nothing at all from her;
137    No, not so much as a ducket for deliuering your letter:
138    And  being so hard to me, that brought your minde;
139   *I feare she'll proue as hard to you in telling your minde.
140    Giue her no token but stones, for she's as hard as steele.
141    <S {Pro}.> What said she, nothing?
142    <S {Sp}.> No, not so much as take this for thy pains:
143   *To testifie your bounty, I thank you, you haue cestern'd |(me;
144   *In requital whereof, henceforth, carry your letters your
145    selfe; And so Sir, I'le commend you to my Master.
146   *<S {Pro}.> Go, go, be gone, to saue your Ship from wrack,
147    Which cannot perish hauing thee aboarde,
148    Being destin'd to  a drier death on shore:
149    I must goe send some better Messenger,
150    I feare my {Iulia} would not daigne my lines,
151    Receiuing them from such a worthlesse post.  <D {Exit}.>
152    <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
153    <D {Enter Iulia and Lucetta}.>
154    <S {Iul}.> But say {Lucetta} (now we are alone)
155    Would'st thou then counsaile me to fall in loue?
156    <S {Luc}.> #I Madam, so you stumble not vnheedfully.
157    <S {Iul}.> Of all the faire resort of Gentlemen,
158    That euery day with par'le encounter me,
159    In thy opinion which is worthiest loue?
160   *<S {Lu}.> Please you repeat their names, ile shew my minde,
161    According to my shallow simple skill.
162    <S {Iu}.> What thinkst thou of the faire sir {Eglamoure}?
163    <S {Lu}.> As of a Knight, well- spoken, neat, and fine;
164    But were I you, he neuer should be mine.
165    <S {Iu}.> What think'st thou of the rich {Mercatio}?
166    <S {Lu}.> Well of his wealth; but of himselfe, so, so.
167    <S {Iu}.> What think'st thou of the gentle {Protheus}?
168    <S {Lu}.> Lord, Lord: to see what folly raignes in vs.
169   *<S {Iu}.> How now? what meanes this passion at his name?
170    <S {Lu}.> Pardon deare Madam, 'tis a passing shame,
171    That I (vnworthy body as I am)
172    Should censure thus on louely Gentlemen.
173    <S {Iu}.> Why not on {Protheus}, as of all the rest?
174    <S {Lu}.> Then thus: of many good, I thinke him best.
175    <S {Iul}.> Your reason?
176    <S {Lu}.> I haue no other but a womans reason:
177    I thinke him so, because I thinke him so.
178   *<S {Iul}.> And would'st thou haue me cast my loue on him?
179    <S {Lu}.> #I: if you thought your loue not cast away.
180    <S {Iul}.> Why he, of all the rest, hath neuer mou'd me.
181    <S {Lu}.> Yet he, of all the rest, I thinke best loues ye.
182    <S {Iul}.> His little speaking, shewes his loue but small.
183    <S {Lu}.> Fire that's closest kept, burnes most of all.
184   *<S {Iul}.> They doe not loue, that doe not shew their loue.
185   *<S {Lu}.> Oh, they loue least, that let men know their loue.
186    <S {Iul}.> I would I knew his minde.
187    <S {Lu}.> Peruse this paper Madam.
188    <S {Iul}.> To {Iulia}: say, from whom?
189    <S {Lu}.> That the Contents will shew.
190    <S {Iul}.> Say, say: who gaue it thee?
191   *<S {Lu}.> Sir {Valentines} page: & sent I think from {Protheus};
192    He would haue giuen it you, but I being in the way,
193    Did in your name receiue it: pardon the fault I pray.
194    <S {Iul}.> Now (by my modesty) a goodly Broker:
195    Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
196    To whisper, and conspire against my youth?
197    Now trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,
198    And you an officer fit for the place:
199    There: take the paper: see it be return'd,
200    Or else returne no more into my sight.
201    <S {Lu}.> To plead for loue, deserues more fee, then hate.
202    <S {Iul}.> Will ye be gon?
203    <S {Lu}.> That you may ruminate.  <D {Exit}.>
204    <S {Iul}.> And yet I would I had ore- look'd the Letter;
205    It were a shame to call her backe againe,
206    And pray her to a fault, for which I chid her.
207    What 'foole is she, that knowes I am a Maid,
208    And would not force the letter to my view?
209    Since Maides, in modesty, say no, to that,
210    Which they would haue the profferer construe, #I.
211    Fie, fie: how way- ward is this foolish loue;
212    That (like a testie Babe) will scratch the Nurse,
213    And presently, all humbled kisse the Rod?
214    How churlishly, I chid {Lucetta} hence,
215    When willingly, I would haue had her here?
216    How angerly I taught my brow to frowne,
217    When inward ioy enforc'd my heart to smile?
218    My pennance is, to call {Lucetta} backe
219    And aske remission, for my folly past.
220    What hoe: {Lucetta}.
221    <S {Lu}.> What would your Ladiship?
222    <S {Iul}.> Is't neere dinner time?
223    <S {Lu}.> I would it were,
224    That you might kill your stomacke on your meat,
      <P B5v>
225    And not vpon your Maid.
226    <S {Iu}.> What is't that you
227    Tooke vp so gingerly?
228    <S {Lu}.> Nothing.
229    <S {Iu}.> Why didst thou stoope then?
230    <S {Lu}.> To take a paper vp, that I let fall.
231    <S {Iul}.> And is that paper nothing?
232    <S {Lu}.> Nothing concerning me.
233    <S {Iul}.> Then let it lye, for those that it concernes.
234    <S {Lu}.> Madam, it will not lye where it concernes,
235    Vnlesse it haue a false Interpreter.
236    <S {Iul}.> Some loue of yours, hath writ to you in Rime.
237    <S {Lu}.> That I might sing it (Madam) to a tune:
238    Giue me a Note, your Ladiship can set
239    <S {Iul}.> As little by such toyes, as may be possible:
240    Best sing it to the tune of {Light #O, Loue}.
241    <S {Lu}.> It is too heauy for so light a tune.
242    <S {Iu}.> Heauy? belike it hath some burden then?
243    <S {Lu}.> #I: and melodious were it, would you sing it,
244    <S {Iu}.> And why not you?
245    <S {Lu}.> I cannot reach so high.
246    <S {Iu}.> Let's see your Song:
247    How now Minion?
248    <S {Lu}.> Keepe tune there still; so you will sing it out:
249    And yet me thinkes I do not like this tune.
250    <S {Iu}.> You doe not?
251    <S {Lu}.> No (Madam) tis too sharpe.
252    <S {Iu}.> You (Minion) are too saucie.
253    <S {Lu}.> Nay, now you are too flat;
254    And marre the concord, with too harsh a descant:
255    There wanteth but a Meane to fill your Song.
256    <S {Iu}.> The meane is dround with you vnruly base.
257    <S {Lu}.> Indeede I bid the base for {Protheus}.
258    <S {Iu}.> This babble shall not henceforth trouble me;
259    Here is a coile with protestation:
260    Goe, get you gone: and let the papers lye:
261    You would be fingring them, to anger me.
262   *<S {Lu}.> She makes it stra[n]ge, but she would be best pleas'd
263    To be so angred with another Letter.
264    <S {Iu}.> Nay, would I were so angred with the same:
265    Oh hatefull hands, to teare such louing words;
266    Iniurious Waspes, to feede on such sweet hony,
267    And kill the Bees that yeelde it, with your stings;
268    Ile kisse each seuerall paper, for amends:
269    Looke, here is writ, kinde {Iulia}: vnkinde {Iulia},
270    As in reuenge of thy ingratitude,
271    I throw thy name against the bruzing- stones,
272    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdaine.
273    And here is writ, {Loue wounded Protheus}.
274    Poore wounded name: my bosome, as a bed,
275    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
276    And thus I search it with a soueraigne kisse.
277    But twice, or thrice, was {Protheus} written downe:
278    Be calme (good winde) blow not a word away,
279    Till I haue found each letter, in the Letter,
280   *Except mine own name: That, some whirle- winde beare
281    Vnto a ragged, fearefull, hanging Rocke,
282    And throw it thence into the raging Sea.
283    Loe, here in one line is his name twice writ:
284    {Poore forlorne Protheus, passionate Protheus:}
285    {To the sweet Iulia:} that ile teare away:
286    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
287    He couples it, to his complaining Names;
288    Thus will I fold them, one vpon another;
289    Now kisse, embrace, contend, doe what you will.
290   *<S {Lu}.> Madam: dinner is ready: and your father staies.
291    <S {Iu}.> Well, let vs goe.
292   *<S {Lu}.> What, shall these papers lye, like Tel- tales here?
293    <S {Iu}.> If you respect them; best to take them vp.
294    <S {Lu}.> Nay, I was taken vp, for laying them downe.
295    Yet here they shall not lye, for catching cold.
296    <S {Iu}.> I see you haue a months minde to them.
297    <S {Lu}.> #I (Madam) you may say what sights you see;
298    I see things too, although you iudge I winke.
299    <S {Iu}.> Come, come, #wilt please you goe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
300    <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
301    <D {Enter Antonio and Panthino. Protheus}.>
302    <S {Ant}.> Tell me {Panthino}, what sad talke was that,
303    Wherewith my brother held you in the Cloyster?
304    <S {Pan}.> 'Twas of his Nephew {Protheus}, your Sonne.
305    <S {Ant}.> Why? what of him?
306    <S {Pan}.> He wondred that your Lordship
307    Would suffer him, to spend his youth at home,
308    While other men, of slender reputation
309    Put forth their Sonnes, to seeke preferment out.
310    Some to the warres, to try their fortune there;
311    Some, to discouer Islands farre away:
312    Some, to the studious Vniuersities;
313    For any, or for all these exercises,
314    He said, that {Protheus}, your sonne, was meet;
315    And did request me, to importune you
316    To let him spend his time no more at home;
317    Which would be great impeachment to his age,
318    In hauing knowne no trauaile in his youth.
319    <S {Ant}.> Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
320    Whereon, this month I haue bin hamering.
321    I haue consider'd well, his losse of time,
322    And how he cannot be a perfect man,
323    Not being tryed, and tutord in the world:
324    Experience is by industry atchieu'd,
325    And perfected by the swift course of time:
326    Then tell me, whether were I best to send him?
327    <S {Pan}.> I thinke your Lordship is not ignorant
328    How his companion, youthfull {Valentine},
329    Attends the Emperour in his royall Court.
330    <S {Ant}.> I know it well.
331   *<S {Pan}.> 'Twere good, I thinke, your Lordship sent him
332    (thither,
333    There shall he practise Tilts, and Turnaments;
334    Heare sweet discourse, conuerse with Noble- men,
335    And be in eye of euery Exercise
336    Worthy his youth, and noblenesse of birth.
337    <S {Ant}.> I like thy counsaile: well hast thou aduis'd:
338    And that thou maist perceiue how well I like it,
339    The execution of it shall make knowne;
340    Euen with the speediest expedition,
341    I will dispatch him to the Emperors Court.
342    <S {Pan}.> To morrow, may it please you, {#Don Alphonso},
343    With other Gentlemen of good esteeme
344    Are iournying, to salute the {Emperor},
345    And to commend their seruice to his #will.
346   *<S {Ant}.> Good company: with them shall {Protheus} go:
347    And in good time: now will we breake with him.
348    <S {Pro}.> Sweet Loue, sweet lines, sweet life,
349    Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
350    Here is her oath for loue, her honors paune;
      <P B6><C C>
351    O that our Fathers would applaud our loues
352    To seale our happinesse with their consents.
353    <S {Pro}.> Oh heauenly {Iulia}.
354   *<S {Ant}.> How now? What Letter are you reading there?
355   *<S {Pro}.> May't please your Lordship, 'tis a word or two
356    Of commendations sent from {Valentine};
357    Deliuer'd by a friend, that came from him.
358    <S {Ant}.> Lend me the Letter: Let me see what newes.
359   *<S {Pro}.> There is no newes (my Lord) but that he writes
360    How happily he liues, how well- belou'd,
361    And daily graced by the Emperor;
362    Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
363    <S {Ant}.> And how stand you affected to his wish?
364    <S {Pro}.> As one relying on your Lordships #will,
365    And not depending on his friendly wish.
366    <S {Ant}.> My #will is something sorted with his wish:
367    Muse not that I thus sodainly proceed;
368    For what I will, I will, and there an end:
369    I am resolu'd, that thou shalt spend some time
370    With {Valentinus}, in the Emperors Court:
371    What maintenance he from his friends receiues,
372    Like exhibition thou shalt haue from me,
373    To morrow be in readinesse, to goe,
374    Excuse it not: for I am peremptory.
375    <S {Pro}.> My Lord I cannot be so soone prouided,
376    Please you deliberate a day or two.
377   *<S {Ant}.> Look what thou want'st shalbe  sent after thee:
378    No more of stay: to morrow thou must goe;
379    Come on {Panthino}; you shall be imployd,
380    To hasten on his Expedition.
381   *<S {Pro}.> Thus haue I shund the fire, for feare of burning,
382    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
383    I fear'd to shew my Father {Iulias} Letter,
384    Least he should take exceptions to my loue,
385    And with the vantage of mine owne excuse
386    Hath he excepted most against my loue.
387    Oh, how this spring of loue resembleth
388    The vncertaine glory of an Aprill day,
389    Which now shewes all the beauty of the Sun,
390    And #by and by a clowd takes all away.
391    <S {Pan}.> Sir {Protheus}, your Fathers call's for you,
392    He is in #hast, therefore I pray you go.
393    <S {Pro}.> Why this it is: my heart accords thereto,
394    And yet a thousand times it answer's no.
395    <D {Exeunt.  Finis}.>
396    <Z {Actus secundus: Scoena Prima}.>
397    <D {Enter Valentine, Speed, Siluia}.>
398    <S {Speed}.> Sir, your Gloue.
399    <S {Valen}.> Not mine: my Gloues are on.
400   *<S {Sp}.> Why then this may be yours: for this is but one.
401    <S {Val}.> Ha? Let me see: #I, giue it me, it's mine:
402    Sweet Ornament, that deckes a thing diuine,
403    Ah {Siluia}, {Siluia}.
404    <S {Speed}.> Madam {Siluia}: Madam {Siluia}.
405    <S {Val}.> How now Sirha?
406    <S {Speed}.> Shee is not within hearing Sir.
407    <S {Val}.> Why sir, who bad you call her?
408    <S {Speed}.> Your worship sir, or else I mistooke.
409    <S {Val}.> Well: you'll still be too forward.
410   *<S {Speed}.> And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
411   *<S {Val}.> Goe to, sir, tell me: do you know Madam {Siluia}?
412    <S {Speed}.> Shee that your worship loues?
413    <S {Val}.> Why, how know you that I am in loue?
414   *<S {Speed}.> Marry by these speciall markes: first, you haue
415   *learn'd (like Sir {Protheus}) to wreath your Armes like a
416   *Male- content: to rellish a Loue- song, like a {Robin}- red-breast:
417   *to walke alone like one that had the pestilence:
418   *to sigh, like a Schoole- boy that had lost his {A.B.C}. to
419   *weep like a yong wench that had buried her Grandam:
420   *to fast, like one that takes diet: to watch, like one that
421   *feares robbing: to speake puling, like a beggar at Hal-low- Masse:
422   *You were wont, when you laughed, to crow
423   *like a cocke; when you walk'd, to walke like one of the
424   *Lions: when you fasted, it was presently after dinner:
425   *when you look'd sadly, it was for want of money: And
426   *now you are Metamorphis'd with a Mistris, that when I
427    looke on you, I can hardly thinke you my Master.
428    <S {Val}.> Are all these things perceiu'd in me?
429    <S {Speed}.> They are all perceiu'd without ye.
430    <S {Val}.> Without me? they cannot.
431   *<S {Speed}.> Without you? nay, that's certaine: for with-out
432   *you were so simple, none else would: but you are
433   *so without these follies, that these follies are within you,
434   *and shine through you like the water in an Vrinall: that
435   *not an eye that sees you, but is a Physician to comment
436    on your Malady.
437    <S {Val}.> But tell me: do'st thou know my Lady {Siluia}?
438   *<S {Speed}.> Shee that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
439    <S {Val}.> Hast thou obseru'd that? euen she I meane.
440    <S {Speed}.> Why sir, I know her not.
441   *<S {Val}.> Do'st thou know her by my gazing on her, and
442    yet know'st her not?
443    <S {Speed}.> Is she not hard- fauour'd, sir?
444    <S {Val}.> Not so faire (boy) as well fauour'd.
445    <S {Speed}.> Sir, I know that well enough.
446    <S {Val}.> What dost thou know?
447   *<S {Speed}.> That shee is not so faire, as (of you) well- fa-uourd?
448   _
449    <S {Val}.> I meane that her beauty is exquisite,
450    But her fauour infinite.
451   *<S {Speed}.> That's because the one is painted, and the o-ther
452    out of all count.
453    <S {Val}.> How painted? and how out of count?
454   *<S {Speed}.> Marry sir, so painted to make her faire, that no
455    man counts of her beauty.
456   *<S {Val}.> How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
457    <S {Speed}.> You neuer saw her since she was deform'd.
458    <S {Val}.> How long hath she beene deform'd?
459    <S {Speed}.> Euer since you lou'd her.
460    <S {Val}.> I haue lou'd her euer since I saw her,
461    And still I see her beautifull.
462    <S {Speed}.> If you loue her, you cannot see her.
463    <S {Val}.> Why?
464   *<S {Speed}.> Because Loue is blinde: O that you had mine
465   *eyes, or your owne eyes had the lights they were wont
466   *to haue, when you chidde at Sir {Protheus}, for going vn-garter'd.
467    <S {Val}.> What should I see then?
468   *<S {Speed}.> Your owne present folly, and her passing de-formitie:
469   *for hee beeing in loue, could not see to garter
470   *his hose; and you, beeing in loue, cannot see to put on
471    your hose.
472   *<S {Val}.> Belike (boy) then you are in loue, for last mor-|(ning
473    You could not see to wipe my shooes.
474   *<S {Speed}.> True sir: I was in loue with my bed, I thanke
475   *you, you swing'd me for my loue, which makes mee the
      <P B6v>
476    bolder to chide you, for yours.
477    <S {Val}.> In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
478   *<S {Speed}.> I would you were set, so your affection would
479    cease.
480    <S {Val}.> Last night she enioyn'd me,
481    To write some lines to one she loues.
482    <S {Speed}.> And haue you?
483    <S {Val}.> I haue.
484    <S {Speed}.> Are they not lamely writt?
485    <S {Val}.> No (Boy) but as well as I can do them:
486    Peace, here she comes.
487   *<S {Speed}.> Oh excellent motion; oh exceeding Puppet:
488    Now will he interpret to her.
489   *<S {Val}.> Madam & Mistres, a thousand good- morrows.
490   *<S {Speed}.> Oh, 'giue ye- good- ev'n: heer's a million of
491    manners.
492    <S {Sil}.> Sir {Valentine}, and seruant, to you two thousand.
493   *<S {Speed}.> He should giue her interest: & she giues it him.
494    <S {Val}.> As you inioynd me; I haue writ your Letter
495    Vnto the secret, nameles friend of yours:
496    Which I was much vnwilling to proceed in,
497    But for my duty to your Ladiship.
498   *<S {Sil}.> I thanke you (gentle Seruant) 'tis very Clerkly-|(#done.
499    <S {Val}.> Now trust me (Madam) it came hardly- off:
500    For being ignorant to whom it goes,
501    I writ at randome, very doubtfully.
502   *<S {Sil}.> Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
503    <S {Val}.> No (Madam) so it steed you, I will write
504    (Please you command) a thousand times as much:
505    And yet ===
506    <S {Sil}.> A pretty period: well: I ghesse the sequell;
507    And yet I will not name it: and yet I care not.
508    And yet, take this againe: and yet I thanke you:
509    Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
510    <S {Speed}.> And yet you will: and yet, another yet.
511    <S {Val}.> What meanes your Ladiship?
512    Doe you not like it?
513    <S {Sil}.> Yes, yes: the lines are very queintly writ,
514    But (since vnwillingly) take them againe.
515    Nay, take them.
516    <S {Val}.> Madam, they are for you.
517    <S {Silu}.> #I, #I: you writ them Sir, at my request,
518    But I will none of them: they are for you:
519    I would haue had them writ more mouingly:
520    <S {Val}.> Please you, Ile write your Ladiship another.
521    <S {Sil}.> And when it's writ: for my sake read it ouer,
522    And if it please you, so: if not: why so:
523    <S {Val}.> If it please me, (Madam?) what then?
524    <S {Sil}.> Why if it please you, take it for your labour;
525    And so good- morrow Seruant.  <D {Exit. Sil}.>
526    <S {Speed}.> Oh Iest vnseene: inscrutible: inuisible,
527   *As a nose on a mans face, or a Wethercocke on a steeple:
528    My Master sues to her: and she hath taught her Sutor,
529    He being her Pupill, to become her Tutor.
530    Oh excellent deuise, was there euer heard a better?
531    That my master being scribe,
532    To himselfe should write the Letter?
533    <S {Val}.> How now Sir?
534    What are you reasoning with your selfe?
535   *<S {Speed}.> Nay: I was riming: 'tis you y haue the reason.
536    <S {Val}.> To doe what?
537    <S {Speed}.> To be a Spokes- man from Madam {Siluia}.
538    <S {Val}.> To whom?
539   *<S {Speed}.> To your selfe: why, she woes you by a figure.
540    <S {Val}.> What figure?
541    <S {Speed}.> By a Letter, I should say.
542    <S {Val}.> Why she hath not writ to me?
543    <S {Speed}.> What need she,
544    When shee hath made you write to your selfe?
545    Why, doe you not perceiue the iest?
546    <S {Val}.> No, beleeue me.
547    <S {Speed}.> No beleeuing you indeed sir:
548    But did you perceiue her earnest?
549    <S {Val}.> She gaue me none, except an angry word.
550    <S {Speed}.> Why she hath giuen you a Letter.
551    <S {Val}.> That's the Letter I writ to her friend.
552   *<S {Speed}.> And y letter hath she deliuer'd, & there an end.
553    <S {Val}.> I would it were no worse.
554    <S {Speed}.> Ile warrant you, 'tis as well:
555    For often haue you writ to her: and she in modesty,
556    Or else for want of idle time, could not againe reply,
557   *Or fearing els some messe[n]ger, y might her mind discouer
558   *Her self hath taught her Loue himself, to write vnto her |(louer.
559    All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
560    Why muse you sir, 'tis dinner time.
561    <S {Val}.> I haue dyn'd.
562   *<S {Speed}.> #I, but hearken sir: though the Cameleon Loue
563   *can feed on the ayre, I am one that am nourish'd by my
564   *victuals; and would faine haue meate: oh bee not like
565    your Mistresse, be moued, be moued.  <D {Exeunt}.>
566    <Z {Scoena secunda}.>
567    <D {Enter Protheus, Iulia, Panthion}.>
568    <S {Pro}.> Haue patience, gentle {Iulia}:
569    <S {Iul}.> I must where is no remedy.
570    <S {Pro}.> When possibly I can, I will returne.
571    <S {Iul}.> If you turne not: you will return the sooner:
572    Keepe this remembrance for thy {Iulia's} sake.
573    <S {Pro}.> Why then wee'll make exchange;
574    Here, take you this.
575    <S {Iul}.> And seale the bargaine with a holy kisse.
576    <S {Pro}.> Here is my hand, for my true constancie:
577    And when that howre ore- slips me in the day,
578    Wherein I sigh not ({Iulia}) for thy sake,
579    The next ensuing howre, some foule mischance
580    Torment me for my Loues forgetfulnesse:
581    My father staies my comming: answere not:
582    The tide is now; nay, not thy tide of teares,
583    That tide will stay me longer then I should,
584    {Iulia}, farewell: what, gon without a word?
585    #I, so true loue should doe: it cannot speake,
586    For truth hath better deeds, then words to grace it.
587    <S {Panth}.> Sir {Protheus}: you are staid for.
588    <S {Pro}.> Goe: I come, I come:
589    Alas, this parting strikes poore Louers dumbe.
590    <D {Exeunt}.>
591    <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
592    <D {Enter Launce, Panthion}.>
593   *<S {Launce}.> Nay, 'twill bee this howre ere I haue done
594   *weeping: all the kinde of the {Launces}, haue this very
595   *fault: I haue receiu'd my proportion, like the prodigious
      <P C1>
596   *Sonne, and am going with Sir {Protheus} to the Imperialls
597   *Court: I thinke {Crab} my dog, be the sowrest natured
598   *dogge that liues: My Mother weeping: my Father
599   *wayling: my Sister crying: our Maid howling: our
600   *Catte wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
601   *perplexitie, yet did not this cruell- hearted Curre shedde
602   *one teare: he is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no
603   *more pitty in him then a dogge: a Iew would haue wept
604   *to haue seene our parting: why my Grandam hauing
605   *no eyes, looke you, wept her selfe blinde at my parting:
606   *nay, Ile shew you the manner of it. This shooe is my fa-ther:
607   *no, this left shooe is my father; no, no, this left
608   *shooe is my mother: nay, that cannot bee so neyther:
609   *yes; it is so, it is so: it hath the worser sole: this shooe
610   *with the hole in it, is my mother: and this my father:
611   *a veng'ance on't, there 'tis: Now sir, this staffe is my si-ster:
612   *for, looke you, she is as white as a lilly, and as
613   *small as a wand: this hat is {Nan} our maid: I am the
614   *dogge: no, the dogge is himselfe, and I am the dogge:
615   *oh, the dogge is me, and I am my selfe: #I;  so, so: now
616   *come I to my Father; Father, your blessing: now
617   *should not the shooe speake a word for weeping:
618   *now should I kisse my Father; well, hee weepes on:
619   *Now come I to my Mother: Oh that she could speake
620   *now, like a would- woman: well, I kisse her: why
621   *there 'tis; heere's my mothers breath vp and downe:
622   *Now come I to my sister; marke the moane she makes:
623   *now the dogge all this while sheds not a teare: nor
624   *speakes a word: but see how I lay the dust with my
625    teares.
626   *<S {Panth}.> {Launce}, away, away: #a Boord: thy Master is
627   *ship'd, and thou art to post after with oares; what's the
628   *matter? why weep'st thou man? away asse, you'l loose
629    the Tide, if you tarry any longer.
630   *<S {Laun}.> It is no matter if the tide were lost, for it is the
631    vnkindest Tide, that euer any man tide.
632    <S {Panth}.> What's the vnkindest tide?
633    <S {Lau}.> Why, he that's tide here, {Crab} my dog.
634   *<S {Pant}.> Tut, man: I meane thou'lt loose the flood, and
635   *in loosing the flood, loose thy voyage, and in loosing thy
636   *voyage, loose thy Master, and in loosing thy Master,
637   *loose thy seruice, and in loosing thy seruice: === why
638    dost thou stop my mouth?
639    <S {Laun}.> For feare thou shouldst loose thy tongue.
640    <S {Panth}.> Where should I loose my tongue?
641    <S {Laun}.> In thy Tale.
642    <S {Panth}.> In thy Taile.
643   *<S {Laun}.> Loose the Tide, and the voyage, and the Ma-ster,
644   *and the Seruice, and the tide: why man, if the Riuer
645   *were drie, I am able to fill it with my teares: if the winde
646    were downe, I could driue the boate with my sighes.
647   *<S {Panth}.> Come: come away man, I was sent to call
648    thee.
649    <S {Lau}.> Sir: call me what thou dar'st.
650    <S {Pant}.> Wilt thou goe?

656    <S {Val}.> Mistris.
657    <S {Spee}.> Master, Sir {Thurio} frownes on you.
658    <S {Val}.> #I Boy, it's for loue.
659    <S {Spee}.> Not of you.
660    <S {Val}.> Of my Mistresse then.
661    <S {Spee}.> 'Twere good you knockt him.
662    <S {Sil}.> Seruant, you are sad.
663    <S {Val}.> Indeed, Madam, I seeme so.
664    <S {Thu}.> Seeme you that you are not?
665    <S {Val}.> Hap'ly I doe.
666    <S {Thu}.> So doe Counterfeyts.
667    <S {Val}.> So doe you.
668    <S {Thu}.> What seeme I that I am not?
669    <S {Val}.> Wise.
670    <S {Thu}.> What instance of the contrary?
671    <S {Val}.> Your folly.
672    <S {Thu}.> And how quoat you my folly?
673    <S {Val}.> I quoat it in your Ierkin.
674    <S {Thu}.> My Ierkin is a doublet.
675    <S {Val}.> Well then, Ile double your folly.
676    <S {Thu}.> How?
677    <S {Sil}.> What, angry, Sir {Thurio}, do you change colour?

685    <S {Val}.> 'Tis indeed, Madam, we thank the giuer.
686    <S {Sil}.> Who is that Seruant?
687    <S {Val}.> Your selfe (sweet Lady) for you gaue the fire,
688   *Sir {Thurio} borrows his wit from your Ladiships lookes,
689   *And spends what he borrowes kindly in your company.
690   *<S {Thu}.> Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
691    make your wit bankrupt.
692   *<S {Val}.> I know it well sir: you haue an Exchequer of |(words,
693    And I thinke, no other treasure to giue your followers:
694    For it appeares by their bare Liueries
695    That they liue by your bare words.

701    Of much good newes?
702    <S {Val}.> My Lord, I will be thankfull,
703    To any happy messenger from thence.
704    <S {Duk}.> Know ye {#Don Antonio}, your Countriman?
705    <S {Val}.> #I,  my good Lord, I know the Gentleman
706    To be of worth, and worthy estimation,
707    And not without desert so well reputed.
708    <S {Duk}.> Hath he not a Sonne?
709    <S {Val}.> #I,  my good Lord, a Son, that well deserues
710    The honor, and regard of such a father.
711    <S {Duk}.> You know him well?
712    <S {Val}.> I knew him as my selfe: for from our Infancie
713    We haue conuerst, and spent our howres together,
714    And though my selfe haue beene an idle Trewant,
715    Omitting the sweet benefit of time
716    To cloath mine age with Angel- like perfection:
717    Yet hath Sir {Protheus} (for that's his name)
718    Made vse, and faire aduantage of his daies:
719    His yeares but yong, but his experience old:
720    His head vn- mellowed, but his Iudgement ripe;
721    And in a word (for far behinde his worth
722    Comes all the praises that I now bestow.)
      <P C1v>
723    He is compleat in feature, and in minde,
724    With all good grace, to grace a Gentleman.
725    <S {Duk}.> Beshrew me sir, but if he make this good
726    He is as worthy for an Empresse loue,
727    As meet to be an Emperors Councellor:
728    Well, Sir: this Gentleman is come to me
729    With Commendation from great Potentates,
730    And heere he meanes to spend his time #a while,
731    I thinke 'tis no vn- welcome newes to you.
732    <S {Val}.> Should I haue wish'd a thing, it had beene he.
733    <S {Duk}.> Welcome him then according to his worth:
734    {Siluia}, I speake to you, and you Sir {Thurio},
735    For {Valentine}, I need not cite him to it,
736    I will send him hither to you presently.
737    <S {Val}.> This is the Gentleman I told your Ladiship
738    Had come along with me, but that his Mistresse
739    Did hold his eyes, lockt in her Christall lookes.
740    <S {Sil}.> Be- like that now she hath enfranchis'd them
741    Vpon some other pawne for fealty.
742   *<S {Val}.> Nay sure, I thinke she holds them prisoners stil.
743    <S {Sil}.> Nay then he should be blind, and being blind
744    How could he see his way to seeke out you?
745    <S {Val}.> Why Lady, Loue hath twenty paire of eyes.
746    <S {Thur}.> They say that Loue hath not an eye at all.
747    <S {Val}.> To see such Louers, {Thurio}, as your selfe,
748    Vpon a homely obiect, Loue can winke.
749   *<S {Sil}.> Haue done, haue done: here comes y gentleman.
750   *<S {Val}.> Welcome, deer {Protheus}: Mistris, I beseech you
751    Confirme his welcome, with some speciall fauor.
752    <S {Sil}.> His worth is warrant for his welcome hether,
753    If this be he you oft haue wish'd to heare from.
754    <S {Val}.> Mistris, it is: sweet Lady, entertaine him
755    To be my fellow- seruant to your Ladiship.
756    <S {Sil}.> Too low a Mistres for so high a seruant.
757    <S {Pro}.> Not so, sweet Lady, but too meane a seruant
758    To haue a looke of such a worthy a Mistresse.
759    <S {Val}.> Leaue off discourse of disabilitie:
760    Sweet Lady, entertaine him for your Seruant.
761    <S {Pro}.> My dutie will I boast of, nothing else.
762    <S {Sil}.> And dutie neuer yet did want his meed.
763    Seruant, you are welcome to a worthlesse Mistresse.
764    <S {Pro}.> Ile die on him that saies so but your selfe.
765    <S {Sil}.> That you are welcome?
766    <S {Pro}.> That you are worthlesse.
767   *<S {Thur}.> Madam, my Lord your father wold speak with |(you.
768    <S {Sil}.> I wait vpon his pleasure: Come Sir {Thurio},
769    Goe with me: once more, new Seruant welcome;
770    Ile leaue you to confer of home affaires,
771    When you haue done, we looke #too  heare from you.
772    <S {Pro}.> Wee'll both attend vpon your Ladiship.
773   *<S {Val}.> Now tell me: how do al from whence you came?
774   *<S {Pro}.> Your frends are wel, & haue the[m] much co[m]mended.
775    <S {Val}.> And how doe yours?
776    <S {Pro}.> I left them all in health.
777   *<S {Val}.> How does your Lady? & how thriues your loue?
778    <S {Pro}.> My tales of Loue were wont to weary you,
779    I know you ioy not in a Loue- discourse.
780    <S {Val}.> #I  {Protheus}, but that life is alter'd now,
781    I haue done pennance for contemning Loue,
782    Whose high emperious thoughts haue punish'd me
783    With bitter fasts, with penitentiall grones,
784    With nightly teares, and daily hart- sore sighes,
785    For in reuenge of my contempt of loue,
786    Loue hath chas'd sleepe from my enthralled eyes,
787    And made them watchers of mine owne hearts sorrow.
788    O gentle {Protheus}, Loue's a mighty Lord,
789    And hath so humbled me, as I confesse
790    There is no woe to his correction,
791    Nor to his Seruice, no such ioy on earth:
792    Now, no discourse, except it be of loue:
793    Now can I breake my fast, dine, sup, and sleepe,
794    Vpon the very naked name of Loue.
795    <S {Pro}.> Enough; I read your fortune in your eye:
796    Was this the Idoll, that you worship so?
797    <S {Val}.> Euen She; and is she not a heauenly Saint?
798    <S {Pro}.> No; But she is an earthly Paragon.
799    <S {Val}.> Call her diuine.
800    <S {Pro}.> I will not flatter her.
801    <S {Val}.> O flatter me: for Loue delights in praises.
802    <S {Pro}.> When I was sick, you gaue me bitter pils,
803    And I must minister the like to you.
804    <S {Val}.> Then speake the truth by her; if not diuine,
805    Yet let her be a principalitie,
806    Soueraigne to all the Creatures on the earth.
807    <S {Pro}.> Except my Mistresse.
808    <S {Val}.> Sweet: except not any,
809    Except thou wilt except against my Loue.
810    <S {Pro}.> Haue I not reason to prefer mine owne?
811    <S {Val}.> And I will help thee to prefer her #to:
812    Shee shall be dignified with this high honour,
813    To beare my Ladies traine, lest the base earth
814    Should from her vesture chance to steale a kisse,
815    And of so great a fauor growing proud,
816    Disdaine to roote the Sommer- swelling flowre,
817    And make rough winter euerlastingly.
818    <S {Pro}.> Why {Valentine}, what Bragadisme is this?
819    <S {Val}.> Pardon me ({Protheus}) all I can is nothing,
820    To her, whose worth, make other worthies nothing;
821    Shee is alone.
822    <S {Pro}.> Then let her alone.
823   *<S {Val}.> Not for the world: why man, she is mine owne,
824    And I as rich in hauing such a Iewell
825    As twenty Seas, if all their sand were pearle,
826    The water, Nectar, and the Rocks pure gold.
827    Forgiue me, that I doe not dreame on thee,
828    Because thou seest me doate vpon my loue:
829    My foolish Riuall that her Father likes
830    (Onely for his possessions are so huge)
831    Is gone with her along, and I must after,
832    For Loue (thou know'st is full of iealousie.)
833    <S {Pro}.> But she loues you?
834   *<S {Val}.> #I, and we are betroathd: nay more, our mariage |(howre,
835    With all the cunning manner of our flight
836    Determin'd of: how I must climbe her window,
837    The Ladder made of Cords, and all the means
838    Plotted, and 'greed on for my happinesse.
839    Good {Protheus} goe with me to my chamber,
840    In these affaires to aid me with thy counsaile.
841    <S {Pro}.> Goe on before: I shall enquire you forth:
842    I must vnto the Road, to dis- embarque
843    Some necessaries, that I needs must vse,
844    And then Ile presently attend you.
845    <S {Val}.> Will you make haste?  <D {Exit}.>
846    <S {Pro}.> I will.
847    Euen as one heate, another heate expels,
848    Or as one naile, by strength driues out another.
849    So the remembrance of my former Loue
850    Is by a newer obiect quite forgotten,
851    It is mine, or {Valentines} praise?
852    Her true perfection, or my false transgression?
853    That makes me reasonlesse, to reason thus?
854    Shee is faire: and so is {Iulia} that I loue,
      <P C2>
855    (That I did loue, for now my loue is thaw'd,
856    Which like a waxen Image 'gainst a fire
857    Beares no impression of the thing it was.)
858    Me thinkes my zeale to {Valentine} is cold,
859    And that I loue him not as I was wont:
860    O, but I loue his Lady too- too much,
861    And that's the reason I loue him so little.
862    How shall I doate on her with more aduice,
863    That thus without aduice begin to loue her?
864    'Tis but her picture I haue yet beheld,
865    And that hath dazel'd my reasons light:
866    But when I looke on her perfections,
867    There is no reason, but I shall be blinde.
868    If I can checke my erring loue, I will,
869    If not, to compasse her Ile vse my skill.
870    <D {Exeunt}.>
871    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
872    <D {Enter} Speed {and} Launce.>
873    <S {Speed}.> {Launce}, by mine honesty welcome to {Padua}.
874   *<S {Laun}.> Forsweare not thy selfe, sweet youth, for I am
875   *not welcome. I reckon this alwaies, that a man is neuer
876   *vndon till hee be hang'd, nor neuer welcome to a place,
877   *till some certaine shot be paid, and the Hostesse say wel-come.
878   _
879   *<S {Speed}.> Come- on you mad- cap: Ile to the Ale- house
880   *with you presently; where, for one shot of fiue pence,
881   *thou shalt haue fiue thousand welcomes: But sirha, how
882    did thy Master part with Madam {Iulia}?
883   *<S {Lau}.> Marry after they cloas'd in earnest, they parted
884    very fairely in iest.
885    <S {Spee}.> But shall she marry him?
886    <S {Lau}.> No.
887    <S {Spee}.> How then? shall he marry her?
888    <S {Lau}.> No, neither.
889    <S {Spee}.> What, are they broken?
890    <S {Lau}.> No; they are both as whole as a fish.
891    <S {Spee}.> Why then, how stands the matter with them?
892   *<S {Lau}.> Marry thus, when it stands well with him, it
893    stands well with her.
894    <S {Spee}.> What an asse art thou, I vnderstand thee not.
895    <S {Lau}.> What a blocke art thou, that thou canst not?
896    My staffe vnderstands me?
897    <S {Spee}.> What thou saist?
898   *<S {Lau}.> #I,  and what I do too: looke thee, Ile but leane,
899    and my staffe vnderstands me.
900    <S {Spee}.> It stands vnder thee indeed.
901    <S {Lau}.> Why, stand- vnder: and vnder- stand is all one.
902    <S {Spee}.> But tell me true, #wil't  be a match?
903   *<S {Lau}.> Aske my dogge, if he say #I,  it will: if hee say
904   *no, it will: if hee shake his taile, and say nothing, it
905    will.
906    <S {Spee}.> The conclusion is then, that it will.
907   *<S {Lau}.> Thou shalt neuer get such a secret from me, but
908    by a parable.
909   *<S {Spee}.> 'Tis well that I get it so: but {Launce}, how saist
910    thou  that that my master is become a notable Louer?
911    <S {Lau}.> I neuer knew him otherwise.
912    <S {Spee}.> Then how?
913   *<S {Lau}.> A notable Lubber: as thou reportest him to
914    bee.
915    <S {Spee}.> Why, thou whorson Asse, thou mistak'st me,
916   *<S {Lau}.> Why Foole, I meant not thee, I meant thy
917    Master.
918    <S {Spee}.> I tell thee, my Master is become a hot Louer.
919   *<S {Lau}.> Why, I tell thee, I care not, though hee burne
920   *himselfe in Loue. If thou wilt goe with me to the Ale-house:
921   *if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Iew, and not worth
922    the name of a Christian.
923    <S {Spee}.> Why?
924   *<S {Lau}.> Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as
925    to goe to the Ale with a Christian: Wilt thou goe?
926    <S {Spee}.> At thy seruice.
927    <D {Exeunt}.>
928    <Z {Scoena Sexta}.>
929    <D {Enter} Protheus {solus}.>
930    <S {Pro}.> To leaue my {Iulia}; shall I be forsworne?
931    To loue faire {Siluia}; shall I be forsworne?
932    To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworne.
933    And ev'n that Powre which gaue me first my oath
934    Prouokes me to this three- fold periurie.
935    Loue bad mee sweare, and Loue bids me for- sweare;
936    O sweet- suggesting Loue, if thou hast sin'd,
937    Teach me (thy tempted subiect) to excuse it.
938    At first I did adore a twinkling Starre,
939    But now I worship a celestiall Sunne:
940    Vn- heedfull vowes may heedfully be broken,
941    And he wants wit, that wants resolued #will,
942    To learne his wit, t' exchange the bad for better;
943    Fie, fie, vnreuerend tongue, to call her bad,
944    Whose soueraignty so oft thou hast preferd,
945    With twenty thousand soule- confirming oathes.
946    I cannot leaue to loue; and yet I doe:
947    But there I leaue to loue, where I should loue.
948    {Iulia} I loose, and {Valentine} I loose,
949    If I keepe them, I needs must loose my selfe:
950    If I loose them, thus finde I by their losse,
951    For {Valentine}, my selfe: for {Iulia}, {Siluia}.
952    I to my selfe am deerer then a friend,
953    For Loue is still most precious in it selfe,
954    And {Siluia} (witnesse heauen that made her faire)
955    Shewes {Iulia} but a swarthy Ethiope.
956    I will forget that {Iulia} is aliue,
957    Remembring that my Loue to her is dead.
958    And {Valentine} Ile hold an Enemie,
959    Ayming at {Siluia} as a sweeter friend.
960    I cannot now proue constant to my selfe,
961    Without some treachery vs'd to {Valentine}.
962    This night he meaneth with a Corded- ladder
963    To climbe celestiall {Siluia's} chamber window,
964    My selfe in counsaile his competitor.
965    Now presently Ile giue her father notice
966    Of their disguising and pretended flight:
967    Who (all inrag'd) will banish {Valentine}:
968    For {Thurio} he intends shall wed his daughter,
969    But {Valentine} being gon, Ile quickely crosse
970    By some slie tricke, blunt {Thurio's} dull proceeding.
971    {Loue} lend me wings, to make my purpose swift
972    As thou hast lent me wit, to plot this drift.
973    <D {Exit}.>
      <P C2v>
974    <Z {Scoena septima}.>
975    <D {Enter} Iulia {and} Lucetta.>
976    <S {Iul}.> Counsaile, {Lucetta}, gentle girle assist me,
977    And eu'n in kinde loue, I doe coniure thee,
978    Who art the Table wherein all my thoughts
979    Are visibly Character'd, and engrau'd,
980    To lesson me, and tell me some good meane
981    How with my honour I may vndertake
982    A iourney to my louing {Protheus}.
983    <S {Luc}.> Alas, the way is wearisome and long.
984    <S {Iul}.> A true- deuoted Pilgrime is not weary
985    To measure Kingdomes with his feeble steps,
986    Much lesse shall she that hath Loues wings to flie,
987    And when the flight is made to one so deere,
988    Of such diuine perfection as Sir {Protheus}.
989    <S {Luc}.> Better forbeare, till {Protheus} make returne.
990   *<S {Iul}.> Oh, know'st y not, his looks are my soules food?
991    Pitty the dearth that I haue pined in,
992    By longing for that food so long a time.
993    Didst thou but know the inly touch of Loue,
994    Thou wouldst as soone goe kindle fire with snow
995    As seeke to quench the fire of Loue with words.
996    <S {Luc}.> I doe not seeke to quench your Loues hot fire,
997    But qualifie the fires extreame rage,
998    Lest it should burne aboue the bounds of reason.
999    <S {Iul}.> The more thou dam'st it vp, the more it burnes:
1000   The Current that with gentle murmure glides
1001   (Thou know'st) being stop'd, impatiently doth rage:
1002   But when his faire course is not hindered,
1003   He makes sweet musicke with th' enameld stones,
1004   Giuing a gentle kisse to euery sedge
1005   He ouer- taketh in his pilgrimage.
1006   And so by many winding nookes he straies
1007   With willing sport to the wilde Ocean.
1008   Then let me goe, and hinder not my course:
1009   Ile be as patient as a gentle streame,
1010   And make a pastime of each weary step,
1011   Till the last step haue brought me to my Loue,
1012   And there Ile rest, as after much turmoile
1013   A blessed soule doth in {Elizium}.
1014   <S {Luc}.> But in what habit will you goe along?
1015   <S {Iul}.> Not like a woman, for I would preuent
1016   The loose encounters of lasciuious men:
1017   Gentle {Lucetta}, fit me with such weedes
1018   As may beseeme some well reputed Page.
1019   <S {Luc}.> Why then your Ladiship must cut your haire.
1020   <S {Iul}.> No girle, Ile knit it vp in silken strings,
1021   With twentie od- conceited true- loue knots:
1022   To be fantastique, may become a youth
1023   Of  greater time then I shall shew to be.
1024  *<S {Luc}.> What fashion (Madam) shall I make your bree-|(ches?
1025   <S {Iul}.> That fits as well, as tell me (good my Lord)
1026   What compasse will you weare your Farthingale?
1027   Why eu'n what fashion thou best likes ({Lucetta}.)
1028  *<S {Luc}.> You must needs haue the[m] with a cod- peece |(Ma-[dam]
1029   <S {Iul}.> Out, out, ({Lucetta}) that wilbe illfauourd.
1030   <S {Luc}.> A round hose (Madam) now's not worth a pin
1031   Vnlesse you haue a cod- peece to stick pins on.
1032   <S {Iul}.> {Lucetta}, as thou lou'st me let me haue
1033   What thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.
1034   But tell me (wench) how will the world repute me
1035   For vndertaking so vnstaid a iourney?
1036   I feare me it will make me scandaliz'd.
1037  *<S {Luc}.> If you thinke so, then stay at home, and go not.
1038   <S {Iul}.> Nay, that I will not.
1039   <S {Luc}.> Then neuer dreame on Infamy, but go:
1040   If {Protheus} like your iourney, when you come,
1041   No matter who's displeas'd, when you are gone:
1042   I feare me he will scarce be pleas'd with all.
1043   <S {Iul}.> That is the least ({Lucetta}) of my feare:
1044   A thousand oathes, an Ocean of his teares,
1045   And instances of infinite of Loue,
1046   Warrant me welcome to my {Protheus}.
1047   <S {Luc}.> All these are seruants to deceitfull men.
1048   <S {Iul}.> Base men, that vse them to so base effect;
1049   But truer starres did gouerne {Protheus} birth,
1050   His words are bonds, his oathes are oracles,
1051   His loue sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
1052   His teares, pure messengers, sent from his heart,
1053   His heart, as far from fraud, as heauen from earth.
1054  *<S {Luc}.> Pray heau'n he proue so when you come to him.
1055   <S {Iul}.> Now, as thou lou'st me, do him not that wrong,
1056   To beare a hard opinion of his truth:
1057   Onely deserue my loue, by louing him,
1058   And presently goe with me to my chamber
1059   To take a note of what I stand in need of,
1060   To furnish me vpon my longing iourney:
1061   All that is mine I leaue at thy dispose,
1062   My goods, my Lands, my reputation,
1063   Onely, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence:
1064   Come; answere not: but to it presently,
1065   I am impatient of my tarriance.

1068   <D {Enter Duke, Thurio, Protheus, Valentine},
1069   {Launce, Speed}.>
1070   <S {Duke}.> Sir {Thurio}, giue vs leaue (I pray) #a while,
1071   We haue some secrets to confer about.
1072   Now tell me {Protheus}, what's your #will with me?
1073  *<S {Pro}.> My gracious Lord, that which I wold discouer,
1074   The Law of friendship bids me to conceale,
1075   But when I call to minde your gracious fauours
1076   Done to me (vndeseruing as I am)
1077   My dutie pricks me on to vtter that
1078   Which else, no worldly good should draw from me:
1079   Know (worthy Prince) Sir {Valentine} my friend
1080   This night intends to steale away your daughter:
1081   My selfe am one made priuy to the plot.
1082   I know you haue determin'd to bestow her
1083   On {Thurio}, whom your gentle daughter hates,
1084   And should she thus be stolne away from you,
1085   It would be much vexation to your age.
1086   Thus (for my duties sake) I rather chose
1087   To crosse my friend in his intended drift,
1088   Then (by concealing it) heap on your head
1089   A pack of sorrowes, which would presse you downe
1090   (Being vnpreuented) to your timelesse graue.
1091   <S {Duke}.> {Protheus}, I thank thee for thine honest care,
1092   Which to requite, command me while I liue.
1093   This loue of theirs, my selfe haue often seene,
1094   Haply when they haue iudg'd me fast asleepe,
1095   And oftentimes haue purpos'd to forbid
      <P C3>
1096   Sir {Valentine} her companie, and my Court.
1097   But fearing lest my iealous ayme might erre,
1098   And so (vnworthily) disgrace the man
1099   (A rashnesse that I euer yet haue shun'd)
1100   I gaue him gentle lookes, thereby to finde
1101   That which thy selfe hast now disclos'd to me.
1102   And that thou maist perceiue my feare of this,
1103   Knowing that tender youth is soone suggested,
1104   I nightly lodge her in an vpper Towre,
1105   The key whereof, my selfe haue euer kept:
1106   And thence she cannot be conuay'd away.
1107   <S {Pro}.> Know (noble Lord) they haue deuis'd a meane
1108   How he her chamber- window will ascend,
1109   And with a Corded- ladder fetch her downe:
1110   For which, the youthfull Louer now is gone,
1111   And this way comes he with it presently.
1112   Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.
1113   But (good my Lord) doe it so cunningly
1114   That my discouery be not aimed at:
1115   For, loue of you, not hate vnto my friend,
1116   Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
1117   <S {Duke}.> Vpon mine Honor, he shall neuer know
1118   That I had any light from thee of this.
1119   <S {Pro}.> Adiew, my Lord, Sir {Valentine} is comming.
1120   <S {Duk}.> Sir {Valentine}, whether away so fast?
1121   <S {Val}.> Please it your Grace, there is a Messenger
1122   That stayes to beare my Letters to my friends,
1123   And I am going to deliuer them.
1124   <S {Duk}.> Be they of much import?
1125   <S {Val}.> The tenure of them doth but signifie
1126   My health, and happy #being at your Court.
1127   <S {Duk}.> Nay then no matter: stay with me #a while,
1128   I am to breake with thee of some affaires
1129   That touch me neere: wherein thou must be secret.
1130   'Tis not vnknown to thee, that I haue sought
1131   To match my friend Sir {Thurio}, to my daughter.
1132   <S {Val}.> I know it well (my Lord) and sure the Match
1133   Were rich and honourable: besides, the gentleman
1134   Is full of Vertue, Bounty, Worth, and Qualities
1135   Beseeming such a Wife, as your faire daughter:
1136   Cannot your Grace win her to fancie him?
1137   <S {Duk}.> No, trust me, She is peeuish, sullen, froward,
1138   Prowd, disobedient, stubborne, lacking duty,
1139   Neither regarding that she is my childe,
1140   Nor fearing me, as if I were her father:
1141   And may I say to thee, this pride of hers
1142   (Vpon aduice) hath drawne my loue from her,
1143   And where I thought the remnant of mine age
1144   Should haue beene cherish'd by her child- like dutie,
1145   I now am full resolu'd to take a wife,
1146   And turne her out, to who will take her in:
1147   Then let her beauty be her wedding dowre:
1148   For me, and my possessions she esteemes not.
1149  *<S {Val}.> What would your Grace haue me to do in this?
1150   <S {Duk}.> There is a Lady in {Verona} heere
1151   Whom I affect: but she is nice, and coy,
1152   And naught esteemes my aged eloquence.
1153   Now therefore would I haue thee to my Tutor
1154   (For long agone I haue forgot to court,
1155   Besides the fashion of the time is chang'd)
1156   How, and which way I may bestow my selfe
1157   To be regarded in her sun- bright eye.
1158   <S {Val}.> Win her with gifts, if she respect not words,
1159   Dumbe Iewels often in their silent kinde
1160   More then quicke words, doe moue a womans minde.
1161   <S {Duk}.> But she did scorne a present that I sent her,
1162  *<S {Val}.> A woman somtime scorns what best co[n]tents her.
1163   Send her another: neuer giue her ore,
1164   For scorne at first, makes after- loue the more.
1165   If she doe frowne, 'tis not in hate of you,
1166   But rather to beget more loue in you.
1167   If she doe chide, 'tis not to haue you gone,
1168   For why, the fooles are mad, if left alone.
1169   Take no repulse, what euer she doth say,
1170   For, get you gon, she doth not meane away.
1171   Flatter, and praise, commend, extoll their graces:
1172   Though nere so blacke, say they haue Angells faces,
1173   That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,
1174   If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
1175   <S {Duk}.> But she I meane, is promis'd by her friends
1176   Vnto a youthfull Gentleman of worth,
1177   And kept seuerely from resort of men,
1178   That no man hath accesse by day to her.
1179   <S {Val}.> Why then I would resort to her by night.
1180  *<S {Duk}.> #I, but the doores be lockt, and keyes kept safe,
1181   That no man hath recourse to her by night.
1182   <S {Val}.> What letts but one may enter at her window?
1183   <S {Duk}.> Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
1184   And built so sheluing, that one cannot climbe it
1185   Without apparant hazard of his life.
1186   <S {Val}.> Why then a Ladder quaintly made of Cords
1187   To cast vp, with a paire of anchoring hookes,
1188   Would serue to scale another {Hero's} towre,
1189   So bold {Leander} would aduenture it.
1190   <S {Duk}.> Now as thou art a Gentleman of blood
1191   Aduise me, where I may haue such a Ladder.
1192   <S {Val}.> When would you vse it? pray sir, tell me that.
1193   <S {Duk}.> This very night; for Loue is like a childe
1194   That longs for euery thing that he can come by.
1195   <S {Val}.> By seauen #a clock, ile get you such a Ladder.
1196   <S {Duk}> But harke thee: I will goe to her alone,
1197   How shall I best conuey the Ladder thither?
1198   <S {Val}.> It will be light (my Lord) that you may beare it
1199   Vnder a cloake, that is of any length.
1200   <S {Duk}.> A cloake as long as thine will serue the turne?
1201   <S {Val}.> #I my good Lord.
1202   <S {Duk}.> Then let me see thy cloake,
1203   Ile get me one of such another length.
1204  *<S {Val}.> Why any cloake will serue the turn (my Lord)
1205   <S {Duk}.> How shall I fashion me to weare a cloake?
1206   I pray thee let me feele thy cloake vpon me.
1207   What Letter is this same? what's here? to {Siluia}?
1208   And heere an Engine fit for my proceeding,
1209   Ile be so bold to breake the seale for once.
1210   {My thoughts do harbour with my} Siluia {nightly},
1211   {And slaues they are to me, that send them flying}.
1212   {Oh, could their Master come, and goe as lightly},
1213   {Himselfe would lodge where (senceles) they are lying}.
1214   {My Herald Thoughts, in thy pure bosome rest- them},
1215   {While I (their King) that thither them importune}
1216   {Doe curse the grace, that with such grace hath blest them},
1217   {Because my selfe doe want my seruants fortune}.
1218   {I curse my selfe, for they are sent by me},
1219   {That they should harbour where their Lord should be}.
1220   What's here? {Siluia, this night I will enfranchise thee}.
1221   'Tis so: and heere's the Ladder for the purpose.
1222   Why {Phaeton} (for thou art {Merops} sonne)
1223   Wilt thou aspire to guide the heauenly Car?
1224   And with thy daring folly burne the world?
1225   Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
      <P C3v>
1226   Goe base Intruder, ouer- weening Slaue,
1227   Bestow thy fawning smiles on equall mates,
1228   And thinke my patience, (more then thy desert)
1229   Is priuiledge for thy departure hence.
1230   Thanke me for this, more then for all the fauors
1231   Which (all too- much) I haue bestowed on thee.
1232   But if thou linger in my Territories
1233   Longer then swiftest expedition
1234   Will giue thee time to leaue our royall Court,
1235   By heauen, my wrath shall farre exceed the loue
1236   I euer bore my daughter, or thy selfe.
1237   Be gone, I will not heare thy vaine excuse,
1238   But as thou lou'st thy life, make speed from hence.
1239  *<S {Val}.> And why not death, rather then liuing torment?
1240   To die, is to be banisht from my selfe,
1241   And {Siluia} is my selfe: banish'd from her
1242   Is selfe from selfe. A deadly banishment:
1243   What light, is light, if {Siluia} be not seene?
1244   What ioy is ioy, if {Siluia} be not by?
1245   Vnlesse it be to thinke that she is by
1246   And feed vpon the shadow of perfection.
1247   Except I be by {Siluia} in the night,
1248   There is no musicke in the Nightingale.
1249   Vnlesse I looke on {Siluia} in the day,
1250   There is no day for me to looke vpon.
1251   Shee is my essence, and I leaue to be;
1252   If I be not by her faire influence
1253   Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept aliue.
1254   I flie not death, to flie his deadly doome,
1255   Tarry I heere, I but attend on death,
1256   But flie I hence, I flie away from life.
1257   <S {Pro}.> Run (boy) run, run, and seeke him out.
1258   <S {Lau}.> So- hough, Soa hough===
1259   <S {Pro}.> What seest thou?
1260   <S {Lau}.> Him we goe to finde,
1261   There's not a haire on's head, but 'tis a {Valentine}.
1262   <S {Pro}.> {Valentine}?
1263   <S {Val}.> No.
1264   <S {Pro}.> Who then? his Spirit?
1265   <S {Val}.> Neither,
1266   <S {Pro}.> What then?
1267   <S {Val}.> Nothing.
1268   <S {Lau}.> Can nothing speake? Master, shall I strike?
1269   <S {Pro}.> Who wouldst thou strike?
1270   <S {Lau}.> Nothing.
1271   <S {Pro}.> Villaine, forbeare.
1272   <S {Lau}.> Why Sir, Ile strike nothing: I pray you.
1273   <S {Pro}.> Sirha, I say forbeare: friend {Valentine}, a word.
1274  *<S {Val}.> My eares are stopt, & cannot hear good newes,
1275   So much of bad already hath possest them.
1276   <S {Pro}.> Then in dumbe silence will I bury mine,
1277   For they are harsh, vn- tuneable, and bad.
1278   <S {Val}.> Is {Siluia} dead?
1279   <S {Pro}.> No, {Valentine}.
1280   <S {Val}.> No {Valentine} indeed, for sacred {Siluia},
1281   Hath she forsworne me?
1282   <S {Pro}.> No, {Valentine}.
1283   <S {Val}.> No {Valentine}, if {Siluia} haue forsworne me.
1284   What is your newes?
1285  *<S {Lau}.> Sir, there is a proclamation, y you are vanished.
1286   <S {Pro}.> That thou art banish'd: oh that's the newes,
1287   From hence, from {Siluia}, and from me thy friend.
1288   <S {Val}.> Oh, I haue fed vpon this woe already,
1289   And now excesse of it will make me surfet.
1290   Doth {Siluia} know that I am banish'd?
1291   <S {Pro}.> #I, #I: and she hath offered to the doome
1292   (Which vn- reuerst stands in effectuall force)
1293   A Sea of melting pearle, which some call teares;
1294   Those at her fathers churlish feete she tenderd,
1295   With them vpon her knees, her humble selfe,
1296  *Wringing her hands, whose whitenes so became them,
1297   As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
1298   But neither bended knees, pure hands held vp,
1299   Sad sighes, deepe grones, nor siluer- shedding teares
1300   Could penetrate her vncompassionate Sire;
1301   But {Valentine}, if he be tane, must die.
1302   Besides, her intercession chaf'd him so,
1303   When she for thy repeale was suppliant,
1304   That to close prison he commanded her,
1305   With many bitter threats of biding there.
1306  *<S {Val}.> No more: vnles the next word that thou speak'st
1307   Haue some malignant power vpon my life:
1308   If so: I pray thee breath it in mine eare,
1309   As ending Antheme of my endlesse dolor.
1310   <S {Pro}.> Cease to lament for that thou canst not helpe,
1311   And study helpe for that which thou lament'st,
1312   Time is the Nurse, and breeder of all good;
1313   Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy loue:
1314   Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life:
1315   Hope is a louers staffe, walke hence with that
1316   And manage it, against despairing thoughts:
1317   Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
1318   Which, being writ to me, shall be deliuer'd
1319   Euen in the milke- white bosome of thy Loue.
1320   The time now serues not to expostulate,
1321   Come, Ile conuey thee through the City- gate.
1322   And ere I part with thee, confer at large
1323   Of all that may concerne thy Loue- affaires:
1324   As thou lou'st {Siluia} (though not for thy selfe)
1325   Regard thy danger, and along with me.
1326   <S {Val}.> I pray thee {Launce}, #and if thou seest my Boy
1327   Bid him make haste, and meet me at the North- gate.
1328   <S {Pro}.> Goe sirha, finde him out: Come {Valentine}.
1329   <S {Val}.> Oh my deere {Siluia}; haplesse {Valentine}.
1330  *<S {Launce}.> I am but a foole, looke you, and yet I haue
1331  *the wit to thinke my Master is a kinde of a knaue: but
1332  *that's all one, if he be but one knaue: He liues not now
1333  *that knowes me to be in loue, yet I am in loue, but a
1334  *Teeme of horse shall not plucke that from me: nor who
1335  *'tis I loue: and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
1336  *will not tell my selfe: and yet 'tis a Milke- maid: yet 'tis
1337  *not a maid: for shee hath had Gossips: yet 'tis a maid,
1338  *for she is her Masters maid, and serues for wages. Shee
1339  *hath more qualities then a Water- Spaniell, which is
1340  *much in a bare Christian: Heere is the Cate-log of her
1341  *Condition. {Inprimis}. Shee can fetch and carry: why
1342  *a horse can doe no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but
1343  *onely carry, therefore is shee better then a Iade. {Item}.
1344  *She can milke, looke you, a sweet vertue in a maid with
1345   cleane hands.
1346  *<S {Speed}.> How now Signior {Launce}? what newes with
1347   your Mastership?
1348   <S {La}.> With my Mastership? why, it is at Sea:
1349  *<S {Sp}.> Well, your old vice still: mistake the word: what
1350   newes then in your paper?
1351   <S {La}.> The black'st newes that euer thou heard'st.
1352   <S {Sp}.> Why man? how blacke?
1353   <S {La}.> Why, as blacke as Inke.
1354   <S {Sp}.> Let me read them?
1355   <S {La}.> Fie on thee Iolt- head, thou canst not read.
1356   <S {Sp}.> Thou lyest: I can.
1357   <S {La}.> I will try thee: tell me this: who begot thee?
      <P C4><C D>
1358   <S {Sp}.> Marry, the son of my Grand- father.
1359  *<S {La}.> Oh illiterate loyterer; it was the sonne of thy
1360   Grand- mother: this proues that thou canst not read.
1361   <S {Sp}.> Come foole, come: try me in thy paper.
1362   <S {La}.> There: and S[aint]. {Nicholas} be thy speed.
1363   <S {Sp}.> Inprimis she can milke.
1364   <S {La}.> #I that she can.
1365   <S {Sp}.> Item, she brewes good Ale.
1366  *<S {La}.> And thereof comes the prouerbe: ({Blessing of}
1367   {your heart, you brew good Ale}.)
1368   <S {Sp}.> Item, she can sowe.
1369   <S {La}.> That's as much as to say ({Can she so?})
1370   <S {Sp}.> Item she can knit.
1371  *<S {La}.> What neede a man care for a stock with a wench,
1372   When she can knit him a stocke?
1373   <S {Sp}.> Item, she can wash and scoure.
1374  *<S {La}.> A speciall vertue: for then shee neede not be
1375   wash'd, and scowr'd.
1376   <S {Sp}.> Item, she can spin.
1377  *<S {La}.> Then may I set the world on wheeles, when she
1378   can spin for her liuing.
1379   <S {Sp}.> Item, she hath many namelesse vertues.
1380  *<S {La}.> That's as much as to say {Bastard- vertues}: that
1381  *indeede know not their fathers; and therefore haue no
1382   names.
1383   <S {Sp}.> Here follow her vices.
1384   <S {La}.> Close at the heeles of her vertues.
1385  *<S {Sp}.> Item, shee is not to be fasting in respect of her
1386   breath.
1387  *<S {La}.> Well: that fault may be mended with a break-fast:
1388   read on.
1389   <S {Sp}.> Item, she hath a sweet mouth.
1390   <S {La}.> That makes amends for her soure breath.
1391   <S {Sp}.> Item, she doth talke in her sleepe.
1392  *<S {La}.> It's no matter for that; so shee sleepe not in her
1393   talke.
1394   <S {Sp}.> Item, she is slow in words.
1395  *<S {La}.> Oh villaine, that set this downe among her vices;
1396   To be slow in words, is a womans onely vertue:
1397  *I pray thee out with't, and place it for her chiefe vertue.
1398   <S {Sp}.> Item, she is proud.
1399   <S {La}.> Out with that too:
1400   It was {Eues} legacie, and cannot be t'ane from her.
1401   <S {Sp}.> Item, she hath no teeth.
1402  *<S {La}.> I care not for that neither: because I loue crusts.
1403   <S {Sp}.> Item, she is curst.
1404   <S {La}.> Well: the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
1405   <S {Sp}.> Item, she will often praise her liquor.
1406  *<S {La}.> If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not,
1407   I will; for good things should be praised.
1408   <S {Sp}.> Item, she is too liberall.
1409  *<S {La}.> Of her tongue she cannot; for that's writ downe
1410  *she is slow of: of her purse, shee shall not, for that ile
1411  *keepe shut: Now, of another thing shee may, and that
1412   cannot I helpe. Well, proceede.
1413  *<S {Sp}.> Item, shee hath more haire then wit, and more
1414   faults then haires, and more wealth then faults.
1415  *<S {La}.> Stop there: Ile haue her: she was mine, and not
1416  *mine, twice or thrice in that last Article: rehearse that
1417   once more.
1418   <S {Sp}.> Item, she hath more haire then wit.
1419  *<S {La}.> More haire then wit: it may be ile proue it: The
1420  *couer of the salt, hides the salt, and therefore it is more
1421  *then the salt; the haire that couers the wit, is more
1422  *then the wit; for the greater hides the lesse: What's
1423   next?
1424   <S {Sp}.> And more faults then haires.
1425   <S {La}.> That's monstrous: oh that that were out.
1426   <S {Sp}.> And more wealth then faults.
1427   <S {La}.> Why that word makes the faults gracious:
1428  *Well, ile haue her: #and if it be a match, as nothing is
1429   impossible.
1430   <S {Sp}.> What then?
1431  *<S {La}.> Why then, will I tell thee, that thy Master staies
1432   for thee at the {North gate}.
1433   <S {Sp}.> For me?
1434  *<S {La}.> For thee? #I, who art thou? he hath staid for a bet-ter
1435   man then thee.
1436   <S {Sp}.> And must I goe to him?
1437  *<S {La}.> Thou must run to him; for thou hast staid so long,
1438   that going will scarce serue the turne.
1439  *<S {Sp}.> Why didst not tell me sooner? 'pox of your loue
1440   Letters.
1441  *<S {La}.> Now will he be swing'd for reading my Letter;
1442  *An vnmannerly slaue, that will thrust himselfe into se-crets:
1443  *Ile after, to reioyce in the boyes correctio[n].  <D {Exeunt}.>
1444   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1445   <D {Enter Duke, Thurio, Protheus}.>
1446   <S {Du}.> Sir {Thurio}, feare not, but that she will loue you
1447   Now {Valentine} is banish'd from her sight.
1448   <S {Th}.> Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,
1449   Forsworne my company, and rail'd at me,
1450   That I am desperate of obtaining her.
1451   <S {Du}.> This weake impresse of Loue, is as a figure
1452   Trenched in ice, which with an houres heate
1453   Dissolues to water, and doth loose his forme.
1454   A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
1455   And worthlesse {Valentine} shall be forgot.
1456   How now sir {Protheus}, is your countriman
1457   (According to our Proclamation) gon?
1458   <S {Pro}.> Gon, my good Lord.
1459   <S {Du}.> My daughter takes his going grieuously?
1460   <S {Pro}.> A little time (my Lord) will kill that griefe.
1461   <S {Du}.> So I beleeue: but {Thurio} thinkes not so:
1462   {#Protheus}, the good conceit I hold of thee,
1463   (For thou hast showne some signe of good desert)
1464   Makes me the better to confer with thee.
1465   <S {Pro}.> Longer then I proue loyall to your Grace,
1466   Let me not liue, to looke vpon your Grace.
1467   <S {Du}.> Thou know'st how willingly, I would effect
1468   The match betweene sir {Thurio}, and my daughter?
1469   <S {Pro}.> I doe my Lord.
1470   <S {Du}.> And also, I thinke, thou art not ignorant
1471   How she opposes her against my #will?
1472   <S {Pro}.> She did my Lord, when {Valentine} was here.
1473   <S {Du}.> #I, and peruersly, she perseuers so:
1474   What might we doe to make the girle forget
1475   The loue of {Valentine}, and loue sir {Thurio}?
1476   <S {Pro}.> The best way is, to slander {Valentine},
1477   With falsehood, cowardize, and poore discent:
1478   Three things, that women highly hold in hate.
1479   <S {Du}.> #I, but she'll thinke, that it is spoke in hate.
1480   <S {Pro}.> #I, if his enemy deliuer it.
1481   Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
1482   By one, whom she esteemeth as his friend.
1483   <S {Du}.> Then you must vndertake to slander him.
      <P C4v>
1484   <S {Pro}.> And that (my Lord) I shall be loath to doe:
1485   'Tis an #ill office for a Gentleman,
1486   Especially against his very friend.
1487  *<S {Du}.> Where your good word cannot aduantage him,
1488   Your slander neuer can endamage him;
1489   Therefore the office is indifferent,
1490   Being intreated to it by your friend.
1491   <S {Pro}.> You haue preuail'd (my Lord) if I can doe it
1492   By ought that I can speake in his dispraise,
1493   She shall not long continue loue to him:
1494   But say this weede her loue from {Valentine},
1495   It followes not that she will loue sir {Thurio}.
1496   <S {Th}.> Therefore, as you vnwinde her loue from him;
1497   Least it should rauell, and be good to none,
1498   You must prouide to bottome it on me:
1499   Which must be done, by praising me as much
1500   As you, in worth dispraise, sir {Valentine}.
1501   <S {Du}.> And {Protheus}, we dare trust you in this kinde,
1502   Because we know (on {Valentines} report)
1503   You are already loues firme votary,
1504   And cannot soone reuolt, and change your minde.
1505   Vpon this warrant, shall you haue accesse,
1506   Where you, with {Siluia}, may conferre at large.
1507   For she is lumpish, heauy, mellancholly,
1508   And (for your friends sake) will be glad of you;
1509   Where you may temper her, by your perswasion,
1510   To hate yong {Valentine}, and loue my friend.
1511   <S {Pro}.> As much as I can doe, I will effect:
1512   But you sir {Thurio}, are not sharpe enough:
1513   You must lay Lime, to tangle her desires
1514   By walefull Sonnets, whose composed Rimes
1515   Should be full fraught with seruiceable vowes.
1516   <S {Du}.> #I, much is the force of heauen- bred Poesie.
1517   <S {Pro}.> Say that vpon the altar of her beauty
1518   You sacrifice your teares, your sighes, your heart:
1519   Write till your inke be dry: and with your teares
1520   Moist it againe: and frame some feeling line,
1521   That may discouer such integrity:
1522   For {Orpheus} Lute, was strung with Poets sinewes,
1523   Whose golden touch could soften steele and stones;
1524   Make Tygers tame, and huge {Leuiathans}
1525   Forsake vnsounded deepes, to dance on Sands.
1526   After your dire- lamenting Elegies,
1527   Visit by night your Ladies chamber- window
1528   With some sweet Consort; To their Instruments
1529   Tune a deploring dumpe: the nights dead silence
1530   Will well become such sweet complaining grieuance:
1531   This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
1532   <S {Du}.> This discipline, showes thou hast bin in loue.
1533   <S {Th}.> And thy aduice, this night, ile put in practise:
1534   Therefore, sweet {Protheus}, my direction- giuer,
1535   Let vs into the City presently
1536   To sort some Gentlemen, well skil'd in Musicke.
1537   I haue a Sonnet, that will serue the turne
1538   To giue the on- set to thy good aduise.
1539   <S {Du}.> About it Gentlemen.
1540   <S {Pro}.> #We'll wait vpon your Grace, till after Supper,
1541   And afterward determine our proceedings.
1542  *<S {Du}.> Euen now about it, I will pardon you.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1543   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scoena Prima}.>
1544   <D {Enter Valentine, Speed, and certaine Out- lawes}.>
1545   <S 1.{Out-l}.> Fellowes, stand fast: I see a passenger.
1546  *<S 2.{Out}.> If there be ten, shrinke not, but down with 'em.
1547  *<S 3.{Out}.> Stand sir, and throw vs that you haue about 'ye.
1548   If not: #we'll make you sit, and rifle you.
1549   <S {Sp}.> Sir we are vndone; these are the Villaines
1550   That all the Trauailers doe feare so much.
1551   <S {Val}.> My friends.
1552   <S 1.{Out}.> That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
1553   <S 2.{Out}.> Peace: #we'll heare him.
1554  *<S 3.{Out}.> #I by my beard will we: for he is a proper man.
1555   <S {Val}.> Then know that I haue little wealth to loose;
1556   A man I am, cross'd with aduersitie:
1557   My riches, are these poore habiliments,
1558   Of which, if you should here disfurnish me,
1559   You take the sum and substance that I haue.
1560   <S 2.{Out}.> Whether trauell you?
1561   <S {Val}.> To {Verona}.
1562   <S 1.{Out}.> Whence came you?
1563   <S {Val}.> From {Millaine}.
1564   <S 3.{Out}.> Haue you long soiourn'd there?
1565  *<S {Val}.> Some sixteene moneths, and longer might haue |(staid,
1566   If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
1567   <S 1.{Out}.> What, were you banish'd thence?
1568   <S {Val}.> I was.
1569   <S 2.{Out}.> For what offence?
1570   <S {Val}.> For that which now torments me to rehearse;
1571   I kil'd a man, whose death I much repent,
1572   But yet I slew him manfully, in fight,
1573   Without false vantage, or base treachery.
1574   <S 1.{Out}.> Why nere repent it, if it were done so;
1575   But were you banisht for so small a fault?
1576   <S {Val}.> I was, and held me glad of such a doome.
1577   <S 2.{Out}.> Haue you the Tongues?
1578   <S {Val}.> My youthfull trauaile, therein made me happy,
1579   Or else I often had beene often miserable.
1580   <S 3.{Out}.> By the bare scalpe of {Robin Hoods} fat Fryer,
1581   This fellow were a King, for our wilde faction.
1582   <S 1.{Out}.> #We'll haue him: Sirs, a word.
1583   <S {Sp}.> Master, be one of them:
1584   It's an honourable kinde of theeuery.
1585   <S {Val}.> Peace villaine.
1586   <S 2.{Out}.> Tell vs this: haue you any thing to take to?
1587   <S {Val}.> Nothing but my fortune.
1588   <S 3.{Out}.> Know then, that some of vs are Gentlemen,
1589   Such as the fury of vngouern'd youth
1590   Thrust from the company of awfull men.
1591   My selfe was from {Verona} banished,
1592   For practising to steale away a Lady,
1593   And heire and Neece, alide vnto the Duke.
1594   <S 2.{Out}.> And I from {Mantua}, for a Gentleman,
1595   Who, in my moode, I stab'd vnto the heart.
1596   <S 1.{Out}.> And I, for such like petty crimes as these.
1597   But to the purpose: for we cite our faults,
1598   That they may hold excus'd our lawlesse liues;
1599   And partly seeing you are beautifide
1600   With goodly shape; and by your owne report,
1601   A Linguist, and a man of such perfection,
1602   As we doe in our quality much want.
1603   <S 2.{Out}.> Indeede because you are a banish'd man,
1604   Therefore, aboue the rest, we parley to you:
1605   Are you content to be our Generall?
1606   To make a vertue of necessity,
1607   And liue as we doe in this wildernesse?
1608  *<S 3.{Out}.> What saist thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
1609   Say #I, and be the captaine of vs all:
1610   #We'll doe thee homage, and be rul'd by thee,
1611   Loue thee, as our Commander, and our King.
      <P C5>
1612   <S 1.{Out}.> But if thou scorne our curtesie, thou dyest.
1613  *<S 2.{Out}.> Thou shalt not liue, to brag what we haue of-|(fer'd.
1614   <S {Val}.> I take your offer, and will liue with you,
1615   Prouided that you do no outrages
1616   On silly women, or poore passengers.
1617   <S 3.{Out}.> No, we detest such vile base practises.
1618   Come, goe with vs, #we'll bring thee to our Crewes,
1619   And show thee all the Treasure we haue got;
1620   Which, with our selues, all rest at thy dispose.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1621   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1622   <D {Enter Protheus, Thurio, Iulia, Host, Musitian, Siluia}.>
1623   <S {Pro}.> Already haue I bin false to {Valentine},
1624   And now I must be as vniust to {Thurio},
1625   Vnder the colour of commending him,
1626   I haue accesse my owne loue to prefer.
1627   But {Siluia} is too faire, too true, too holy,
1628   To be corrupted with my worthlesse guifts;
1629   When I protest true loyalty to her,
1630   She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
1631   When to her beauty I commend my vowes,
1632   She bids me thinke how I haue bin forsworne
1633   In breaking faith with {Iulia}, whom I lou'd;
1634   And notwithstanding all her sodaine quips,
1635   The least whereof would quell a louers hope:
1636   Yet (Spaniel- like) the more she spurnes my loue,
1637   The more it growes, and fawneth on her still;
1638   But here comes {Thurio}; now must we to her window,
1639   And giue some euening Musique to her eare.
1640   <S {Th}.> How now, sir {Protheus}, are you crept before vs?
1641   <S {Pro}.> #I gentle {Thurio}, for you know that loue
1642   Will creepe in seruice, where it cannot goe.
1643   <S {Th}.> #I, but I hope, Sir, that you loue not here.
1644   <S {Pro}.> Sir, but I doe: or else I would be hence.
1645   <S {Th}.> Who, {Siluia}?
1646   <S {Pro}.> #I, {Siluia}, for your sake.
1647  *<S {Th}.> I thanke you for your owne: Now Gentlemen
1648   Let's tune: and #too it lustily #a while.
1649  *<S {Ho}.> Now, my yong guest; me thinks #your' allycholly;
1650   I pray you why is it?
1651   <S {Iu}.> Marry (mine {Host}) because I cannot be merry.
1652  *<S {Ho}.> Come, #we'll haue you merry: ile bring you where
1653  *you shall heare Musique, and see the Gentleman that
1654   you ask'd for.
1655   <S {Iu}.> But shall I heare him speake.
1656   <S {Ho}.> #I that you shall.
1657   <S {Iu}.> That will be Musique.
1658   <S {Ho}.> Harke, harke.
1659   <S {Iu}.> Is he among these?
1660   <S {Ho}.> #I: but peace, let's heare'm.
1661   <S {Song}.> {Who is Siluia? what is she?}
1662   {That all our Swaines commend her?}
1663   {Holy, faire, and wise is she},
1664   {The heauen such grace did lend her},
1665   {that she might admired be}.
1666   {Is she kinde as she is faire?}
1667   {For beauty liues with kindnesse:}
1668   {Loue doth to her eyes repaire},
1669   {To helpe him of his blindnesse:}
1670   {And being help'd, inhabits there}.
1671   {Then to Siluia, let vs sing},
1672   {That Siluia is excelling};
1673   {She excels each mortall thing}
1674   {Vpon the dull earth dwelling}.
1675   {To her let vs Garlands bring}.
1676  *<S {Ho}.> How now? are you sadder then you were before;
1677   How doe you, man? the Musicke likes you not.
1678   <S {Iu}.> You mistake: the Musitian likes me not.
1679   <S {Ho}.> Why, my pretty youth?
1680   <S {Iu}.> He plaies false (father.)
1681   <S {Ho}.> How, out of tune on the strings.
1682   <S {Iu}.> Not so: but yet
1683   So false that he grieues my very heart- strings.
1684   <S {Ho}.> You haue a quicke eare.
1685  *<S {Iu}.> #I, I would I were deafe: it makes me haue a slow |(heart.
1686   <S {Ho}.> I perceiue you delight not in Musique.
1687   <S {Iu}.> Not a whit, when it iars so.
1688   <S {Ho}.> Harke, what fine change is in the Musique.
1689   <S {Iu}.> #I: that change is the spight.
1690  *<S {Ho}.> You would haue them alwaies play but one thing.
1691   <S {Iu}.> I would alwaies haue one play but one thing.
1692   But Host, doth this Sir {Protheus}, that we talke on,
1693   Often resort vnto this Gentlewoman?
1694   <S {Ho}.> I tell you what {Launce} his man told me,
1695   He lou'd her out of all nicke.
1696   <S {Iu}.> Where is {Launce}?
1697  *<S {Ho}.> Gone to seeke his dog, which to morrow, by his
1698  *Masters command, hee must carry for a present to his
1699   Lady.
1700   <S {Iu}.> Peace, stand aside, the company parts.
1701   <S {Pro}.> Sir {Thurio}, feare not you, I will so pleade,
1702   That you shall say, my cunning drift excels.
1703   <S {Th}.> Where meete we?
1704   <S {Pro}.> At Saint {Gregories} #well.
1705   <S {Th}.> Farewell.
1706   <S {Pro}.> Madam: good eu'n to your Ladiship.
1707   <S {Sil}.> I thanke you for your Musique (Gentlemen)
1708   Who is that that spake?
1709   <S {Pro}.> One (Lady) if you knew his pure hearts truth,
1710   You would quickly learne to know him by his voice.
1711   <S {Sil}.> Sir {Protheus}, as I take it.
1712   <S {Pro}.> Sir {Protheus} (gentle Lady) and your Seruant.
1713   <S {Sil}.> What's your #will?
1714   <S {Pro}.> That I may compasse yours.
1715   <S {Sil}.> You haue your wish: my #will is euen this,
1716   That presently you hie you home to bed:
1717   Thou subtile, periur'd, false, disloyall man:
1718   Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitlesse,
1719   To be seduced by thy flattery,
1720   That has't deceiu'd so many with thy vowes?
1721   Returne, returne, and make thy loue amends:
1722   For me (by this pale queene of night I sweare)
1723   I am so farre from granting thy request,
1724   That I despise thee, for thy wrongfull suite;
1725   And #by and by intend to chide my selfe,
1726   Euen for this time I spend in talking to thee.
1727   <S {Pro}.> I grant (sweet loue) that I did loue a Lady,
1728   But she is dead.
1729   <S {Iu}.> 'Twere false, if I should speake it;
1730   For I am sure she is not buried.
1731   <S {Sil}.> Say that she be: yet {Valentine} thy friend
1732   Suruiues; to whom (thy selfe art witnesse)
1733   I am betroth'd; and art thou not asham'd
1734   To wrong him, with thy importunacy?
      <P C5v>
1735   <S {Pro}.> I likewise heare that {Valentine} is dead.
1736   <S {Sil}.> And so suppose am I; for in her graue
1737   Assure thy selfe, my loue is buried.
1738   <S {Pro}.> Sweet Lady, let me rake it from the earth.
1739   <S {Sil}.> Goe to thy Ladies graue and call hers thence,
1740   Or at the least, in hers, sepulcher thine.
1741   <S {Iul}.> He heard not that.
1742   <S {Pro}.> Madam: if your heart be so obdurate:
1743   Vouchsafe me yet your Picture for my loue,
1744   The Picture that is hanging in your chamber:
1745   To that ile speake, to that ile sigh and weepe:
1746   For since the substance of your perfect selfe
1747   Is else deuoted, I am but a shadow;
1748   And to your shadow, will I make true loue.
1749  *<S {Iul}.> If 'twere a substance you would sure deceiue it,
1750   And make it but a shadow, as I am.
1751   <S {Sil}.> I am very loath to be your Idoll Sir;
1752   But, since your falsehood shall become you well
1753   To worship shadowes, and adore false shapes,
1754   Send to me in the morning, and ile send it:
1755   And so, good rest.
1756   <S {Pro}.> As wretches haue ore- night
1757   That wait for execution in the morne.
1758   <S {Iul}.> {Host}, will you goe?
1759   <S {Ho}.> By my hallidome, I was fast asleepe.
1760   <S {Iul}.> Pray you, where lies Sir {Protheus}?
1761   <S {Ho}.> Marry, at my house:
1762   Trust me, I thinke 'tis almost day.
1763   <S {Iul}.> Not so: but it hath bin the longest night
1764   That ere I watch'd, and the most heauiest.
1765   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
1766   <D {Enter Eglamore, Siluia}.>
1767   <S {Eg}.> This is the houre that Madam {Siluia}
1768   Entreated me to call, and know her minde:
1769   Ther's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
1770   Madam, Madam.
1771   <S {Sil}.> Who cals?
1772   <S {Eg}.> Your seruant, and your friend;
1773   One that attends your Ladiships command.
1774   <S {Sil}.> Sir {Eglamore}, a thousand times good morrow.
1775   <S {Eg}.> As many (worthy Lady) to your selfe:
1776   According to your Ladiships impose,
1777   I am thus early come, to know what seruice
1778   It is your pleasure to command me in.
1779   <S {Sil}.> Oh {Eglamoure}, thou art a Gentleman:
1780   Thinke not I flatter (for I sweare I doe not)
1781   Valiant, wise, remorse- full, well accomplish'd.
1782   Thou art not ignorant what deere good #will
1783   I beare vnto the banish'd {Valentine}:
1784   Nor how my father would enforce me marry
1785   Vaine {Thurio} (whom my very soule abhor'd.)
1786   Thy selfe hast lou'd, and I haue heard thee say
1787   No griefe did euer come so neere thy heart,
1788   As when thy Lady, and thy true- loue dide,
1789   Vpon whose Graue thou vow'dst pure chastitie:
1790   Sir {Eglamoure}: I would to {Valentine}
1791   To {Mantua}, where I heare, he makes aboad;
1792   And for the waies are dangerous to passe,
1793   I doe desire thy worthy company,
1794   Vpon whose faith and honor, I repose.
1795   Vrge not my fathers anger ({Eglamoure})
1796   But thinke vpon my griefe (a Ladies griefe)
1797   And on the iustice of my flying hence,
1798   To keepe me from a most vnholy match,
1799   Which heauen and fortune still rewards with plagues.
1800   I doe desire thee, euen from a heart
1801   As full of sorrowes, as the Sea of sands,
1802   To beare me company, and goe with me:
1803   If not, to hide what I haue said to thee,
1804   That I may venture to depart alone.
1805   <S {Egl}.> Madam, I pitty much your grieuances,
1806   Which, since I know they vertuously are plac'd,
1807   I giue consent to goe along with you,
1808   Wreaking as little what betideth me,
1809   As much, I wish all good befortune you.
1810   When will you goe?
1811   <S {Sil}.> This euening comming.
1812   <S {Eg}.> Where shall I meete you?
1813   <S {Sil}.> At {Frier Patrickes} Cell,
1814   Where I intend holy Confession.
1815   <S {Eg}.> I will not faile your Ladiship:
1816   Good morrow (gentle Lady.)
1817   <S {Sil}.> Good morrow, kinde Sir {Eglamoure}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1818   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1819   <D {Enter Launce, Protheus, Iulia, Siluia}.>
1820  *<S {Lau}.> When a mans seruant shall play the Curre with
1821  *him (looke you) it goes hard: one that I brought vp of
1822  *a puppy: one that I sau'd from drowning, when three or
1823  *foure of his blinde brothers and sisters went to it: I haue
1824  *taught him (euen as one would say precisely, thus I
1825  *would teach a dog) I was sent to deliuer him, as a pre-sent
1826  *to Mistris {Siluia}, from my Master; and I came no
1827  *sooner into the dyning- chamber, but he steps me to her
1828  *Trencher, and steales her Capons- leg: O, 'tis a foule
1829  *thing, when a Cur cannot keepe himselfe in all compa-nies:
1830  *I would haue (as one should say) one that takes vp-on
1831  *him to be a dog indeede, to be, as it were, a dog at all
1832  *things. If I had not had more wit then he, to take a fault
1833  *vpon me that he did, I thinke verily hee had bin hang'd
1834  *for't: sure as I liue he had suffer'd for't: you shall iudge:
1835  *Hee thrusts me himselfe into the company of three or
1836  *foure gentleman- like- dogs, vnder the Dukes table: hee
1837  *had not bin there (blesse the marke) a pissing while, but
1838  *all the chamber smelt him: out with the dog (saies one)
1839  *what cur is that (saies another) whip him out (saies the
1840  *third) hang him vp (saies the Duke.) I hauing bin ac-quainted
1841  *with the smell before, knew it was Crab; and
1842  *goes me to the fellow that whips the dogges: friend
1843  *(quoth I) you meane to whip the dog: #I marry doe I
1844  *(quoth he) you doe him the more wrong (quoth I) 'twas
1845  *I did the thing you wot of: he makes me no more adoe,
1846  *but whips me out of the chamber: how many Masters
1847  *would doe this for his Seruant? nay, ile be sworne I haue
1848  *sat in the stockes, for puddings he hath stolne, otherwise
1849  *he had bin executed: I haue stood on the Pillorie for
1850  *Geese he hath kil'd, otherwise he had sufferd for't: thou
1851  *think'st not of this now: nay, I remember the tricke you
1852  *seru'd me, when I tooke my leaue of Madam {Siluia}: did
      <P C6>
1853  *not I bid thee still marke me, and doe as I do; when did'st
1854  *thou see me heaue vp my leg, and make water against a
1855  *Gentlewomans farthingale? did'st thou euer see me doe
1856   such a tricke?
1857   <S {Pro}.> {Sebastian} is thy name: I like thee well,
1858   And will imploy thee in some seruice presently.
1859   <S {Iu}.> In what you please, ile doe what I can.
1860   <S {Pro}.> I hope thou wilt.
1861   How now you whor-son pezant,
1862   Where haue you bin these two dayes loytering?
1863  *<S {La}.> Marry Sir, I carried Mistris {Siluia} the dogge you
1864   bad me.
1865   <S {Pro}.> And what saies she to my little Iewell?
1866  *<S {La}.> Marry she saies your dog was a cur, and tels you
1867   currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
1868   <S {Pro}.> But she receiu'd my dog?
1869   <S {La}.> No indeede did she not:
1870   Here haue I brought him backe againe.
1871   <S {Pro}.> What, didst thou offer her this from me?
1872   <S {La}.> #I Sir, the other Squirrill was stolne from me
1873   By the Hangmans boyes in the market place,
1874   And then I offer'd her mine owne, who is a dog
1875  *As big as ten of yours, & therefore the guift the greater.
1876   <S {Pro}.> Goe, get thee hence, and finde my dog againe,
1877   Or nere returne againe into my sight.
1878   Away, I say: stayest thou to vexe me here;
1879   A Slaue, that still #an end, turnes me to shame:
1880   {Sebastian}, I haue entertained thee,
1881   Partly that I haue neede of such a youth,
1882   That can with some discretion doe my businesse:
1883   For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish Lowt;
1884   But chiefely, for thy face, and thy behauiour,
1885   Which (if my Augury deceiue me not)
1886   Witnesse good bringing vp, fortune, and truth:
1887   Therefore know thee, for this I entertaine thee.
1888   Go presently, and take this Ring with thee,
1889   Deliuer it to Madam {Siluia};
1890   She lou'd me well, deliuer'd it to me.
1891  *<S {Iul}.> It seemes you lou'd not her, not leaue her token:
1892   She is dead belike?
1893   <S {Pro}.> Not so: I thinke she liues.
1894   <S {Iul}.> Alas.
1895   <S {Pro}.> Why do'st thou cry alas?
1896   <S {Iul}.> I cannot choose but pitty her.
1897   <S {Pro}.> Wherefore should'st thou pitty her?
1898   <S {Iul}.> Because, me thinkes that she lou'd you as well
1899   As you doe loue your Lady {Siluia}:
1900   She dreames on him, that has forgot her loue,
1901   You doate on her, that cares not for your loue.
1902   'Tis pitty Loue, should be so contrary:
1903   And thinking on it, makes me cry alas.
1904   <S {Pro}.> Well: giue her that Ring, and therewithall
1905   This Letter: that's her chamber: Tell my Lady,
1906   I claime the promise for her heauenly Picture:
1907   Your message done, hye home vnto my chamber,
1908   Where thou shalt finde me sad, and solitarie.
1909   <S {Iul}.> How many women would doe such a message?
1910   Alas poore {Protheus}, thou hast entertain'd
1911   A Foxe, to be the Shepheard of thy Lambs;
1912   Alas, poore foole, why doe I pitty him
1913   That with his very heart despiseth me?
1914   Because he loues her, he despiseth me,
1915   Because I loue him, I must pitty him.
1916   This Ring I gaue him, when he parted from me,
1917   To binde him to remember my good #will:
1918   And now am I (vnhappy Messenger)
1919   To plead for that, which I would not obtaine;
1920   To carry that, which I would haue refus'd;
1921   To praise his faith, which I would haue disprais'd.
1922   I am my Masters true confirmed Loue,
1923   But cannot be true seruant to my Master,
1924   Vnlesse I proue false traitor to my selfe.
1925   Yet will I woe for him, but yet so coldly,
1926   As (heauen it knowes) I would not haue him speed.
1927   Gentlewoman, good day: I pray you be my meane
1928   To bring me where to speake with Madam {Siluia}.
1929   <S {Sil}.> What would you with her, if that I be she?
1930   <S {Iul}.> If you be she, I doe intreat your patience
1931   To heare me speake the message I am sent on.
1932   <S {Sil}.> From whom?
1933   <S {Iul}.> From my Master, Sir {Protheus}, Madam.
1934   <S {Sil}.> Oh: he sends you for a Picture?
1935   <S {Iul}.> #I, Madam.
1936   <S {Sil}.> {Vrsula}, bring my Picture there,
1937   Goe, giue your Master this: tell him from me,
1938   One {Iulia}, that his changing thoughts forget
1939   Would better fit his Chamber, then this Shadow.
1940   <S {Iul}.> Madam, please you peruse this Letter;
1941   Pardon me (Madam) I haue vnaduis'd
1942   Deliuer'd you a paper that I should not;
1943   This is the Letter to your Ladiship.
1944   <S {Sil}.> I pray thee let me looke on that againe.
1945   <S {Iul}.> It may not be: good Madam pardon me.
1946   <S {Sil}.> There, hold:
1947   I will not looke vpon your Masters lines:
1948   I know they are stuft with protestations,
1949   And full of new- found oathes, which he will breake
1950   As easily, as I doe teare his paper.
1951   <S {Iul}.> Madam, he sends your Ladiship this Ring.
1952   <S {Sil}.> The more shame for him, that he sends it me;
1953   For I haue heard him say a thousand times,
1954   His {Iulia} gaue it him, at his departure:
1955   Though his false finger haue prophan'd the Ring,
1956   Mine shall not doe his {Iulia} so much wrong.
1957   <S {Iul}.> She thankes you.
1958   <S {Sil}.> What sai'st thou?
1959   <S {Iul}.> I thanke you Madam, that you tender her:
1960   Poore Gentlewoman, my Master wrongs her much.
1961   <S {Sil}.> Do'st thou know her?
1962   <S {Iul}.> Almost as well as I doe know my selfe.
1963   To  thinke vpon her woes, I doe protest
1964   That I haue wept a hundred seuerall times.
1965  *<S {Sil}.> Belike she thinks that {Protheus} hath forsook her?
1966  *<S {Iul}.> I thinke she doth: and that's her cause of sorrow.
1967   <S {Sil}.> Is she not passing faire?
1968   <S {Iul}.> She hath bin fairer (Madam) then she is,
1969   When she did thinke my Master lou'd her well;
1970   She, in my iudgement, was as faire as you.
1971   But since she did neglect her looking- glasse,
1972   And threw her Sun- expelling Masque away,
1973   The ayre hath staru'd the roses in her cheekes,
1974   And pinch'd the lilly- tincture of her face,
1975   That now she is become as blacke as I.
1976   <S {Sil}.> How tall was she?
1977   <S {Iul}.> About my stature: for at {Pentecost},
1978   When all our Pageants of delight were plaid,
1979   Our youth got me to play the womans part,
1980   And I was trim'd in Madam {Iulias} gowne,
1981   Which serued me as fit, by all mens iudgements,
1982   As if the garment had bin made for me:
1983   Therefore I know she is about my height,
1984   And at that time I made her weepe #a good,
      <P C6v>
1985   For I did play a lamentable part.
1986   (Madam) 'twas {Ariadne}, passioning
1987   For {Thesus} periury, and vniust flight;
1988   Which I so liuely acted with my teares:
1989   That my poore Mistris moued therewithall,
1990   Wept bitterly: and would I might be dead,
1991   If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.
1992   <S {Sil}.> She is beholding to thee (gentle youth)
1993   Alas (poore Lady) desolate, and left;
1994   I weepe my selfe to thinke vpon thy words:
1995   Here youth: there is my purse; I giue thee this
1996  *For thy sweet Mistris sake, because thou lou'st her. Fare-|(well.
1997  *<S {Iul}.> And she shall thanke you for't, if ere you know |(her.
1998   A vertuous gentlewoman, milde, and beautifull.
1999   I hope my Masters suit will be but cold,
2000   Since she respects my Mistris loue so much.
2001   Alas, how loue can trifle with it selfe:
2002   Here is her Picture: let me see, I thinke
2003   If I had such a Tyre, this face of mine
2004   Were full as louely, as is this of hers;
2005   And yet the Painter flatter'd her a little,
2006   Vnlesse I flatter with my selfe too much.
2007   Her haire is {Aburne}, mine is perfect {Yellow};
2008   If that be all the difference in his loue,
2009   Ile get me such a coulour'd Perrywig:
2010   Her eyes are grey as glasse, and so are mine.
2011   #I, but her fore- head's low, and mine's as high:
2012   What should it be that he respects in her,
2013   But I can make respectiue in my selfe?
2014   If this fond Loue, were not a blinded god.
2015   Come shadow, come, and take this shadow vp,
2016   For 'tis thy riuall: O thou sencelesse forme,
2017   Thou shalt be worship'd, kiss'd, lou'd, and ador'd;
2018   And were there sence in his Idolatry,
2019   My substance should be statue in thy stead.
2020   Ile vse thee kindly, for thy Mistris sake
2021   That vs'd me so: or else by {Ioue}, I vow,
2022   I should haue scratch'd out your vnseeing eyes,
2023   To make my Master out of loue with thee.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2024   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima}.>
2025   <D {Enter Eglamoure, Siluia}.>
2026   <S {Egl}.> The Sun begins to guild the westerne skie,
2027   And now it is about the very houre
2028   That {Siluia}, at Fryer {Patricks} Cell should meet me,
2029   She will not faile; for Louers breake not houres,
2030   Vnlesse it be to come before their time,
2031   So much they spur their expedition.
2032   See where she comes: Lady a happy euening.
2033   <S {Sil}.> Amen, Amen: goe on (good {Eglamoure})
2034   Out at the Posterne by the Abbey wall;
2035   I feare I am attended by some Spies.
2036   <S {Egl}.> Feare not: the Forrest is not three leagues off,
2037   If we recouer that, we are sure enough.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2038   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
2039   <D {Enter Thurio, Protheus, Iulia, Duke}.>
2040   <S {Th}.> Sir {Protheus}, what saies {Siluia} to my suit?
2041   <S {Pro}.> Oh Sir, I finde her milder then she was,
2042   And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
2043   <S {Thu}.> What? that my leg is too long?
2044   <S {Pro}.> No, that it is too little.
2045  *<S {Thu}.> Ile weare a Boote, to make it somewhat roun-|(der.
2046   <S {Pro}.> But loue will not be spurd to what it loathes.
2047   <S {Thu}.> What saies she to my face?
2048   <S {Pro}.> She saies it is a faire one.
2049   <S {Thu}.> Nay then the wanton lyes: my face is blacke.
2050   <S {Pro}.> But Pearles are faire; and the old saying is,
2051   Blacke men are Pearles, in beauteous Ladies eyes.
2052   <S {Thu}.> 'Tis true, such Pearles as put out Ladies eyes,
2053   For I had rather winke, then looke on them.
2054   <S {Thu}.> How likes she my discourse?
2055   <S {Pro}.> #Ill, when you talke of war.
2056   <S {Thu}.> But well, when I discourse of loue and peace.
2057   <S {Iul}.> But better indeede, when you hold you peace.
2058   <S {Thu}.> What sayes she to my valour?
2059   <S {Pro}.> Oh Sir, she makes no doubt of that.
2060  *<S {Iul}.> She needes not, when she knowes it cowardize.
2061   <S {Thu}.> What saies she to my birth?
2062   <S {Pro}.> That you are well deriu'd.
2063   <S {Iul}.> True: from a Gentleman, to a foole.
2064   <S {Thu}.> Considers she my Possessions?
2065   <S {Pro}.> Oh, #I: and pitties them.
2066   <S {Thu}.> Wherefore?
2067   <S {Iul}.> That such an Asse should owe them.
2068   <S {Pro}.> That they are out by Lease.
2069   <S {Iul}.> Here comes the Duke.
2070   <S {Du}.> How now sir {Protheus}; how now {Thurio}?
2071   Which of you saw {Eglamoure} of late?
2072   <S {Thu}.> Not I.
2073   <S {Pro}.> Nor I.
2074   <S {Du}.> Saw you my daughter?
2075   <S {Pro}.> Neither.
2076   <S {Du}.> Why then
2077   She's fled vnto that pezant, {Valentine};
2078   And {Eglamoure} is in her Company:
2079   'Tis true: for Frier {Laurence} met them both
2080   As he, in pennance wander'd through the Forrest:
2081   Him he knew well: and guesd that it was she,
2082   But being mask'd, he was not sure of it.
2083   Besides she did intend Confession
2084   At {Patricks} Cell this euen, and there she was not.
2085   These likelihoods confirme her flight from hence;
2086   Therefore I pray you stand, not to discourse,
2087   But mount you presently, and meete with me
2088   Vpon the rising of the Mountaine foote
2089   That leads toward {Mantua}, whether they are fled:
2090   Dispatch (sweet Gentlemen) and follow me.
2091   <S {Thu}.> Why this it is, to be a peeuish Girle,
2092   That flies her fortune when it followes her:
2093   Ile after; more to be reueng'd on {Eglamoure},
2094   Then for the loue of reck- lesse {Siluia}.
2095   <S {Pro}.> And I will follow, more for {Siluias} loue
2096   Then hate of {Eglamoure} that goes with her.
2097   <S {Iul}.> And I will follow, more to crosse that loue
2098   Then hate for {Siluia}, that is gone for loue.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2099   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2100   <D {Siluia, Out-lawes}.>
2101   <S 1.{Out}.> Come, come be patient:
      <P D1><C C>
2102   We must bring you to our Captaine.
2103   <S {Sil}.> A thousand more mischances then this one
2104   Haue learn'd me how to brooke this patiently.
2105   <S 2 {Out}.> Come, bring her away.
2106   <S 1 {Out}.> Where is the Gentleman that was with her?
2107   <S 3 {Out}.> Being nimble footed, he hath out- run vs.
2108   But {Moyses} and {Valerius} follow him:
2109   Goe thou with her to the West end of the wood,
2110   There is our Captaine: Wee'll follow him that's fled,
2111   The Thicket is beset, he cannot scape.
2112  *<S 1 {Out}.> Come, I must bring you to our Captains caue.
2113   Feare not: he beares an honourable minde,
2114   And will not vse a woman lawlesly.
2115   <S {Sil}.> O {Valentine}: this I endure for thee.
2116   <D {Exeunt}.>
2117   <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
2118  *<D {Enter Valentine, Protheus, Siluia, Iulia, Duke, Thurio},
2119   {Out-lawes}.>
2120   <S {Val}.> How vse doth breed a habit in a man?
2121   This shadowy desart, vnfrequented woods
2122   I better brooke then flourishing peopled Townes:
2123   Here can I sit alone, vn- seene of any,
2124   And to the Nightingales complaining Notes
2125   Tune my distresses, and record my woes.
2126   O thou that dost inhabit in my brest,
2127   Leaue not the Mansion so long Tenant- lesse,
2128   Lest growing ruinous, the building fall,
2129   And leaue no memory of what it was,
2130   Repaire me, with thy presence, {Siluia}:
2131   Thou gentle Nimph, cherish thy for-lorne swaine.
2132   What hallowing, and what stir is this to day?
2133   These are my mates, that make their wills their Law,
2134   Haue some vnhappy passenger in chace;
2135   They loue me well: yet I haue much to doe
2136   To keepe them from vnciuill outrages.
2137   Withdraw thee {Valentine}: who's this comes heere?
2138   <S {Pro}.> Madam, this seruice I haue done for you
2139   (Though you respect not aught your seruant doth)
2140   To hazard life, and reskew you from him,
2141   That would haue forc'd your honour, and your loue,
2142   Vouchsafe me for my meed, but one faire looke:
2143   (A smaller boone then this I cannot beg,
2144   And lesse then this, I am sure you cannot giue.)
2145   <S {Val}.> How like a dreame is this? I see, and heare:
2146   Loue, lend me patience to forbeare #a while.
2147   <S {Sil}.> O miserable, vnhappy that I am.
2148   <S {Pro}.> Vnhappy were you (Madam) ere I came:
2149   But by my comming, I haue made you happy.
2150  *<S {Sil}.> By thy approach thou mak'st me most vnhappy.
2151  *<S {Iul}.> And me, when he approcheth to your presence.
2152   <S {Sil}.> Had I beene ceazed by a hungry Lion,
2153   I would haue beene a break-fast to the Beast,
2154   Rather then haue false {Protheus} reskue  me:
2155   Oh heauen be iudge how I loue {Valentine},
2156   Whose life's as tender to me as my soule,
2157   And full as much (for more there cannot be)
2158   I doe detest false periur'd {Protheus}:
2159   Therefore be gone, sollicit me no more.
2160  *<S {Pro}.> What dangerous action, stood it next to death
2161   Would I not vndergoe, for one calme looke:
2162   Oh 'tis the curse in Loue, and still approu'd
2163   When women cannot loue, where they're belou'd.
2164  *<S {Sil}.> When {Protheus} cannot loue, where he's belou'd:
2165   Read ouer {Iulia's} heart, (thy first best Loue)
2166   For whose deare sake, thou didst then rend thy faith
2167   Into a thousand oathes; and all those oathes,
2168   Descended into periury, to loue me,
2169   Thou hast no faith left now, vnlesse thou'dst two,
2170   And that's farre worse then none: better haue none
2171   Then plurall faith, which is too much by one:
2172   Thou Counterfeyt, to thy true friend.
2173   <S {Pro}.> In Loue,
2174   Who respects friend?
2175   <S {Sil}.> All men but {Protheus}.
2176   <S {Pro}.> Nay, if the gentle spirit of mouing words
2177   Can no way change you to a milder forme;
2178   Ile wooe you like a Souldier, at armes end,
2179   And loue you 'gainst the nature of Loue: force ye.
2180   <S {Sil}.> Oh heauen.
2181   <S {Pro}.> Ile force thee yeeld to my desire.
2182   <S {Val}.> Ruffian: let goe that rude vnciuill touch,
2183   Thou friend of an #ill fashion.
2184   <S {Pro}.> {Valentine}.
2185  *<S {Val}.> Thou co[m]mon friend, that's without faith or loue,
2186   For such is a friend now: treacherous man,
2187   Thou hast beguil'd my hopes; nought but mine eye
2188   Could haue perswaded me: now I dare not say
2189   I haue one friend aliue; thou wouldst disproue me:
2190   Who should be trusted, when ones right hand
2191   Is periured to the bosome? {Protheus}
2192   I am sorry I must neuer trust thee more,
2193   But count the world a stranger for thy sake:
2194   The priuate wound is deepest: oh time, most accurst.
2195   'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst?
2196   <S {Pro}.> My shame and guilt confounds me:
2197   Forgiue me {Valentine}: if hearty sorrow
2198   Be a sufficient Ransome for offence,
2199   I tender't heere: I doe as truely suffer,
2200   As ere I did commit.
2201   <S {Val}.> Then I am paid:
2202   And once againe, I doe receiue thee honest;
2203   Who by Repentance is not satisfied,
2204   Is nor of heauen, nor earth; for these are pleas'd:
2205   By Penitence th' Eternalls wrath's appeas'd:
2206   And that my loue may appeare plaine and free,
2207   All that was mine, in {Siluia}, I giue thee.
2208   <S {Iul}.> Oh me vnhappy.
2209   <S {Pro}.> Looke to the Boy.
2210   <S {Val}.> Why, Boy?
2211  *Why wag: how now? what's the matter? look vp: speak.
2212  *<S {Iul}.> O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliuer a ring
2213  *to Madam {Siluia}: w (out of my neglect) was neuer done.
2214   <S {Pro}.> Where is that ring? boy?
2215   <S {Iul}.> Heere 'tis: this is it.
2216   <S {Pro}.> How? let me see.
2217   Why this is the ring I gaue to {Iulia}.
2218   <S {Iul}.> Oh, cry you mercy sir, I haue mistooke:
2219   This is the ring you sent to {Siluia}.
2220  *<S {Pro}.> But how cam'st thou by this ring? at my depart
2221   I gaue this vnto {Iulia}.
2222   <S {Iul}.> And {Iulia} her selfe did giue it me,
2223   And {Iulia} her selfe hath brought it hither.
2224   <S {Pro}.> How? {Iulia}?
2225   <S {Iul}.> Behold her, that gaue ayme to all thy oathes,
2226   And entertain'd 'em deepely in her heart.
2227   How oft hast thou with periury cleft the roote?
2228   Oh {Protheus}, let this habit make thee blush.
      <P D1v>
2229   Be thou asham'd that I haue tooke vpon me,
2230   Such an immodest rayment; if shame liue
2231   In a disguise of loue?
2232   It is the lesser blot modesty findes,
2233   Women to change their shapes, then men their minds.
2234  *<S {Pro}.> Then men their minds? tis true: oh heuen, were man
2235   But Constant, he were perfect; that one error
2236  *Fils him with faults: makes him run through all th' sins;
2237   Inconstancy falls- off, ere it begins:
2238   What is in {Siluia's} face, but I may spie
2239   More fresh in {Iulia's}, with a constant eye?
2240   <S {Val}.> Come, come: a hand from either:
2241   Let me be blest to make this happy close:
2242   'Twere pitty two such friends should be long foes.
2243  *<S {Pro}.> Beare witnes (heauen) I haue my wish for euer.
2244   <S {Iul}.> And I mine.
2245   <S {Out-l}.> A prize: a prize: a prize.
2246  *<S {Val}.> Forbeare, forbeare I say: It is my Lord the {Duke}.
2247   Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd,
2248   Banished {Valentine}.
2249   <S {Duke}.> Sir {Valentine}?
2250   <S {Thu}.> Yonder is {Siluia}: and {Siluia}'s mine.
2251   <S {Val}.> {Thurio} giue backe; or else embrace thy death:
2252   Come not within the measure of my wrath:
2253   Doe not name {Siluia} thine: if once againe,
2254   {Verona} shall not hold thee: heere she stands,
2255   Take but possession of her, with a Touch:
2256   I dare thee, but to breath vpon my Loue.
2257   <S {Thur}.> Sir {Valentine}, I care not for her, I:
2258   I hold him but a foole that will endanger
2259   His Body, for a Girle that loues him not:
2260   I claime her not, and therefore she is thine.
2261   <S {Duke}.> The more degenerate and base art thou
2262   To make such meanes for her, as thou hast done,
2263   And leaue her on such slight conditions.
2264   Now, by the honor of my Ancestry,
2265   I doe applaud thy spirit, {Valentine},
2266   And thinke thee worthy of an Empresse loue:
2267   Know then, I heere forget all former greefes,
2268   Cancell all grudge, repeale thee home againe,
2269   Plead a new state in thy vn- riual'd merit,
2270   To which I thus subscribe: Sir {Valentine},
2271   Thou art a Gentleman, and well deriu'd,
2272   Take thou thy {Siluia}, for thou hast deseru'd her.
2273  *<S {Val}.> I thank your Grace, y gift hath made me happy:
2274   I now beseech you (for your daughters sake)
2275   To grant one Boone that I shall aske of you.
2276   <S {Duke}.> I grant it (for thine owne) what ere it be.
2277   <S {Val}.> These banish'd men, that I haue kept withall,
2278   Are men endu'd with worthy qualities:
2279   Forgiue them what they haue committed here,
2280   And let them be recall'd from their Exile:
2281   They are reformed, ciuill, full of good,
2282   And fit for great employment (worthy Lord.)
2283   <S {Duke}.> Thou hast preuaild, I pardon them and thee:
2284   Dispose of them, as thou knowst their deserts.
2285   Come, let vs goe, we will include all iarres,
2286   With Triumphes, Mirth, and rare solemnity.
2287   <S {Val}.> And as we walke along, I dare be bold
2288   With our discourse, to make your Grace to smile.
2289   What thinke you of this Page (my Lord?)
2290  *<S {Duke}.> I think the Boy hath grace in him, he blushes.
2291  *<S {Val}.> I warrant you (my Lord) more grace, then Boy.
2292   <S {Duke}.> What meane you by that saying?
2293   <S {Val}.> Please you, Ile tell you, as we passe along,
2294   That you will wonder what hath fortuned:
2295   Come {Protheus}, 'tis your pennance, but to heare
2296   The story of your Loues discouered.
2297   That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,
2298   One Feast, one house, one mutuall happinesse.  <D {Exeunt}.>
