2     *<D {Enter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, He-ro}
3     *{his daughter, and Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger}.>
4      <S {Leonato}.>
5     *I learne in this Letter, that {#Don Peter} of {Arra-gon},
6      comes this night to {Messina}.
7     *<S {Mess}.> He is very neere by this: he was not
8      three Leagues off when I left him.
9     *<S {Leon}.> How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this
10     action?
11     <S {Mess}.> But few of any sort, and none of name.
12    *<S {Leon}.> A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
13    *brings home full numbers: I finde heere, that #Don {Pe-ter}
14    *hath bestowed much honor on a yong {Florentine}, cal-led
15     {Claudio}.
16    *<S {Mess}.> Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remem-bred
17    *by #Don {Pedro}, he hath borne himselfe beyond the
18    *promise of his age, doing in the figure of a Lambe, the
19    *feats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred expecta-tion,
20     then you must expect of me to tell you how.
21    *<S {Leo}.> He hath an Vnckle heere in {Messina}, wil be very
22     much glad of it.
23    *<S {Mess}.> I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and there
24    *appeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy could
25    *not shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of bit-ternesse.
26    _
27     <S {Leo}.> Did he breake out into teares?
28     <S {Mess}.> In great measure.
29    *<S {Leo}.> A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no fa-ces
30    *truer, then those that are so wash'd, how much bet-ter
31     is it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?
32    *<S {Bea}.> I pray you, is Signior {Mountanto} return'd from
33     the warres, or no?
34    *<S {Mess}.> I know none of that name, Lady, there was
35     none such in the armie of any sort.
36     <S {Leon}.> What is he that you aske for Neece?
37    *<S {Hero}.> My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of {Padua}
38    *<S {Mess}.> O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he was.
39    *<S {Beat}.> He set vp his bils here in {Messina}, & challeng'd
40    *Cupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading the
41    *Challenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him at
42    *the Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and
43    *eaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for
44     indeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing.
45    *<S {Leon}.> 'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too
46     much, but hee'l be meete with you, I doubt it not.
47    *<S {Mess}.> He hath done good seruice Lady in these wars.
48    *<S {Beat}.> You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to
49    *ease it: he's a very valiant Trencher- man, hee hath an
50     excellent stomacke.
51     <S {Mess}.> And a good souldier too Lady.
52    *<S {Beat}.> And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he
53     to a Lord?
54    *<S {Mess}.> A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with
55     all honourable vertues.
56    *<S {Beat}.> It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:
57     but for the stuffing well, we are all mortall.
58    *<S {Leon}.> You must not (sir) mistake my Neece, there is
59    *a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, & her:
60    *they neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between
61     them.
62    *<S {Bea}.> Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last con-flict,
63    *foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is
64    *the whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue
65    *wit enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it
66    *for a difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it
67    *is all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reaso-nable
68    *creature. Who is his companion now? He hath
69     euery month a new sworne brother.
70     <S {Mess}.> Is't possible?
71    *<S {Beat}.> Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as
72    *the fashion of his hat, it euer changes with y next block.
73    *<S {Mess}.> I see (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your
74     bookes.
75    *<S {Bea}.> No, #and he were, I would burne my study. But
76    *I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young
77    *squarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the
78     diuell?
79    *<S {Mess}.> He is most in the company of the right noble
80     {#Claudio}.
81    *<S {Beat}.> O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:
82    *he is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker
83    *runs presently mad. God helpe the noble {Claudio}, if hee
84    *haue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand
85     pound ere he be cur'd.
86     <S {Mess}.> I will hold friends with you Lady.
87     <S {Bea}.> Do good friend.
88     <S {Leo}.> You'l ne're run mad Neece.
89     <S {Bea}.> No, not till a hot Ianuary.
90     <S {Mess}.> {#Don Pedro} is approach'd.
91     <D {Enter #don Pedro, Claudio, Benedicke, Balthasar},
92     {and Iohn the bastard}.>
93    *<S {Pedro}.> Good Signior {Leonato}, you are come to meet
94    *your trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,
95     and you encounter it.
96    *<S {Leon}.> Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes
97    *of your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
98    *remaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,
99     and happinesse takes his leaue.
      <P I3v><C D>
100   *<S {Pedro}.> You embrace your charge too willingly: I
101    thinke this is your daughter.
102    <S {Leonato}.> Her mother hath many times told me so.
103    <S {Bened}.> Were you in doubt that you askt her?
104   *<S {Leonato}.> Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a
105    childe.
106   *<S {Pedro}.> You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by
107   *this, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers
108   *her selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable
109    father.
110   *<S {Ben}.> If Signior {Leonato} be her father, she would not
111   *haue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like him
112    as she is.
113   *<S {Beat}.> I wonder that you will still be talking, signior
114    Benedicke, no body markes you.
115   *<S {Ben}.> What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet
116    liuing?
117   *<S {Beat}.> Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee
118   *hath such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke?
119   *Curtesie it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in
120    her presence.
121   *<S {Bene}.> Then is curtesie a turne- coate, but it is cer-taine
122   *I am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and
123   *I would I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard
124    heart, for truely I loue none.
125   *<S {Beat}.> A deere happinesse to women, they would else
126   *haue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke
127   *God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that, I
128   *had rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man
129    sweare he loues me.
130   *<S {Bene}.> God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,
131   *so some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
132    scratcht face.
133   *<S {Beat}.> Scratching could not make it worse, #and 'twere
134    such a face as yours were.
135    <S {Bene}.> Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher.
136   *<S {Beat}.> A bird of  my tongue, is better than a beast of
137    #your.
138   *<S {Ben}.> I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
139   *and so good a continuer, but keepe your way #a Gods
140    name, I haue done.
141   *<S {Beat}.> You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know
142    you of old.
143   *<S {Pedro}.> This is the summe of all: {Leonato}, signior {Clau-dio},
144   *and signior {Benedicke}; my deere friend {Leonato}, hath
145   *inuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the least
146   *a moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may de-taine
147   *vs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but
148    praies from his heart.
149   *<S {Leon}.> If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be for-sworne,
150   *let mee bid you welcome, my Lord, being re-conciled
151   *to the Prince your brother: I owe you all
152    duetie.
153   *<S {Iohn}.> I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I
154    thanke you.
155    <S {Leon}.> Please it your grace leade on?
156    <S {Pedro}.> Your hand {Leonato}, we will goe together.
157    <D {Exeunt.  Manet Benedicke and Claudio}.>
158   *<S {Clau}.> {Benedicke}, didst thou note the daughter of sig-nior
159    {Leonato}?
160    <S {Bene}.> I noted her not, but I lookt on her.
161    <S {Claud}.> Is she not a modest yong Ladie?
162   *<S {Bene}.> Doe you question me as an honest man should
163   *doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue
164   *me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant
165    to their sexe?
166    <S {Clau}.> No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement.
167   *<S {Bene}.> Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie
168   *praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a
169   *great praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,
170   *that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
171    and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her.
172   *<S {Clau}.> Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me
173    truely how thou lik'st her.
174   *<S {Bene}.> Would you buie her, that you enquier after
175    her?
176    <S {Clau}.> Can the world buie such a iewell?
177   *<S {Ben}.> Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this
178   *with a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke, to
179   *tell vs Cupid is a good Hare- finder, and Vulcan a rare
180   *Carpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to
181    goe in the song?
182   *<S {Clau}.> In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer
183    I lookt on.
184   *<S {Bene}.> I can see   yet without spectacles, and I see no
185   *such matter: there's her cosin, #and she were not possest
186   *with a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the first
187   *of #Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you haue
188    no intent to turne husband, haue you?
189   *<S {Clau}.> I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had
190    sworne the contrarie, if {Hero} would be my wife.
191   *<S {Bene}.> Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world one
192   *man but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall I ne-uer
193   *see a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,
194   *#and thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare
195   *the print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, {#don Pedro}
196    is returned to seeke you.
197    <D {Enter #don Pedro, Iohn the bastard}.>
198   *<S {Pedr}.> What secret hath held you here, that you fol-lowed
199    not to {Leonatoes}?
200   *<S {Bened}.> I would your Grace would constraine mee to
201    tell.
202    <S {Pedro}.> I charge thee on thy allegeance.
203   *<S {Ben}.> You heare, Count {Claudio}, I can be secret as a
204   *dumbe man, I would haue you thinke so (but on my al-legiance,
205   *marke you this, on my allegiance) hee is in
206   *loue, With who? now that is your Graces part: marke
207   *how short his answere is, with {Hero}, {Leonatoes} short
208    daughter.
209    <S {Clau}.> If this were so, so were it vttred.
210   *<S {Bened}.> Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor 'twas
211    not so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so.
212   *<S {Clau}.> If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
213    should be otherwise.
214   *<S {Pedro}.> Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie
215    well worthie.
216    <S {Clau}.> You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord.
217    <S {Pedr}.> By my troth I speake my thought.
218    <S {Clau}.> And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine.
219   *<S {Bened}.> And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I
220    speake mine.
221    <S {Clau}.> That I loue her, I feele.
222    <S {Pedr}.> That she is worthie, I know.
223   *<S {Bened}.> That I neither feele how shee should be lo-ued,
224   *nor know how shee should be worthie, is the
225   *opinion that fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at
226    the stake.
227   *<S {Pedr}.> Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the de-spight
228    of Beautie.
229   *<S {Clau}.> And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the
230    force of his #will
      <P I4><C C>
231    <S *{Ben}.> That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that
232   *she brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble
233   *thankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my
234   *forehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all
235   *women shall pardon me: because I will not do them the
236   *wrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to
237   *trust none: and the fine is, (for the which I may goe the
238    finer) I will liue a Batchellor.
239   *<S {Pedro}.> I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue.
240   *<S {Bene}.> With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger,
241   *my Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more
242   *blood with loue, then I will get againe with drinking,
243   *picke out mine eyes with a Ballet- makers penne, and
244   *hang me vp at the doore of a brothel- house for the signe
245    of blinde Cupid.
246   *<S {Pedro}.> Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,
247    thou wilt proue a notable argument.
248   *<S {Bene}.> If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, & shoot
249   *at me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the shoul-der,
250    and cal'd {Adam}.
251   *<S {Pedro}.> Well, as time shall trie: In time the sauage
252    Bull doth beare the yoake.
253   *<S {Bene}.> The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible
254   *{Benedicke} beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set
255   *them in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and
256   *in such great Letters as they write, heere is good horse
257   *to hire: let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may
258    see {Benedicke} the married man.
259   *<S {Clau}.> If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee
260    horne mad.
261   *<S {Pedro}.> Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in
262    Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
263    <S {Bene}.> I looke for an earthquake too then.
264   *<S {Pedro}.> Well, you will temporize with the houres, in
265   *the meane time, good Signior {Benedicke}, repaire to {Leo-natoes},
266   *commend me to him, and tell him I will not faile
267   *him at supper, for indeede he hath made great prepara-tion.
268   _
269   *<S {Bene}.> I haue almost matter enough in me for such an
270    Embassage, and so I commit you.
271   *<S {Clau}.> To the tuition of God. From my house, if I
272    had it.
273   *<S {Pedro}.> The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend, {Benedick}.
274   *<S {Bene}.> Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your
275   *discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the
276   *guardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout
277   *old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I
278    leaue you.  <D {Exit}.>
279   *<S {Clau}.> My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee
280    good.
281    <S {Pedro}.> My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,
282    And thou shalt see how apt it is to learne
283    Any hard Lesson that may do thee good.
284    <S {Clau}.> Hath {Leonato} any sonne my Lord?
285    <S {Pedro}.> No childe but {Hero}, she's his onely heire.
286    Dost thou affect her {Claudio}?
287    <S {Clau}.> O my Lord,
288    When you went onward on this ended action,
289    I look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,
290    That lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,
291    Than to driue liking to the name of loue:
292    But now I am return'd, and that warre- thoughts
293    Haue left their places vacant: in their roomes,
294    Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
295    All prompting mee how faire yong {Hero} is,
296    Saying I lik'd her ere I went to warres.
297    <S {Pedro}.> Thou wilt be like a louer presently,
298    And tire the hearer with a booke of words:
299    If thou dost loue faire {Hero}, cherish it,
300    And I will breake with her: #wast not to this end,
301    That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?
302    <S {Clau}.> How sweetly doe you minister to loue,
303    That know loues griefe by his complexion!
304    But lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,
305    I would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise.
306   *<S {Ped}.> What need y bridge much broder then the flood?
307    The fairest graunt is the necessitie:
308    Looke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,
309    And I will fit thee with the remedie,
310    I know we shall haue reuelling to night,
311    I will assume thy part in some disguise,
312    And tell faire {Hero} I am {Claudio},
313    And in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,
314    And take her hearing prisoner with the force
315    And strong incounter of my amorous tale:
316    Then after, to her father will I breake,
317    And the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,
318    In practise let vs put it presently.  <D {Exeunt}.>
319    <D {Enter Leonato and an old man, brother to Leonato}.>
320   *<S {Leo}.> How now brother, where is my cosen your son:
321    hath he prouided this musicke?
322   *<S {Old}.> He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell
323    you newes that you yet dreamt not of.
324    <S {Lo}.> Are they good?
325   *<S {Old}.> As the euents stamps them, but they haue a good
326   *couer: they shew well outward, the Prince and Count
327   *{#Claudio} walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard,
328   *were thus ouer- heard by a man of mine: the Prince dis-couered
329   *to {Claudio} that hee loued my niece your daugh-ter,
330   *and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance,
331   *and if hee found her accordant, hee meant to take the
332   *present time by the top, and instantly breake with you
333    of it.
334    <S {Leo}.> Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
335   *<S {Old}.> A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and
336    question him your selfe.
337   *<S {Leo}.> No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it ap-peare
338   *it selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall,
339   *that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if per-aduenture
340   *this bee true: goe you and tell her of it: coo-sins,
341   *you know what you haue to doe, O I crie you mer-cie
342   *friend, goe you with mee and I will vse your skill,
343    good cosin haue a care this busie time.  <D {Exeunt}.>
344    <D {Enter Sir Iohn the Bastard, and Conrade his companion}.>
345   *<S {Con}.> What the good yeere my Lord, why are you
346    thus out of measure sad?
347   *<S {Ioh}.> There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,
348    therefore the sadnesse is without limit.
349    <S {Con}.> You should heare reason.
350   *<S {Iohn}.> And when I haue heard it, what blessing brin-geth
351    it?
352   *<S {Con}.> If not a present remedy, yet a patient sufferance.
353   *<S {Ioh}.> I wonder that thou (being as thou saist thou art,
354   *borne vnder {Saturne}) goest about to apply a morall me-dicine,
355   *to a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what I
356   *am: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile   at no
357   *mans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no
358   *mans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no
359   *mans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no man
360    in his humor.
361   *<S {Con}.> Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,
362   *till you may doe it without controllment, you haue of
      <P I4v>
363   *late stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane
364   *you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you
365   *should take root, but by the faire weather that you make
366   *your selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your
367    owne haruest.
368   *<S {Iohn}.> I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose
369   *in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd of
370   *all, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this
371   *(though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man)
372   *it must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I
373   *am trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with a clog,
374   *therefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage: if I had
375   *my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do
376   *my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and
377    seeke not to alter me.
378    <S {Con}.> Can you make no vse of your discontent?
379    <S {Iohn}.> I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely.
380    Who comes here? what newes {Borachio}?
381    <D {Enter Borachio}.>
382   *<S {Bor}.> I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince
383   *your brother is royally entertained by {Leonato}, and I can
384    giue you intelligence of an intended marriage.
385   *<S {Iohn}.> Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe
386   *on? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to
387    vnquietnesse?
388    <S {Bor}.> Mary it is your brothers right hand.
389    <S {Iohn}.> Who, the most exquisite {Claudio}?
390    <S {Bor}.> Euen he.
391   *<S {Iohn}.> A proper squier, and who, and who, which way
392    lookes he?
393   *<S {Bor}.> Mary on {Hero}, the daughter and Heire of {Leo-nato}.
394   _
395   *<S {Iohn}.> A very forward March- chicke, how came you
396    to this:
397   *<S {Bor}.> Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoa-king
398   *a musty roome, comes me the Prince and {Claudio},
399   *hand in hand in sad conference: I whipt behind the Ar-ras,
400   *and there heard it agreed vpon, that the Prince should
401   *wooe {Hero} for himselfe, and hauing obtain'd her, giue
402    her to Count {Claudio}.
403   *<S {Iohn}.> Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue food
404   *to my displeasure, that young start- vp hath all the glorie
405   *of my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way, I blesse
406   *my selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will assist
407    mee?
408    <S {Conr}.> To the death my Lord.
409   *<S {Iohn}.> Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the
410   *greater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my
411    minde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?
412    <S {Bor}.> Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.
413    <D {Exeunt}.>
414    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
415   *<D {Enter Leonato, his brother, his wife, Hero his daughter, and}
416    {#Beatrice his neece, and a kinsman}.>
417    <S {Leonato}.> Was not Count {Iohn} here at supper?
418    <S {Brother}.> I saw him not.
419   *<S {Beatrice}.> How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer
420    can see him, but I am heart- burn'd an howre after.
421    <S {Hero}.> He is of a very melancholy disposition.
422   *<S {Beatrice}.> Hee were an excellent man that were made
423   *iust in the mid- way betweene him and {Benedicke}, the one
424   *is too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too
425    like my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling.
426   *<S {Leon}.> Then halfe signior {Benedicks} tongue in Count
427   *{Iohns} mouth, and halfe Count {Iohns} melancholy in Sig-nior
428    {Benedicks} face.
429   *<S {Beat}.> With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and
430   *money enough in his purse, such a man would winne any
431    woman in the world, if he could get her good #will.
432   *<S {Leon}.> By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a
433    husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
434    <S {Brother}.> Infaith shee's too curst.
435   *<S {Beat}.> Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen Gods
436   *sending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst Cow
437    short hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none.
438   *<S {Leon}.> So, by being too curst, God will send you no
439    hornes.
440   *<S {Beat}.> Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which
441   *blessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and
442   *euening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
443    beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen.
444   *<S {Leonato}.> You may light vpon a husband that hath no
445    beard.
446   *<S {Beatrice}.> What should I doe with him? dresse him in
447   *my apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he
448   *that hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath
449   *no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a
450   *youth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am
451   *not for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in ear-nest
452   *of the Berrord, and leade his Apes into #hell.
453    <S {Leon}.> Well then, goe you into #hell.
454   *<S {Beat}.> No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill
455   *meete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,
456   *and say, get you to heauen {Beatrice}, get you to heauen,
457   *heere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,
458   *and away to S[aint]. {Peter}: for the heauens, hee shewes mee
459   *where the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as
460    the day is long.
461   *<S {Brother}.> Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
462    father.
463   *<S {Beatrice}.> Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make curt-sie,
464   *and say, as it please you: but yet for all that cosin, let
465   *him be a handsome fellow, or else make an other cursie,
466    and say, father, as it please me.
467   *<S {Leonato}.> Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted
468    with a husband.
469   *<S {Beatrice}.> Not till God make men of some other met-tall
470   *then earth, would it not grieue a woman to be ouer-mastred
471   *with a peece of valiant dust: to make account of
472   *her life to a clod of waiward marle? no vnckle, ile none:
473   *{Adams} sonnes are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sinne
474    to match in my kinred.
475   *<S {Leon}.> Daughter, remember what I told you, if the
476   *Prince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your an-swere.
477   _
478   *<S {Beatrice}.> The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you
479   *be not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too impor-tant,
480   *tell him there is measure in euery thing, & so dance
481   *out the answere, for heare me {Hero}, wooing, wedding, &
482   *repenting, is as a Scotch jigge, a measure, and a cinque-pace:
483   *the first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigge
484   *(and full as fantasticall) the wedding manerly modest,
485   *(as a measure) full of state & aunchentry, and then comes
486   *repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace
487    faster and faster, till he sinkes into his graue.
      <P I5>
488    <S {Leonato}.> Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly.
489   *<S {Beatrice}.> I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church
490    by daylight.
491   *<S {Leon}.> The reuellers are entring brother, make good
492    roome.
493   *<D {Enter Prince, Pedro, Claudio, and Benedicke, and Balthasar},
494    {or dumbe Iohn, Maskers with a drum}.>
495   *<S {Pedro}.> Lady, will you walke about with your friend?
496   *<S {Hero}.> So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say
497   *nothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when I
498    walke away.
499    <S {Pedro}.> With me in your company.
500    <S {Hero}.> I may say so when I please.
501    <S {Pedro}.> And when please you to say so?
502   *<S {Hero}.> When I like your fauour, for God defend the
503    Lute should be like the case.
504   *<S {Pedro}.> My visor is {Philemons} roofe, within the house
505    is Loue.
506    <S {Hero}.> Why then your visor should be thatcht.
507    <S {Pedro}.> Speake low if you speake Loue.
508    <S {Bene}.> Well, I would you did like me.
509   *<S {Mar}.> So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue
510    manie #ill qualities.
511    <S {Bene}.> Which is one?
512    <S {Mar}.> I say my prayers alowd.
513   *<S {Ben}.> I loue you the better, the hearers may cry Amen.
514    <S {Mar}.> God match me with a good dauncer.
515    <S {Balt}.> Amen.
516   *<S {Mar}.> And God keepe him out of my sight when the
517    daunce is done: answer Clarke.
518    <S {Balt}.> No more words, the Clarke is answered.
519   *<S {Vrsula}.> I know you well enough, you are Signior {An-thonio}.
520   _
521    <S {Anth}.> At a word, I am not.
522    <S {Vrsula}.> I know you by the wagling of your head.
523    <S {Anth}.> To tell you true, I counterfet him.
524   *<S {Vrsu}.> You could neuer doe him so #ill well, vnlesse
525   *you were the very man: here's his dry hand vp & down,
526    you are he, you are he.
527    <S {Anth}.> At a word I am not.
528   *<S {Vrsula}.> Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know
529   *you by your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe
530   *to mumme, you are he, graces will appeare, and there's
531    an end.
532    <S {Beat}.> Will you not tell me who told you so?
533    <S {Bene}.> No, you shall pardon me.
534    <S {Beat}.> Nor will you not tell me who you are?
535    <S {Bened}.> Not now.
536   *<S {Beat}.> That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good
537   *wit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was Signi-or
538    {Benedicke} that said so.
539    <S {Bene}.> What's he?
540    <S {Beat}.> I am sure you know him well enough.
541    <S {Bene}.> Not I, beleeue me.
542    <S {Beat}.> Did he neuer make you laugh?
543    <S {Bene}.> I pray you what is he?
544   *<S {Beat}.> Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,
545   *onely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none
546   *but Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is
547   *not in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth
548   *men and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and
549   *beat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had
550    boorded me.
551   *<S {Bene}.> When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what
552    you say.
      <C B>
553   *<S {Beat}.> Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two
554   *on me, which peraduenture (not markt, or not laugh'd
555   *at) strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a Par-tridge
556   *wing saued, for the foole will eate no supper that
557    night. We must follow the Leaders.
558    <S {Ben}.> In euery good thing.
559   *<S {Bea}.> Nay, if they leade to any #ill, I will leaue them
560    at the next turning.  <D {Exeunt}.>
561    <D {Musicke for the dance}.>
562   *<S {Iohn}.> Sure my brother is amorous on {Hero}, and hath
563   *withdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the
564    Ladies follow her, and but one visor remaines.
565   *<S {Borachio}.> And that is {Claudio}, I know him by his bea-ring.
566   _
567    <S {Iohn}.> Are not you signior {Benedicke}?
568    <S {Clau}.> You know me well, I am hee.
569   *<S {Iohn}.> Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his
570   *loue, he is enamor'd on {Hero}, I pray you disswade him
571   *from her, she is no equall for his birth: you may do the
572    part of an honest man in it.
573    <S {Claudio}.> How know you he loues her?
574    <S {Iohn}.> I heard him sweare his affection.
575   *<S {Bor}.> So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her
576    to night.
577    <S {Iohn}.> Come, let vs to the banquet.  <D {Ex. manet Clau}.>
578    <S {Clau}.> Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,
579    But heare these #ill newes with the eares of {Claudio}:
580    'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:
581    Friendship is constant in all other things,
582    Saue in the Office and affaires of loue:
583    Therefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.
584    Let euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,
585    And trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,
586    Against whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:
587    This is an accident of hourely proofe,
588    Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore {Hero}.
589    <D {Enter Benedicke}.>
590    <S {Ben}.> Count {Claudio}.
591    <S {Clau}.> Yea, the same.
592    <S {Ben}.> Come, will you goe with me?
593    <S {Clau}.> Whither?
594   *<S {Ben}.> Euen to the next Willow, about your own bu-sinesse,
595   *Count.  What fashion will you weare the Gar-land
596   *off? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or
597   *vnder your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must
598    weare it one way, for the Prince hath got your {Hero}.
599    <S {Clau}>. I wish him ioy of her.
600   *<S {Ben}.> Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so
601   *they sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold
602    haue serued you thus?
603    <S {Clau}.> I pray you leaue me.
604   *<S {Ben}.> Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas the
605    boy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post.
606    <S {Clau}.> If it will not be, Ile leaue you.  <D {Exit}.>
607   *<S {Ben}.> Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into
608   *sedges: But that my Ladie {Beatrice} should know me, &
609   *not know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I goe
610   *vnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am
611   *apt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the
612   *base (though bitter) disposition of {Beatrice}, that putt's
613   *the world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile
614    be reuenged as I may.
615    <D {Enter the Prince}.>
616   *<S {Pedro}.> Now Signior, where's the Count, did you
617    see him?
      <P I5v><C C>
618   *<S {Bene}.> Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady
619   *Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a
620   *Warren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that your
621   *grace had got the #will of this young Lady, and I offered
622   *him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a
623   *garland, as being forsaken, or to binde him a rod, as be-ing
624    worthy to be whipt.
625    <S {Pedro}.> To be whipt, what's his fault?
626   *<S {Bene}.> The flat transgression of a Schoole- boy, who
627   *being ouer- ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his
628    companion, and he steales it.
629   *<S {Pedro}.> Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the
630    transgression is in the stealer.
631   *<S {Ben}.> Yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene
632   *made, and the garland too, for the garland he might haue
633   *worne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed on
634    you, who (as I take it) haue stolne his birds nest.
635   *<S {Pedro}.> I will but teach them to sing, and restore them
636    to the owner.
637   *<S {Bene}.> If their singing answer your saying, by my faith
638    you say honestly.
639   *<S {Pedro}.> The Lady {Beatrice} hath a quarrell to you, the
640   *Gentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much
641    wrong'd by you.
642   *<S {Bene}.> O she misusde me past the indurance of a block:
643   *an oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue an-swered
644   *her: my very visor began to assume life, and scold
645   *with her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene my
646   *selfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller
647   *then a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such im-possible
648   *conueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man at a
649   *marke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee speakes
650   *poynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath were
651   *as terrible as terminations, there were no liuing neere
652   *her, she would infect to the north starre: I would not
653   *marry her, though she were indowed with all that {Adam}
654   *had left him before he transgrest, she would haue made
655   *{Hercules} haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft his club to
656   *make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you shall finde
657   *her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God
658   *some scholler would coniure her, for certainely while she
659   *is heere, a man may liue as quiet in #hell, as in a sanctuary,
660   *and people sinne vpon purpose, because they would goe
661   *thither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation
662    followes her.
663    <D {Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero}.>
664    <S {Pedro}.> Looke heere she comes.
665   *<S {Bene}.> Will your Grace command mee any seruice to
666   *the worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now
667   *to the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I
668   *will fetch you a tooth- picker now from the furthest inch
669   *of Asia: bring you the length of {Prester Iohns} foot: fetch
670   *you a hayre off the great {Chams} beard: doe you any em-bassage
671   *to the Pigmies, rather then hould three words
672   *conference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment
673    for me?
674    <S {Pedro}.> None, but to desire your good company.
675   *<S {Bene}.> O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot in-dure
676    this Lady tongue.  <D {Exit}.>
677   *<S {Pedr}.> Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of
678    Signior {Benedicke}.
679   *<S {Beatr}.> Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me #a while, and I
680   *gaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one, marry
681   *once before he wonne it of mee, with false dice, therefore
682    your Grace may well say I haue lost it.
683   *<S {Pedro}.> You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put
684    him downe.
685   *<S {Beat}.> So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest
686   *I should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought
687    Count {Claudio}, whom you sent me to seeke.
688   *<S {Pedro}.> Why how now Count, wherfore are you sad?
689    <S {Claud}.> Not sad my Lord.
690    <S {Pedro}.> How then? sicke?
691    <S {Claud}.> Neither, my Lord.
692   *<S {Beat}.> The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,
693   *nor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and some-thing
694    of a iealous complexion.
695   *<S {Pedro}.> Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true.
696   *though Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:
697   *heere {Claudio}, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire {Hero}
698   *is won, I haue broke with her father, and his good #will
699   *obtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue
700    thee ioy.
701   *<S {Leona}.> Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
702   *my fortunes: his grace hath made the match, & all grace
703    say, Amen to it.
704    <S {Beatr}.> Speake Count, tis your Qu.
705   *<S {Claud}.> Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were
706   *but little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you
707   *are mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and
708    doat vpon the exchange.
709   *<S {Beat}.> Speake cosin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth
710    with a kisse, and let not him speake neither.
711    <S {Pedro}.> In faith Lady you haue a merry heart.
712   *<S {Beatr}.> Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes
713   *on the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare
714    that he is in my heart.
715    <S {Clau}.> And so she doth coosin.
716   *<S {Beat}.> Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one
717   *to the world but I, and I am sun- burn'd, I may sit in a cor-ner
718    and cry, heigh ho for a husband.
719    <S {Pedro}.> Lady {Beatrice}, I will get you one.
720   *<S {Beat}.> I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:
721   *hath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your father
722    got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
723    <S {Prince}.> Will you haue me? Lady.
724   *<S {Beat}.> No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for
725   *working- daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie
726   *day: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne
727    to speake all mirth, and no matter.
728   *<S {Prince}.> Your silence most offends me, and to be mer-ry,
729   *best becomes you, for out of question, you were born
730    in a merry howre.
731   *<S {Beatr}.> No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then
732   *there was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne: co-sins
733    God giue you ioy.
734   *<S {Leonato}.> Neece, will you looke to those things I told
735    you of?
736   *<S {Beat}.> I cry you mercy Vncle, by your Graces pardon.
737    <D {Exit Beatrice}.>
738    <S {Prince}.> By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady.
739   *<S {Leon}.> There's little of the melancholy element in her
740   *my Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not
741   *euer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath
742   *often dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with
743    laughing.
744   *<S {Pedro}.> Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband.
745   *<S {Leonato}.> O, by no meanes, she mocks all her wooers
746    out of suite.
747    <S {Prince}.> She were an excellent wife for {Benedick}.
748   *<S {Leonato}.> O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke
      <P I6>
749    married, they would talke themselues madde.
750   *<S {Prince}.> Counte {Claudio}, when meane you to goe to
751    Church?
752   *<S {Clau}.> To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,
753    till Loue haue all his rites.
754   *<S {Leonato}.> Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is
755   *hence a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue
756    all things answer minde.
757   *<S {Prince}.> Come, you shake the head at so long a brea-thing,
758   *but I warrant thee {Claudio}, the time shall not goe
759   *dully by vs, I will in the {interim}, vndertake one of {Her-cules}
760   *labors, which is, to bring Signior {Benedicke} and the
761   *Lady {Beatrice} into a mountaine of affection, th' one with
762   *th' other, I would faine haue it a match, and I doubt not
763   *but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assi-stance
764    as I shall giue you direction.
765   *<S {Leonato}.> My Lord, I am for you, though it cost mee
766    ten nights watchings.
767    <S {Claud}.> And I my Lord.
768    <S {Prin}.> And you #to gentle {Hero}?
769   *<S {Hero}.> I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe
770    my cosin to a good husband.
771   *<S {Prin}.> And {Benedick} is not the vnhopefullest husband
772   *that I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a noble
773   *straine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty, I will
774   *teach you how to humour your cosin, that shee shall fall
775   *in loue with {Benedicke}, and I, with your two helpes, will
776   *so practise on {Benedicke}, that in despight of his quicke
777   *wit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in loue with
778   *{#Beatrice}: if wee can doe this, {Cupid} is no longer an Ar-cher,
779   *his glory shall be ours, for wee are the onely loue-gods,
780    goe in with me, and I will tell you my drift.  <D {Exit}.>
781    <D {Enter Iohn and Borachio}.>
782   *<S {Ioh}.> It is so, the Count {Claudio} shal marry the daugh-ter
783    of {Leonato}.
784    <S {Bora}.> Yea my Lord, but I can crosse it.
785   *<S {Iohn}.> Any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be
786   *medicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him, and
787   *whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly
788    with mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?
789   *<S {Bor}.> Not honestly my Lord, but so couertly, that no
790    dishonesty shall appeare in me.
791    <S {Iohn}.> Shew me breefely how.
792   *<S {Bor}.> I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how
793   *much I am in the fauour of {Margaret}, the waiting gentle-woman
794    to {Hero}.
795    <S {Iohn}.> I remember.
796   *<S {Bor}.> I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
797   *appoint her to looke out at her Ladies chamber window.
798   *<S {Iohn}.> What life is in that, to be the death of this mar-riage?
799   _
800   *<S {Bor}.> The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
801   *you to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that
802   *hee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned
803   *{#Claudio}, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a
804    contaminated stale, such a one as {Hero}.
805    <S {Iohn}.> What proofe shall I make of that?
806   *<S {Bor}.> Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe
807   *{#Claudio}, to vndoe {Hero}, and kill {Leonato}, looke you for a-ny
808    other issue?
809   *<S {Iohn}.> Onely to despight them, I will endeauour any
810    thing.
811   *<S {Bor}.> Goe then, finde me a meete howre, to draw on
812   *{#Pedro} and the Count {Claudio} alone, tell them that you
813   *know that {Hero} loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both
814   *to the Prince and {Claudio} (as in a loue of your brothers
815   *honor who hath made this match) and his friends repu-tation,
816   *who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
817   *of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarce-ly
818   *beleeue this without triall: offer them instances which
819   *shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her
820   *chamber window, heare me call {Margaret}, {Hero}; heare
821   *{Margaret} terme me {Claudio}, and bring them to see this
822   *the very night before the intended wedding, for in the
823   *meane time, I will so fashion the matter, that {Hero} shall
824   *be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of
825   *{Heroes} disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,
826    and all the preparation ouerthrowne.
827   *<S {Iohn}.> Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will
828   *put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and
829    thy fee is a thousand ducates.
830   *<S {Bor}.> Be thou constant in the accusation, and my cun-ning
831    shall not shame me.
832   *<S {Iohn}.> I will presentlie goe learne their day of marri-age.
833    <D {Exit}.>
834    <D {Enter Benedicke alone}.>
835    <S {Bene}.> Boy.
836    <S {Boy}.> Signior.
837   *<S {Bene}.> In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it
838    hither to me in the orchard.
839    <S {Boy}.> I am heere already sir.  <D {Exit}.>
840   *<S {Bene}.> I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and
841   *heere againe. I doe much wonder, that one man seeing
842   *how much another man is a foole, when he dedicates his
843   *behauiours to loue, will after hee hath laught at such
844   *shallow follies in others, become the argument of his
845   *owne scorne, by falling in loue, & such a man is {Claudio}.
846   *I haue known when there was no musicke with him but
847   *the drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the
848   *taber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue
849   *walkt ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will
850   *he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dub-let:
851   *he was wont to speake plaine, & to the purpose (like
852   *an honest man & a souldier) and now is he turn'd ortho-graphy,
853   *his words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so
854   *many strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, & see with
855   *these eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee
856   *sworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile
857   *take my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he
858   *shall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet
859   *I am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertu-ous,
860   *yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,
861   *one woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall
862   *be, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile ne-uer
863   *cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,
864   *or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of
865   *good discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal
866   *be of what colour it please God, hah! the Prince and
867    Monsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.
868    <D {Enter Prince, Leonato, Claudio, and Iacke Wilson}.>
869    <S {Prin}.> Come, shall we heare this musicke?
870   *<S {Claud}.> Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is.
871    As husht on purpose to grace harmonie.
872    <S {Prin}.> See you where {Benedicke} hath hid himselfe?
873    <S {Clau}.> O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,
874    Wee'll fit the kid- foxe with a penny worth.
875   *<S {Prince}.> Come {Balthasar}, wee'll heare that song again.
876    <S {Balth}.> O good my Lord, taxe not so bad a voyce,
877    To slander musicke any more then once.
878    <S {Prin}.> It is the witnesse still of excellency,
      <P I6v>
879    To slander Musicke any more then once.
880    <S {Prince}.> It is the witnesse still of excellencie,
881    To put a strange face on his owne perfection,
882    I pray thee sing, and let me woe no more.
883    <S {Balth}.> Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,
884    Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,
885    To her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,
886    Yet will he sweare he loues.
887    <S {Prince}.> Nay pray thee come,
888    Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,
889    Doe it in notes.
890    <S {Balth}.> Note this before my notes,
891    Theres not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
892   *<S {Prince}.> Why these are very crotchets that he speaks,
893    Note notes forsooth, and nothing.
894   *<S {Bene}.> Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is it
895   *not strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of
896   *mens bodies? well, a horne for my money when all's
897    done.
898    <D {The Song}.>
899    {Sigh no more Ladies, sigh no more},
900    {Men were deceiuers euer},
901    {One foote in Sea, and one on shore},
902    {To one thing constant neuer},
903    {Then sigh not so, but let them goe},
904    {And be you blithe and bonnie},
905    {Conuerting all your sounds of woe},

910    {Since summer first was leauy},
911    {Then sigh not so, &c}.
912    <S {Prince}.> By my troth a good song.
913    <S {Balth}.> And an #ill singer, my Lord.
914   *<S {Prince}.> Ha, no, no faith, thou singst well enough for a
915    shift.
916   *<S {Ben}.> #And he had been a dog that should haue howld
917   *thus, they would haue hang'd him, and I pray God his
918   *bad voyce bode no mischiefe, I had as liefe haue heard
919   *the night- rauen, come what plague could haue come af-ter
920    it.
921   *<S {Prince}.> Yea marry, dost thou heare {Balthasar}? I pray
922   *thee get vs some excellent musick: for to morrow night
923    we would haue it at the Lady {Heroes} chamber window.
924    <S {Balth}.> The best I can, my Lord. <D {Exit Balthasar}.>
925   *<S {Prince}.> Do so, farewell. Come hither {Leonato}, what
926   *was it you told me of to day, that your Niece {Beatrice}
927    was in loue with signior {Benedicke}?
928   *<S {Cla}.> O #I, stalke on, stalke on, the foule sits. I did ne-uer
929    thinke that Lady would haue loued any man.
930   *<S {Leon}.> No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that she
931   *should so dote on Signior {Benedicke}, whom shee hath in
932    all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre.
933    <S {Bene}.> Is't possible? sits the winde in that corner?
934   *<S {Leo}.> By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to
935   *thinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affe-ction,
936    it is past the infinite of thought.
937    <S {Prince}.> May be she doth but counterfeit.
938    <S {Claud}.> Faith like enough.
939   *<S {Leon}.> O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counter-feit
940   *of passion, came so neere the life of passion as she dis-couers
941    it.
942    <S {Prince}.> Why what effects of passion shewes she?
943    <S {Claud}.> Baite the hooke well, this fish will bite.
944   *<S {Leon}.> What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you
945    heard my daughter tell you how.
946    <S {Clau}.> She did indeed.
947   *<S {Prince}.> How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I would
948   *haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all
949    assaults of affection.
950   *<S {Leo}.> I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially
951    against {Benedicke}.
952   *<S {Bene}.> I should thinke this a gull, but that the white-bearded
953   *fellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure hide
954    himselfe in such reuerence.
955    <S {Claud}.> He hath tane th' infection, hold it vp.
956   *<S {Prince}.> Hath shee made her affection known to {Bene-dicke}:
957   _
958   *<S {Leonato}.> No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her
959    torment.
960   *<S {Claud}.> 'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall
961   *I, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with scorne,
962    write to him that I loue him?
963   *<S {Leo}.> This saies shee now when shee is beginning to
964   *write to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and
965   *there will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet
966    of paper: my daughter tells vs all.
967   *<S {Clau}.> Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember
968    a pretty iest your daughter told vs of.
969   *<S {Leon}.> O when she had writ it, & was reading it ouer,
970    she found {Benedicke} and {Beatrice} betweene the sheete.
971    <S {Clau}.> That.
972   *<S {Leon}.> O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
973   *raild at her self, that she should be so immodest to write,
974   *to one that shee knew would flout her: I measure him,
975   *saies she, by my owne spirit, for I should flout him if hee
976    writ to mee, yea though I loue him, I should.
977   *<S {Clau}.> Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,
978   *sobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O
979    sweet {Benedicke}, God giue me patience.
980   *<S {Leon}.> She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the
981   *extasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter is
982   *somtime afeard she will doe a desperate out- rage to her
983    selfe, it is very true.
984   *<S {Prince}.> It were good that {Benedicke} knew of it by some
985    other, if she will not discouer it.
986   *<S {Clau}.> To what end? he would but make a sport of it,
987    and torment the poore Lady worse.
988   *<S {Prin}.> #And he should, it were an almes to hang him,
989   *shee's an excellent sweet Lady, and (out of all suspition,)
990    she is vertuous.
991    <S {Claudio}.> And she is exceeding wise.
992    <S {Prince}.> In euery thing, but in louing {Benedicke}.
993   *<S {Leon}.> O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in
994   *so tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud
995   *hath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,
996    being her Vncle, and her Guardian.
997   *<S {Prince}.> I would shee had bestowed this dotage on
998   *mee, I would haue daft all other respects, and made her
999   *halfe my selfe: I pray you tell {Benedicke} of it, and heare
1000   what he will say.
1001   <S {Leon}.> Were it good thinke you?
1002  *<S {Clau}.> {Hero} thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she
1003  *will die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee
1004  *make her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her,
1005  *rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed
1006   crossenesse.
1007  *<S {Prince}.> She doth well, if she should make tender of her
      <P K1>
1008  *loue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man (as you
1009   know all) hath a contemptible spirit.
1010   <S {Clau}.> He is a very proper man.
1011   <S {Prin}.> He hath indeed a good outward happines.
1012   <S {Clau}.> 'Fore God, and in my minde very wise.
1013  *<S {Prin}.> He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like
1014   wit.
1015   <S {Leon}.> And I take him to be valiant.
1016  *<S {Prin}.> As {Hector}, I assure you, and in the managing of
1017  *quarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee auoydes
1018  *them with great discretion, or vndertakes them with a
1019   Christian- like feare.
1020  *<S {Leon}.> If hee doe feare God, #a must necessarilie keepe
1021  *peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a
1022   quarrell with feare and trembling.
1023  *<S {Prin}.> And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,
1024  *howsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee
1025  *will make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe
1026   see {Benedicke}, and tell him of her loue.
1027  *<S {Claud}.> Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out
1028   with good counsell.
1029  *<S {Leon}.> Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart
1030   out first.
1031  *<S {Prin}.> Well, we will heare further of it by your daugh-ter,
1032  *let it coole the while, I loue {Benedicke} well, and I
1033  *could wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see
1034   how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady.
1035   <S {Leon}.> My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready.
1036  *<S {Clau}.> If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil neuer
1037   trust my expectation.
1038  *<S {Prin}.> Let there be the same Net spread for her, and
1039  *that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry:
1040  *the sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of ano-thers
1041  *dotage, and no such matter, that's the Scene that I
1042  *would see, which will be meerely a dumbe shew: let vs
1043   send her to call him into dinner.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1044  *<S {Bene}.> This can be no tricke, the conference was sadly
1045  *borne, they haue the truth of this from {Hero}, they seeme
1046  *to pittie the Lady: it seemes her affections haue the full
1047  *bent: loue me? why it must be requited: I heare how I
1048  *am censur'd, they say I will beare my selfe proudly, if I
1049  *perceiue the loue come from her: they say too, that she
1050  *will rather die than giue any signe of affection: I did ne-uer
1051  *thinke to marry, I must not seeme proud, happy are
1052  *they that heare their detractions, and can put them to
1053  *mending: they say the Lady is faire, 'tis a truth, I can
1054  *beare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so, I cannot re-prooue
1055  *it, and wise, but for louing me, by my troth it is
1056  *no addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her
1057  *folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance
1058  *haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken
1059  *on mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:
1060  *but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in
1061  *his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips
1062  *and sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe
1063  *a man from the careere of his humour? No, the world
1064  *must be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I
1065  *did not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes
1066  *{#Beatrice}: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some
1067   markes of loue in her.
1068   <D {Enter Beatrice}.>
1069  *<S {Beat}.> Against my #wil I am sent to bid you come in to
1070   dinner.
1071   <S {Bene}.> Faire {Beatrice}, I thanke you for your paines.
1072  *<S {Beat}.> I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then
1073  *you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I
1074   would not haue come.
1075   <S {Bene}.> You take pleasure then in the message.
1076  *<S {Beat}.> Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues
1077  *point, and choake a daw withall: you haue no stomacke
1078   signior, fare you well.  <D {Exit}.>
1079  *<S {Bene}.> Ha, against my #will I am sent to bid you come
1080  *into dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I tooke
1081  *no more paines for those thankes then you took paines
1082  *to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that I
1083  *take for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty
1084  *of her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I
1085   will goe get her picture.  <D {Exit}.>
1086   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1087   <D {Enter Hero and two Gentlemen, Margaret, and Vrsula}.>
1088   <S {Hero}.> Good {Margaret} runne thee to the parlour,
1089   There shalt thou finde my Cosin {Beatrice},
1090   Proposing with the Prince and {Claudio},
1091   Whisper her eare, and tell her I and {Vrsula},
1092   Walke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse
1093   Is all of her, say that thou ouer- heardst vs,
1094   And bid her steale into the pleached bower,
1095   Where hony- suckles ripened by the sunne,
1096   Forbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,
1097   Made proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,
1098  *Against that power that bred it, there will she hide her,
1099   To listen our purpose, this is thy office,
1100   Beare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone.
1101   <S {Marg}.> Ile make her come I warrant you presently.
1102   <S {Hero}.> Now {Vrsula}, when {Beatrice} doth come,
1103   As we do trace this alley vp and downe,
1104   Our talke must onely be of {Benedicke},
1105   When I doe name him, let it be thy part,
1106   To praise him more then euer man did merit,
1107   My talke to thee must be how {Benedicke}
1108   Is sicke in loue with {Beatrice}; of this matter,
1109   Is little {Cupids} crafty arrow made,
1110   That onely wounds by heare- say: now begin,
1111   <D {Enter Beatrice}.>
1112   For looke where {Beatrice} like a Lapwing runs
1113   Close by the ground, to heare our conference.
1114   <S {Vrs}.> The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
1115   Cut with her golden ores the siluer streame,
1116   And greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:
1117   So angle we for {Beatrice}, who euen now,
1118   Is couched in the wood- bine couerture,
1119   Feare you not my part of the Dialogue.
1120  *<S {Her}.> Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,
1121   Of the false sweete baite that we lay for it:
1122   No truely {Vrsula}, she is too disdainfull,
1123   I know her spirits are as coy and wilde,
1124   As Haggerds of the rocke.
1125   <S {Vrsula}.> But are you sure,
1126   That {Benedicke} loues {Beatrice} so intirely?
1127   <S {Her}.> So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord.
1128   <S {Vrs}.> And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?
1129   <S {Her}.> They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,
1130   But I perswaded them, if they lou'd {Benedicke},
      <P K1v>
1131   To wish him wrastle with affection,
1132   And neuer to let {Beatrice} know of it.
1133   <S {Vrsula}.> Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman
1134   Deserue as full as fortunate a bed,
1135   As euer {Beatrice} shall couch vpon?
1136   <S {Hero}.> O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,
1137   As much as may be yeelded to a man:
1138   But Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,
1139   Of prowder stuffe then that of {Beatrice}:
1140   Disdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,
1141   Mis- prizing what they looke on, and her wit
1142   Values it selfe so highly, that to her
1143   All matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,
1144   Nor take no shape nor proiect of affection,
1145   Shee is so selfe indeared.
1146   <S {Vrsula}.> Sure I thinke so,
1147   And therefore certainely it were not good
1148   She knew his loue, lest she make sport at it.
1149   <S {Hero}.> Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,
1150   How wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.
1151   But she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,
1152   She would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:
1153   If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,
1154   Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce #ill headed:
1155   If low, an agot very vildlie cut:
1156   If speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:
1157   If silent, why a blocke moued with none.
1158   So turnes she euery man the wrong side out,
1159   And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that
1160   Which simplenesse and merit purchaseth.
1161   <S {Vrsu}.> Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
1162   <S {Hero}.> No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,
1163   As {Beatrice} is, cannot be commendable,
1164   But who dare tell her so? if I should speake,
1165   She would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me
1166   Out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,
1167   Therefore let {Benedicke} like couered fire,
1168   Consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:
1169   It were a better death, to die with mockes,
1170   Which is as bad as die with tickling.
1171   <S {Vrsu}.> Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say.
1172   <S {Hero}.> No, rather I will goe to {Benedicke},
1173   And counsaile him to fight against his passion,
1174   And truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,
1175   To staine my cosin with, one doth not know,
1176   How much an #ill word may impoison liking.
1177   <S {Vrsu}.> O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,
1178   She cannot be so much without true iudgement,
1179   Hauing so swift and excellent a wit
1180   As she is prisde to haue, as to refuse
1181   So rare a Gentleman as signior {Benedicke}.
1182   <S {Hero}.> He is the onely man of Italy,
1183   Alwaies excepted, my deare {Claudio}.
1184   <S {Vrsu}.> I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,
1185   Speaking my fancy: Signior {Benedicke},
1186   For shape, for bearing argument and valour,
1187   Goes formost in report through Italy.
1188   <S {Hero}.> Indeed he hath an excellent good name.
1189   <S {Vrsu}.> His excellence did earne it ere he had it:
1190   When are you married Madame?
1191   <S {Hero}.> Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,
1192   Ile shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,
1193   Which is the best to furnish me to morrow.
1194   <S {Vrsu}.> Shee's tane I warrant you,
1195   We haue caught her Madame?
1196   <S {Hero}.> If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,
1197   Some {Cupid} kills with arrowes, some with traps.  <D {Exit}.>
1198   <S {Beat}.> What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?
1199   Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?
1200   Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,
1201   No glory liues behinde the backe of such.
1202   And {Benedicke}, loue on, I will requite thee,
1203   Taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:
1204   If thou dost loue, my kindnesse shall incite thee
1205   To binde our loues vp in a holy band.
1206   For others say thou dost deserue, and I
1207   Beleeue it better then reportingly.  <D {Exit}.>
1208   <D {Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedicke, and Leonato}.>
1209  *<S {Prince}.> I doe but stay till your marriage be consum-mate,
1210   and then go I toward Arragon.
1211  *<S {Clau}.> Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouch-safe
1212   me.
1213  *<S {Prin}.> Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new
1214  *glosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat
1215  *and forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with
1216  *{Benedicke} for his companie, for from the crowne of his
1217  *head, to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice
1218  *or thrice cut {Cupids} bow- string, and the little hang- man
1219  *dare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell,
1220  *and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinkes,
1221   his tongue speakes.
1222   <S {Bene}.> Gallants, I am not as I haue bin.
1223   <S {Leo}.> So say I, methinkes you are sadder.
1224   <S {Claud}.> I hope he be in loue.
1225  *<S {Prin}.> Hang him truant, there's no true drop of bloud
1226  *in him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad, he wants
1227   money.
1228   <S {Bene}.> I haue the tooth- ach.
1229   <S {Prin}.> Draw it.
1230   <S {Bene}.> Hang it.
1231  *<S {Claud}.> You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
1232   <S {Prin}.> What? sigh for the tooth- ach.
1233   <S {Leon}.> Where is but a humour or a worme.
1234  *<S {Bene}.> Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee
1235   that has it.
1236   <S {Clau}.> Yet say I, he is in loue.
1237  *<S {Prin}.> There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse
1238  *it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to bee a
1239  *Dutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow: vnlesse hee
1240  *haue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee
1241  *is no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare
1242   he is.
1243  *<S {Clau}.> If he be not in loue with some woman, there
1244  *is no beleeuing old signes, #a brushes his hat #a mornings,
1245   What should that bode?
1246   <S {Prin}.> Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?
1247  *<S {Clau}.> No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with
1248  *him, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie
1249   stuft tennis balls.
1250  *<S {Leon}.> Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the
1251   losse of a beard.
1252  *<S {Prin}.> Nay #a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell
1253   him out by that?
1254  *<S {Clau}.> That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in
1255   loue.
1256   <S {Prin}.> The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
1257   <S {Clau}.> And when was he wont to wash his face?
1258  *<S {Prin}.> Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare
1259   what they say of him.
1260  *<S {Clau}.> Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept
1261   into a lute- string, and now gouern'd by stops.
      <P K2>
1262  *<S {Prin}.> Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,
1263   he is in loue.
1264   <S {Clau}.> Nay, but I know who loues him.
1265  *<S {Prince}.> That would I know too, I warrant one that
1266   knowes him not.
1267  *<S {Cla}.> Yes, and his #ill conditions, and in despight of all,
1268   dies for him.
1269   <S {Prin}.> Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards.
1270  *<S {Bene}.> Yet is this no charme for the tooth- ake, old sig-nior,
1271  *walke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine
1272  *wise words to speake to you, which these hobby- horses
1273   must not heare.
1274  *<S {Prin}.> For my life to breake with him about {Beatrice}.
1275  *<S {Clau}.> 'Tis euen so, {Hero} and {Margaret} haue by this
1276  *played their parts with {Beatrice}, and then the two Beares
1277   will not bite one another when they meete.
1278   <D {Enter Iohn the Bastard}.>
1279   <S {Bast}.> My Lord and brother, God saue you.
1280   <S {Prin}.> Good den brother.
1281  *<S {Bast}.> If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you.
1282   <S {Prince}.> In priuate?
1283  *<S {Bast}.> If it please you, yet Count {Claudio} may heare,
1284   for what I would speake of, concernes him.
1285   <S {Prin}.> What's the matter?
1286  *<S {Basta}.> Meanes your Lordship to be married to mor-row?
1287  _
1288   <S {Prin}.> You know he does.
1289  *<S {Bast}.> I know not that when he knowes what I know.
1290  *<S {Clau}.> If there be any impediment, I pray you disco-uer
1291   it.
1292  *<S {Bast}.> You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare
1293  *hereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will ma-nifest,
1294  *for my brother (I thinke, he holds you well, and in
1295  *dearenesse of heart) hath holpe to effect your ensuing
1296   marriage: surely sute #ill spent, and labour #ill bestowed.
1297   <S {Prin}.> Why, what's the matter?
1298  *<S {Bastard}.> I came hither to tell you, and circumstances
1299  *shortned, (for she hath beene too long #a talking of) the
1300   Lady is disloyall.
1301   <S {Clau}.> Who {Hero}?
1302  *<S {Bast}.> Euen shee, {Leonatoes Hero}, your {Hero}, euery
1303   mans {Hero}.
1304   <S {Clau}.> Disloyall?
1305  *<S {Bast}.> The word is too good to paint out her wicked-nesse,
1306  *I could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse
1307  *title, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further war-rant:
1308  *goe but with mee to night, you shal see her cham-ber
1309  *window entred, euen the night before her wedding
1310  *day, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her: But it
1311   would better fit your honour to change your minde.
1312   <S {Claud}.> May this be so?
1313   <S {Princ}.> I will not thinke it.
1314  *<S {Bast}.> If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not
1315  *that you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you
1316  *enough, and when you haue seene more, & heard more,
1317   proceed accordingly.
1318  *<S {Clau}.> If I see any thing to night, why I should not
1319  *marry her to morrow in the congregation, where I shold
1320   wedde, there will I shame her.
1321  *<S {Prin}.> And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will
1322   ioyne with thee to disgrace her.
1323  *<S {Bast}.> I will disparage her no farther, till you are my
1324  *witnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the issue
1325   shew it selfe.
1326   <S {Prin}.> O day vntowardly turned!
1327   <S {Claud}.> O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!
1328  *<S {Bastard}.> O plague right well preuented! so will you
1329   say, when you haue seene the sequele.  <D {Exit}.>
1330   <D {Enter Dogbery and his compartner with the watch}.>
1331   <S {Dog}.> Are you good men and true?
1332  *<S {Verg}.> Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer
1333   saluation body and soule.
1334  *<S {Dogb}.> Nay, that were a punishment too good for
1335  *them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
1336   chosen for the Princes watch.
1337  *<S {Verges}.> Well, giue them their charge, neighbour
1338   {Dogbery}.
1339  *<S {Dog}.> First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man
1340   to be Constable.
1341  *<S {Watch}.1.> {Hugh Ote- cake} sir, or {George Sea- coale}, for
1342   they can write and reade.
1343  *<S {Dogb}.> Come hither neighbour Sea- coale, God hath
1344  *blest you with a good name: to be a wel- fauoured man,
1345  *is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by
1346   Nature.
1347   <S {Watch} 2.> Both which Master Constable
1348  *<S {Dogb}.> You haue: I knew it would be your answere:
1349  *well, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, & make
1350  *no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that
1351  *appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are
1352  *thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the
1353  *Constable of the watch: therefore beare you the lan-thorne:
1354  *this is your charge: You shall comprehend all
1355  *vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the Prin-ces
1356   name.
1357   <S {Watch} 2.> How if #a will not stand?
1358  *<S {Dogb}.> Why then take no note of him, but let him go,
1359  *and presently call the rest of the Watch together, and
1360   thanke God you are ridde of a knaue.
1361  *<S {Verges}.> If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is
1362   none of the Princes subiects.
1363  *<S {Dogb}.> True, and they are to meddle with none but
1364  *the Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
1365  *streetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most
1366   tollerable, and not to be indured.
1367  *<S {Watch}.> We will rather sleepe than talke, wee know
1368   what belongs to a Watch.
1369  *<S {Dog}.> Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet
1370  *watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:
1371  *only haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you
1372  *are to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are
1373   drunke get them to bed.
1374   <S {Watch}.> How if they will not?
1375  *<S {Dogb}.> Why then let them alone till they are sober, if
1376  *they make you not then the better answere, you may say,
1377   they are not the men you tooke them for.
1378   <S {Watch}.> Well sir,
1379  *<S {Dogb}.> If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by
1380  *vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such
1381  *kinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,
1382   why the more is for your honesty.
1383  *<S {Watch}.> If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not
1384   lay hands on him.
1385  *<S {Dogb}.> Truly by your office you may, but I think they
1386  *that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way
1387  *for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew him-selfe
1388   what he is, and steale out of your company.
1389  *<S {Ver}.> You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner.
1390  *<S {Dog}.> Truely I would not hang a dog by my #will, much
1391   more a man who hath anie honestie in him.
      <P K2v><C D>
1392  *<S {Verges}.> If you heare a child crie in the night you must
1393   call to the nurse, and bid her still it.
1394  *<S {Watch}.> How if the nurse be asleepe and will not
1395   heare vs?
1396  *<S {Dog}.> Why then depart in peace, and let the childe
1397  *wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare
1398  *her Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when
1399   he bleates.
1400   <S {Verges}.> 'Tis verie true.
1401  *<S {Dog}.> This is the end of the charge: you constable
1402  *are to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the
1403   Prince in the night, you may staie him.
1404   <S {Verges}.> Nay birladie that I thinke #a cannot.
1405  *<S {Dog}.> Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
1406  *knowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not with-out
1407  *the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
1408  *offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
1409   his #will.
1410   <S {Verges}.> Birladie I thinke it be so.
1411  *<S {Dog}.> Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, #and there be
1412  *anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your
1413  *fellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,
1414   come neighbour.
1415  *<S {Watch}.> Well masters, we heare our charge, let vs go
1416  *sit here vpon the Church bench till two, and then all to
1417   bed.
1418  *<S {Dog}.> One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you
1419  *watch about signior {Leonatoes} doore, for the wedding be-ing
1420  *there to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,
1421   adiew, be vigitant I beseech you.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1422   <D {Enter Borachio and Conrade}.>
1423   <S {Bor}.> What, {Conrade}?
1424   <S {Watch}.> Peace, stir not.
1425   <S {Bor}.> {Conrade} I say.
1426   <S {Con}.> Here man, I am at thy elbow.
1427  *<S {Bor}.> Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there would
1428   a scabbe follow.
1429  *<S {Con}.> I will owe thee an answere for that, and now
1430   forward with thy tale.
1431  *<S {Bor}.> Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse, for it
1432  *drissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard, vtter all to
1433   thee.
1434   <S {Watch}.> Some treason masters, yet stand close.
1435  *<S {Bor}.> Therefore know, I haue earned of {#Don Iohn} a
1436   thousand Ducates.
1437  *<S {Con}.> Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?
1438  *<S {Bor}.> Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible a-nie
1439  *villanie should be so rich? for when rich villains haue
1440  *neede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price
1441   they will.
1442   <S {Con}.> I wonder at it.
1443  *<S {Bor}.> That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou knowest
1444  *that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloake, is no-thing
1445   to a man.
1446   <S {Con}.> Yes, it is apparell.
1447   <S {Bor}.> I meane the fashion.
1448   <S {Con}.> Yes the fashion is the fashion.
1449  *<S {Bor}.> Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but
1450   seest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?
1451  *<S {Watch}.> I know that deformed, #a has bin a vile theefe,
1452  *this vii. yeares, #a goes vp and downe like a gentle man:
1453   I remember his name.
1454   <S {Bor}.> Did'st thou not heare some bodie?
1455   <S {Con}.> No, 'twas the vaine on the house.
1456  *<S {Bor}.> Seest thou not (I say) what a deformed thiefe
1457  *this fashion is, how giddily #a turnes about all the Hot-blouds,
1458  *betweene, foureteene & fiue & thirtie, sometimes
1459  *fashioning them like {Pharaoes} souldiours in the rechie
1460  *painting, sometime like god Bels priests in the old
1461  *Church window, sometime like the shauen {Hercules} in
1462  *the smircht worm- eaten tapestrie, where his cod- peece
1463   seemes as massie as his club.
1464  *<S {Con}.> All this I see, and see that the fashion weares out
1465  *more apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe
1466  *giddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of
1467   thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
1468  *<S {Bor}.> Not so neither, but know that I haue to night
1469  *wooed {Margaret} the Lady {Heroes} gentle- woman, by the
1470  *name of {Hero}, she leanes me out at her mistris chamber-window,
1471  *bids me a thousand times good night: I tell
1472  *this tale vildly. I should first tell thee how the Prince
1473  *{#Claudio} and my Master planted, and placed, and possessed
1474  *by my Master {#Don Iohn}, saw #a far off in the Orchard this
1475   amiable incounter.
1476   <S {Con}.> And thought thy {Margaret} was {Hero}?
1477  *<S {Bor}.> Two of them did, the Prince and {Claudio}, but the
1478  *diuell my Master knew she was {Margaret} and partly by
1479  *his oathes, which first possest them, partly by the darke
1480  *night which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my villa-nie,
1481  *which did confirme any slander that {#Don Iohn} had
1482  *made, away went {Claudio} enraged, swore hee would
1483  *meete her as he was apointed next morning at the Tem-ple,
1484  *and there, before the whole congregation shame her
1485  *with what he saw o're night, and send her home againe
1486   without a husband.
1487   <S {Watch}.1.> We charge you in the Princes name stand.
1488  *<S {Watch}.2.> Call vp the right master Constable, we haue
1489  *here recouered the most dangerous peece of lechery, that
1490   euer was knowne in the Common- wealth.
1491  *<S {Watch}.1.> And one Deformed is one of them, I know
1492   him, #a weares a locke.
1493   <S {Conr}.> Masters, masters.
1494  *<S {Watch}.2.> Youle be made bring deformed forth I war-rant
1495   you,
1496  *<S {Conr}.> Masters, neuer speake, we charge you, let vs o-bey
1497   you to goe with vs.
1498  *<S {Bor}.> We are like to proue a goodly commoditie, be-ing
1499   taken vp of these mens bils.
1500  *<S {Conr}.> A commoditie in question I warrant you, come
1501   weele obey you. <D {Exeunt}.>
1502   <D {Enter Hero, and Margaret, and Vrsula}.>
1503  *<S {Hero}.> Good {Vrsula} wake my cosin {Beatrice}, and de-sire
1504   her to rise.
1505   <S {Vrsu}.> I will Lady.
1506   <S {Her}.> And bid her come hither.
1507   <S {Vrs}.> Well.
1508   <S {Mar}.> Troth I thinke your other rebato were better.
1509   <S {Hero}.> No pray thee good {Meg}, Ile weare this.
1510  *<S {Marg}.> By my troth's not so good, and I warrant your
1511   cosin will say so.
1512  *<S {Hero}.> My cosin's a foole, and thou art another, ile
1513   weare none but this.
1514  *<S {Mar}.> I like the new tire within excellently, if the
1515  *haire were a thought browner: and your gown's a most
1516  *rare fashion yfaith, I saw the Dutchesse of {Millaines}
1517   gowne that they praise so.
1518   <S {Hero}.> O that exceedes they say.
1519  *<S {Mar}.> By my troth's but a night- gowne in respect of
1520  *yours, cloth #a gold and cuts, and lac'd with siluer, set with
1521  *pearles, downe sleeues, side sleeues, and skirts, round vn-derborn
1522  *with a blewish tinsel, but for a fine queint grace-full
1523   and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't.
      <P K3><C C>
1524  *<S {Hero}.> God giue mee ioy to weare it, for my heart is
1525   exceeding heauy.
1526  *<S {Marga}.> 'Twill be heauier soone, by the waight of a
1527   man.
1528   <S {Hero}.> Fie vpon thee, art not asham'd?
1529  *<S {Marg}.> Of what Lady? of speaking honourably? is
1530  *not marriage honourable in a beggar? is not your Lord
1531  *honourable without marriage? I thinke you would haue
1532  *me say, sauing your reuerence a husband: and bad thin-king
1533  *doe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body, is
1534  *there any harme in the heauier for a husband? none I
1535  *thinke, #and it be the right husband, and the right wife,
1536  *otherwise 'tis light and not heauy, aske my Lady {Beatrice}
1537   else, here she comes.
1538   <D {Enter Beatrice}.>
1539   <S {Hero}.> Good morrow Coze.
1540   <S {Beat}.> Good morrow sweet {Hero}.
1541  *<S {Hero}.> Why how now? do you speake in the sick tune?
1542   <S {Beat}.> I am out of all other tune, me thinkes.
1543  *<S {Mar}.> Claps into Light #a loue, (that goes without a
1544   burden,) do you sing it and Ile dance it.
1545  *<S {Beat}.> #Ye Light aloue with your heeles, then if your
1546  *husband haue stables enough, you'll looke he shall lacke
1547   no barnes.
1548  *<S {Mar}.> O illegitimate construction! I scorne that with
1549   my heeles.
1550  *<S {Beat}.> 'Tis almost fiue #a clocke cosin, 'tis time you
1551   were ready, by my troth I am exceeding #ill, hey ho.
1552   <S {Mar}.> For a hauke, a horse, or a husband?
1553   <S {Beat}.> For the letter that begins them all, H.
1554  *<S {Mar}.> Well, #and you be not turn'd Turke, there's no
1555   more sayling by the starre.
1556   <S {Beat}.> What meanes the foole trow?
1557  *<S {Mar}.> Nothing I, but God send euery one their harts
1558   desire.
1559  *<S {Hero}.> These gloues the Count sent mee, they are an
1560   excellent perfume.
1561   <S {Beat}.> I am stuft cosin, I cannot smell.
1562  *<S {Mar}.> A maid and stuft! there's goodly catching of
1563   colde.
1564  *<S {Beat}.> O God helpe me, God help me, how long haue
1565   you profest apprehension?
1566  *<S {Mar}.> Euer since you left it, doth not my wit become
1567   me rarely?
1568  *<S {Beat}.> It is not seene enough, you should weare it in
1569   your cap, by my troth I am sicke.
1570  *<S {Mar}.> Get you some of this distill'd {carduus benedictus}
1571  *and lay it to your heart, it is the onely thing for a qualm.
1572   <S {Hero}.> There thou prick'st her with a thissell.
1573  *<S {Beat}.> {Benedictus}, why {benedictus}? you haue some mo-rall
1574   in this {benedictus}.
1575  *<S {Mar}.> Morall? no by my troth, I haue no morall mea-ning,
1576  *I meant plaine holy thissell, you may thinke per-chance
1577  *that I thinke you are in loue, nay birlady I am not
1578  *such a foole to thinke what I list, nor I list not to thinke
1579  *what I can, nor indeed, I cannot thinke, if I would thinke
1580  *my hart out of thinking, that you are in loue, or that you
1581  *will be in loue, or that you can be in loue: yet {Benedicke}
1582  *was such another, and now is he become a man, he swore
1583  *hee would neuer marry, and yet now in despight of his
1584  *heart he eates his meat without grudging, and how you
1585  *may be conuerted I know not, but me thinkes you looke
1586   with your eies as other women doe.
1587   <S {Beat}.> What pace is this that thy tongue keepes.
1588   <S {Mar}.> Not a false gallop.
1589   <D {Enter Vrsula}.>
1590   <S {Vrsula}.> Madam, withdraw, the Prince, the Count, sig-nior
1591  *{Benedicke}, #Don {Iohn}, and all the gallants of the

1593  *<S {Hero}.> Helpe me to dresse mee good coze, good {Meg},
1594   good {Vrsula}.
1595   <D {Enter Leonato, and the Constable, and the Headborough}.>
1596  *<S {Leonato}.> What would you with mee, honest neigh-bour?
1597  *<S {Const.Dog}.>   Mary sir I would haue some confidence
1598   with you, that decernes you nearely.
1599  *<S {Leon}.> Briefe I pray you, for you see it is a busie time
1600   with me.
1601   <S {Const.Dog}.> Mary this it is sir.
1602   <S {Headb}.> Yes in truth it is sir.
1603   <S {Leon}.> What is it my good friends?
1604  *<S {Con.Do}.> Goodman Verges sir speakes a little of the
1605  *matter, an old man sir, and his wits are not so blunt, as
1606  *God helpe I would desire they were, but infaith honest
1607   as the skin betweene his browes.
1608  *<S {Head}.> Yes I thank God, I am as honest as any man li-uing,
1609   that is an old man, and no honester then I.
1610  *<S {Con.Dog}.> Comparisons are odorous, palabras, neigh-bour
1611   Verges.
1612   <S {Leon}.> Neighbours, you are tedious.
1613  *<S {Con.Dog}.> It pleases your worship to say so, but we are
1614  *the poore Dukes officers, but truely for mine owne part,
1615  *if I were as tedious as a King I could finde in my heart to
1616   bestow it all of your worship.
1617   <S {Leon}.> All thy tediousnesse on me, ah?
1618  *<S {Const.Dog}.> Yea, #and 'twere a thousand times more
1619  *than 'tis, for I heare as good exclamation on your Wor-ship
1620  *as of any man in the Citie, and though I bee but a
1621   poore man, I am glad to heare it.
1622   <S {Head}.> And so am I.
1623   <S {Leon}.> I would faine know what you haue to say.
1624  *<S {Head}.> Marry sir our watch to night, excepting your
1625  *worships presence, haue tane a couple of as arrant
1626   knaues as any in Messina.
1627  *<S {Con.Dog}.> A good old man sir, hee will be talking as
1628  *they say, when the age is in, the wit is out, God helpe vs,
1629  *it is a world to see: well said yfaith neighbour {Verges},
1630  *well, God's a good man, #and two men ride of a horse,
1631  *one must ride behinde, an honest soule yfaith sir, by my
1632  *troth he is, as euer broke bread, but God is to bee wor-shipt,
1633  *all men are not alike, alas good neighbour.
1634   <S {Leon}.> Indeed neighbour he comes too short of you.
1635   <S {Con.Do}.> Gifts that God giues.
1636   <S {Leon}.> I must leaue you.
1637  *<S {Con.Dog}.> One word sir, our watch sir haue indeede
1638  *comprehended two aspitious persons, & we would haue
1639   them this morning examined before your worship.
1640   <S {Leon}.> Take their examination your selfe, and bring it
1641   me, I am now in great haste, as may appeare vnto you.
1642   <S {Const}.> It shall be suffigance.
1643  *<S {Leon}.> Drinke some wine ere you goe: fare you well. |(<D {Exit}.>
1644  *<S {Messenger}.> My Lord, they stay for you to giue your
1645   daughter to her husband.
1646   <S {Leon}.> Ile wait vpon them, I am ready.
1647  *<S {Dogb}.> Goe good partner, goe get you to {Francis Sea-coale},
1648  *bid him bring his pen and inkehorne to the Gaole:
1649   we are now to examine those men.
1650   <S {Verges}.> And we must doe it wisely.
1651  *<S {Dogb}.> Wee will spare for no witte I warrant you:
      <P K3v>
1652  *heere's that shall driue some to a non- come, on-ly
1653  *get the learned writer to set downe our excommuni-cation,
1654   and meet me at the Iaile.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1655   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1656  *<D {Enter Prince, Bastard, Leonato, Frier, Claudio, Benedicke},
1657   {#Hero, and Beatrice}.>
1658  *<S {Leonato}.> Come Frier {Francis}, be briefe, onely to the
1659  *plaine forme of marriage, and you shal recount their par-ticular
1660   duties afterwards.
1661  *<S {Fran}.> You come hither, my Lord, to marry this Lady.
1662   <S {Clau}.> No.
1663  *<S {Leo}.> To be married to her: Frier, you come to mar-rie
1664   her.
1665  *<S {Frier}.> Lady, you come hither to be married to this
1666   Count.
1667   <S {Hero}.> I doe.
1668  *<S {Frier}.> If either of you know any inward impediment
1669  *why you should not be conioyned, I charge you on your
1670   soules to vtter it.
1671   <S {Claud}.> Know you anie, {Hero}?
1672   <S {Hero}.> None my Lord.
1673   <S {Frier}.> Know you anie, Count?
1674   <S {Leon}.> I dare make his answer, None.
1675  *<S {Clau}.> O what men dare do! what men may do! what
1676   men daily do!
1677  *<S {Bene}.> How now! interiections? why then, some be
1678   of laughing, as ha, ha, #he.
1679   <S {Clau}.> Stand thee by Frier, father, by your leaue,
1680   Will you with free and vnconstrained soule
1681   Giue me this maid your daughter?
1682   <S {Leon}.> As freely sonne as God did giue her me.
1683  *<S {Cla}.> And what haue I to giue you back, whose worth
1684   May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
1685   <S {Prin}.> Nothing, vnlesse you render her againe.
1686  *<S {Clau}.> Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:
1687   There {Leonato}, take her backe againe,
1688   Giue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,
1689   Shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:
1690   Behold how like a maid she blushes heere!
1691   O what authoritie and shew of truth
1692   Can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!
1693   Comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,
1694   To witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare
1695   All you that see her, that she were a maide,
1696   By these exterior shewes? But she is none:
1697   She knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:
1698   Her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie.
1699   <S {Leonato}.> What doe you meane, my Lord?
1700   <S {Clau}.> Not to be married,
1701   Not to knit my soule to an approued wanton.
1702   <S {Leon}.> Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,
1703   Haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,
1704   And made defeat of her virginitie.
1705  *<S {Clau}.> I know what you would say: if I haue knowne
1706   (her,
1707   You will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,
1708   And so extenuate the forehand sinne: No {Leonato},
1709   I neuer tempted her with word too large,
1710   But as a brother to his sister, shewed
1711   Bashfull sinceritie and comely loue.
1712   <S {Hero}.> And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?
1713   <S {Clau}.> Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,
1714   You seeme to me as {Diane} in her Orbe,
1715   As chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:
1716   But you are more intemperate in your blood,
1717   Than {Venus}, or those pampred animalls,
1718   That rage in sauage sensualitie.
1719  *<S {Hero}.> Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?
1720   <S {Leon}.> Sweete Prince, why speake not you?
1721   <S {Prin}.> What should I speake?
1722   I stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,
1723   To linke my deare friend to a common stale.
1724  *<S {Leon}.> Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?
1725   <S {Bast}.> Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
1726   <S {Bene}.> This lookes not like a nuptiall.
1727   <S {Hero}.> True, O God!
1728   <S {Clau}.> {Leonato}, stand I here?
1729   Is this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?
1730   Is this face {Heroes}? are our eies our owne?
1731   <S {Leon}.> All this is so, but what of this my Lord?
1732  *<S {Clau}.> Let me but moue one question to your daugh-|(ter,
1733   And by that fatherly and kindly power,
1734   That you haue in her, bid her answer truly.
1735   <S {Leo}.> I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe.
1736   <S {Hero}.> O God defend me how am I beset,
1737   What kinde of catechizing call you this?
1738   <S {Clau}.> To make you answer truly to your name.
1739   <S {Hero}.> Is it not {Hero}? who can blot that name
1740   With any iust reproach?
1741   <S {Claud}.> Marry that can {Hero},
1742   {#Hero} it selfe can blot out {Heroes} vertue.
1743   What man was he, talkt with you yesternight,
1744   Out at your window betwixt twelue and one?
1745   Now if you are a maid, answer to this.
1746   <S {Hero}.> I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord.
1747   <S {Prince}.> Why then you are no maiden. {Leonato},
1748   I am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,
1749   My selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count
1750   Did see her, heare her, at that howre last night,
1751   Talke with a ruffian at her chamber window,
1752   Who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,
1753   Confest the vile encounters they haue had
1754   A thousand times in secret.
1755   <S {Iohn}.> Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,
1756   Not to be spoken of,
1757   There is not chastitie enough in language,
1758   Without offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady
1759   I am sorry for thy much misgouernment.
1760   <S {Claud}.> O {Hero}! what a {Hero} hadst thou beene
1761   If halfe thy outward graces had beene placed
1762   About thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?
1763   But fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell
1764   Thou pure impiety, and impious puritie,
1765   For thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,
1766   And on my eie- lids shall Coniecture hang,
1767   To turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,
1768   And neuer shall it more be gracious.
1769   <S {Leon}.> Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?
1770  *<S {Beat}.> Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?
1771  *<S {Bast}.> Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,
1772   Smother her spirits vp.
1773   <S {Bene}.> How doth the Lady?
1774   <S {Beat}.> Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,
1775   {#Hero}, why {Hero}, Vncle, Signor {Benedicke}, Frier.
1776   <S {Leonato}.> O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,
1777   Death is the fairest couer for her shame
1778   That may be wisht for.
      <P K4><C B>
1779   <S {Beatr}.> How now cosin {Hero}?
1780   <S {Fri}.> Haue comfort Ladie.
1781   <S {Leon}.> Dost thou looke vp?
1782   <S {Frier}.> Yea, wherefore should she not?
1783  *<S {Leon}.> Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing
1784   Cry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie
1785   The storie that is printed in her blood?
1786   Do not liue {Hero}, do not ope thine eyes:
1787   For did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,
1788   Thought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,
1789   My selfe would on the reward of reproaches
1790   Strike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?
1791   Chid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?
1792   O one too much by thee: why had I one?
1793   Why euer was't thou louelie in my eies?
1794   Why had I not with charitable hand
1795   Tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,
1796   Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,
1797   I might haue said, no part of it is mine:
1798   This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,
1799   But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,
1800   And mine that I was proud on mine so much,
1801   That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:
1802   Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne
1803   Into a pit of Inke, that the wide sea
1804   Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,
1805   And salt too little, which may season giue
1806   To her foule tainted flesh.
1807  *<S {Ben}.> Sir, sir, be patient: for my part, I am so attired
1808   in wonder, I know not what to say.
1809   <S {Bea}.> O on my soule my cosin is belied.
1810   <S {Ben}.> Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?
1811   <S {Bea}.> No, truly: not although vntill last night,
1812   I haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow.
1813  *<S {Leon}.> Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made
1814   Which was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.
1815   Would the Princes lie, and {Claudio} lie,
1816   Who lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,
1817   Wash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die.
1818  *<S {Fri}.> Heare me a little, for I haue onely bene silent so
1819  *long, and giuen way vnto this course of fortune, by no-ting
1820   of the Ladie, I haue markt.
1821   A thousand blushing apparitions,
1822   To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,
1823   In Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,
1824   And in her eie there hath appear'd a fire
1825   To burne the errors that these Princes hold
1826   Against her maiden truth. Call me a foole,
1827   Trust not my reading, nor my obseruations,
1828   Which with experimental seale doth warrant
1829   The tenure of my booke: trust not my age,
1830   My reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,
1831   If this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,
1832   Vnder some biting error.
1833   <S {Leo}.> Friar, it cannot be:
1834   Thou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,
1835   Is, that she wil not adde to her damnation,
1836   A sinne of periury, she not denies it:
1837   Why seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,
1838   That which appeares in proper nakednesse?
1839   <S {Fri}.> Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?
1840  *<S {Hero}.> They know that do accuse me, I know none:
1841   If I know more of any man aliue
1842   Then that which maiden modestie doth warrant,
1843   Let all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,
1844   Proue you that any man with me conuerst,
1845   At houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight
1846   Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
1847   Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.
1848  *<S {Fri}.> There is some strange misprision in the Princes.
1849   <S {Ben}.> Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,
1850   And if their wisedomes be misled in this:
1851   The practise of it liues in {Iohn} the bastard,
1852   Whose spirits toile in frame of villanies.
1853   <S {Leo}.> I know not: if they speake but truth of her,
1854  *These hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,
1855   The proudest of them shall wel heare of it.
1856   Time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,
1857   Nor age so eate vp my inuention,
1858   Nor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,
1859   Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
1860   But they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,
1861   Both strength of limbe, and policie of minde,
1862   Ability in meanes, and choise of friends,
1863   To quit me of them throughly.
1864   <S {Fri}.> Pause awhile:
1865   And let my counsell sway you in this case,
1866   Your daughter heere the Princesse (left for dead)
1867   Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
1868   And publish it, that she is dead indeed:
1869   Maintaine a mourning ostentation,
1870   And on your Families old monument,
1871   Hang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,
1872   That appertaine vnto a buriall.
1873  *<S {Leon}.> What shall become of this? What wil this do?
1874   <S {Fri}.> Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,
1875   Change slander to remorse, that is some good,
1876   But not for that dreame I on this strange course,
1877   But on this trauaile looke for greater birth:
1878   She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
1879   Vpon the instant that she was accus'd,
1880   Shal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd
1881   Of euery hearer: for it so fals out,
1882   That what we haue, we prize not to the worth,
1883   Whiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,
1884   Why then we racke the value, then we finde
1885   The vertue that possession would not shew vs
1886   Whiles it was ours, so will it fare with {Claudio}:
1887   When he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,
1888   Th' Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe
1889   Into his study of imagination.
1890   And euery louely Organ of her life,
1891   Shall come apparel'd in more precious habite:
1892   More mouing delicate, and ful of life,
1893   Into the eye and prospect of his soule
1894   Then when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,
1895   If euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,
1896   And wish he had not so accused her:
1897   No, though he thought his accusation true:
1898   Let this be so, and doubt not but successe
1899   Wil fashion the euent in better shape,
1900   Then I can lay it downe in likelihood.
1901   But if all ayme but this be leuelld false,
1902   The supposition of the Ladies death,
1903   Will quench the wonder of her infamie.
1904   And if it sort not well, you may conceale her
1905   As best befits her wounded reputation,
1906   In some reclusiue and religious life,
1907   Out of all eyes, tongues, mindes and iniuries.
1908   <S {Bene}.> Signior {Leonato}, let the Frier aduise you,
1909   And though you know my inwardnesse and loue
1910   Is very much vnto the Prince and {Claudio}.
      <P K4v><C C>
1911   Yet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,
1912   As secretly and iustlie, as your soule
1913   Should with your bodie.
1914   <S {Leon}.> Being that I flow in greefe,
1915   The smallest twine may lead me.
1916   <S {Frier}.> 'Tis well consented, presently away,
1917   For to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,
1918   Come Lady, die to liue, this wedding day
1919  *Perhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience & endure.  <D {Exit}.>
1920   <S {Bene}.> Lady {Beatrice}, haue you wept all this while?
1921   <S {Beat}.> Yea, and I will weepe #a while longer.
1922   <S {Bene}.> I will not desire that.
1923   <S {Beat}.> You haue no reason, I doe it freely.
1924  *<S {Bene}.> Surelie I do beleeue your fair cosin is wrong'd.
1925  *<S {Beat}.> Ah, how much might the man deserue of mee
1926   that would right her!
1927   <S {Bene}.> Is there any way to shew such friendship?
1928   <S {Beat}.> A verie euen way, but no such friend.
1929   <S {Bene}.> May a man doe it?
1930   <S {Beat}.> It is a mans office, but not yours.
1931  *<S {Bene}.> I doe loue nothing in the world so well as you,
1932   is not that strange?
1933  *<S {Beat}.> As strange as the thing I know not, it were as
1934  *possible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but
1935  *beleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor
1936   I deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin.
1937   <S {Bene}.> By my sword {Beatrice} thou lou'st me.
1938   <S {Beat}.> Doe not sweare by it and eat it.
1939  *<S {Bene}.> I will sweare by it that you loue mee, and I will
1940   make him eat it that sayes I loue not you.
1941   <S {Beat}.> Will you not eat your word?
1942  *<S {Bene}.> With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I pro-test
1943   I loue thee.
1944   <S {Beat}.> Why then God forgiue me.
1945   <S {Bene}.> What offence sweet Beatrice?
1946  *<S {Beat}.> You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was a-bout
1947   to protest I loued you.
1948   <S {Bene}.> And doe it with all thy heart.
1949  *<S {Beat}.> I loue you with so much of my heart, that none
1950   is left to protest.
1951   <S {Bened}.> Come, bid me doe any thing for thee.
1952   <S {Beat}.> Kill {Claudio}.
1953   <S {Bene}.> Ha, not for the wide world.
1954   <S {Beat}.> You kill me to denie, farewell.
1955   <S {Bene}.> Tarrie sweet {Beatrice}.
1956  *<S {Beat}.> I am gone, though I am heere, there is no loue
1957   in you, nay I pray you let me goe.
1958   <S {Bene}.> {Beatrice}.
1959   <S {Beat}.> Infaith I will goe.
1960   <S {Bene}.> Wee'll be friends first.
1961  *<S {Beat}.> You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight
1962   with mine enemy.
1963   <S {Bene}.> Is {Claudio} thine enemie?
1964  *<S {Beat}.> Is #a not approued in the height a villaine, that
1965  *hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
1966  *that I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they
1967  *come to take hands, and then with publike accusation
1968  *vncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that I
1969   were a man! I would eat his heart in the market- place.
1970   <S {Bene}.> Heare me {Beatrice}.
1971  *<S {Beat}.> Talke with a man out at a window, a proper
1972   saying.
1973   <S {Bene}.> Nay but {Beatrice}.
1974  *<S {Beat}.> Sweet {Hero}, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,
1975   she is vndone.
1976   <S {Bene}.> Beat?
1977  *<S {Beat}.> Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testi-monie,
1978  *a goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant sure-lie,
1979  *O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any
1980  *friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is mel-ted
1981  *into cursies, valour into complement, and men are
1982  *onelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now
1983  *as valiant as {Hercules}, that only tells a lie, and sweares it:
1984  *I cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I will die a wo-man
1985   with grieuing.
1986   <S {Bene}.> Tarry good {Beatrice}, by this hand I loue thee.
1987  *<S {Beat}.> Vse it for my loue some other way then swea-ring
1988   by it.
1989  *<S {Bened}.> Thinke you in your soule the Count {Claudio}
1990   hath wrong'd {Hero}?
1991   <S {Beat}.> Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule.
1992  *<S {Bene}.> Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him, I
1993  *will kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand {Clau-dio}
1994  *shall render me a deere account: as you heare of me,
1995  *so thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say she
1996   is dead, and so farewell.
1997   <D {Enter the Constables, Borachio, and the Towne Clerke}
1998   {in gownes}.>
1999   <S {Keeper}.> Is our whole dissembly appeard?
2000   <S {Cowley}.> O a stoole and a cushion for the Sexton.
2001   <S {Sexton}.> Which be the malefactors?
2002   <S {Andrew}.> Marry that am I, and my partner.
2003  *<S {Cowley}.> Nay that's certaine, wee haue the exhibition
2004   to examine.
2005  *<S {Sexton}.> But which are the offenders that are to be ex-amined,
2006   let them come before master Constable.
2007  *<S {Kemp}.> Yea marry, let them come before mee, what is
2008   your name, friend?
2009   <S {Bor}.> {Borachio}.
2010   <S {Kem}.> Pray write downe {Borachio}. Yours sirra.
2011   <S {Con}.> I am a Gentleman sir, and my name is {Conrade}.
2012  *<S {Kee}.> Write downe Master gentleman {Conrade}: mai-sters,
2013  *doe you serue God: maisters, it is proued alreadie
2014  *that you are little better than false knaues, and it will goe
2015  *neere to be thought so shortly, how answer you for your
2016   selues?
2017   <S {Con}.> Marry sir, we say we are none.
2018  *<S {Kemp}.> A maruellous witty fellow I assure you, but I
2019  *will goe about with him: come you hither sirra, a word
2020  *in your eare sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false
2021   knaues.
2022   <S {Bor}.> Sir, I say to you, we are none.
2023  *<S {Kemp}.> Well, stand aside, 'fore God they are both in
2024   a tale: haue you writ downe that they are none?
2025  *<S {Sext}.> Master Constable, you goe not the way to ex-amine,
2026  *you must call forth the watch that are their ac-cusers.
2027  _
2028  *<S {Kemp}.> Yea marry, that's the eftest way, let the watch
2029  *come forth: masters, I charge you in the Princes name,
2030   accuse these men.
2031  *<S {Watch} 1.> This man said sir, that {#Don Iohn} the Princes
2032   brother was a villaine.
2033  *<S {Kemp}.> Write down, Prince {Iohn} a villaine: why this
2034   is flat periurie, to call a Princes brother villaine.
2035   <S {Bora}.> Master Constable.
2036  *<S {Kemp}.> Pray thee fellow peace, I do not like thy looke
2037   I promise thee.
2038   <S {Sexton}.> What heard you him say else?
2039  *<S {Watch} 2.> Mary that he had receiued a thousand Du-kates
2040  *of {#Don Iohn}, for accusing the Lady {Hero} wrong-fully.
2041  _
      <P K5>
2042   <S {Kemp}.> Flat Burglarie as euer was committed.
2043   <S {Const}.> Yea by th' masse that it is.
2044   <S {Sexton}.> What else fellow?
2045  *<S {Watch} 1.> And that Count {Claudio} did meane vpon his
2046  *words, to disgrace {Hero} before the whole assembly, and
2047   not marry her.
2048  *<S {Kemp}.> O villaine! thou wilt be condemn'd into euer-lasting
2049   redemption for this.
2050   <S {Sexton}.> What else?
2051   <S {Watch}.> This is all.
2052  *<S {Sexton}.> And this is more masters then you can deny,
2053  *Prince {Iohn} is this morning secretly stolne away: {Hero}
2054  *was in this manner accus'd, in this very manner refus'd,
2055  *and vpon the griefe of this sodainely died: Master Con-stable,
2056  *let these men be bound, and brought to {Leonato},
2057   I will goe before, and shew him their examination.
2058   <S {Const}.> Come, let them be opinion'd.
2059   <S {Sex}.> Let them be in the hands of {Coxcombe}.
2060  *<S {Kem}.> Gods my life, where's the Sexton? let him write
2061  *downe the Princes Officer {Coxcombe}: come, binde them
2062   thou naughty varlet.
2063   <S {Couley}.> Away, you are an asse, you are an asse.
2064  *<S {Kemp}.> Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
2065  *suspect my yeeres? O that hee were heere to write mee
2066  *downe an asse! but masters, remember that I am an asse:
2067  *though it be not written down, yet forget not y I am an
2068  *asse: No thou villaine, y art full of piety as shall be prou'd
2069  *vpon thee by good witnesse, I am a wise fellow, and
2070  *which is more, an officer, and which is more, a houshoul-der,
2071  *and which is more, as pretty a peece of flesh as any in
2072  *Messina, and one that knowes the Law, goe to, & a rich
2073  *fellow enough, goe to, and a fellow that hath had losses,
2074  *and one that hath two gownes, and euery thing hand-some
2075  *about him: bring him away: O that I had been writ
2076   downe an asse!  <D {Exit}.>
2077   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2078   <D {Enter Leonato and his brother}.>
2079   <S {Brother}.> If you goe on thus, you will kill your selfe,
2080   And 'tis not wisedome thus to second griefe,
2081   Against your selfe.
2082   <S {Leon}.> I pray thee cease thy counsaile,
2083   Which falls into mine eares as profitlesse,
2084   As water in a siue: giue not me counsaile,
2085   Nor let no comfort delight mine eare,
2086   But such a one whose wrongs doth sute with mine.
2087   Bring me a father that so lou'd his childe,
2088   Whose ioy of her is ouer- whelmed like mine,
2089   And bid him speake of patience,
2090   Measure his woe the length and bredth of mine,
2091   And let it answere euery straine for straine,
2092   As thus for thus, and such a griefe for such,
2093   In euery lineament, branch, shape, and forme:
2094   If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
2095   And sorrow, wagge, crie hem, when he should grone,
2096   Patch griefe with prouerbs, make misfortune drunke,
2097   With candle- wasters: bring him yet to me,
2098   And I of him will gather patience:
2099   But there is no such man, for brother, men
2100   Can counsaile, and speake comfort to that griefe,
2101   Which they themselues not feele, but tasting it,
2102   Their counsaile turnes to passion, which before,
2103   Would giue preceptiall medicine to rage,
2104   Fetter strong madnesse in a silken thred,
2105   Charme ache with ayre, and agony with words,
2106   No, no, 'tis all mens office, to speake patience
2107   To those that wring vnder the load of sorrow:
2108   But no mans vertue nor sufficiencie
2109   To be so morall, when he shall endure
2110   The like himselfe: therefore giue me no counsaile,
2111   My griefs cry lowder then aduertisement.
2112  *<S {Broth}.> Therein do men from children nothing differ.
2113  *<S {Leonato}.> I pray thee peace, I will be flesh and bloud,
2114   For there was neuer yet Philosopher,
2115   That could endure the tooth- ake patiently,
2116   How euer they haue writ the stile of gods,
2117   And made a push at chance and sufferance.
2118  *<S {Brother}.> Yet bend not all the harme vpon your selfe,
2119   Make those that doe offend you, suffer too.
2120   <S {Leon}.> There thou speak'st reason, nay I will doe so,
2121   My soule doth tell me, {Hero} is belied,
2122   And that shall {Claudio} know, so shall the Prince,
2123   And all of them that thus dishonour her.
2124   <D {Enter Prince and Claudio}.>
2125   <S {Brot}.> Here comes the {Prince} and {Claudio} hastily.
2126   <S {Prin}.> Good den, good den.
2127   <S {Clau}.>  Good day to both of you.
2128   <S {Leon}.> Heare you my Lords?
2129   <S {Prin}.> We haue some haste {Leonato}.
2130  *<S {Leo}.> Some haste my Lord! wel, fareyouwel   my Lord,
2131   Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
2132   <S {Prin}.> Nay, do not quarrel with vs, good old man.
2133   <S {Brot}.> If he could rite himselfe with quarrelling,
2134   Some of vs would lie low.
2135   <S {Claud}.> Who wrongs him?
2136  *<S {Leon}.> Marry y dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou:
2137   Nay, neuer lay thy hand vpon thy sword,
2138   I feare thee not.
2139   <S {Claud}.> Marry beshrew my hand,
2140   If it should giue your age such cause of feare,
2141   Infaith   my hand meant nothing to my sword.
2142  *<S {Leonato}.> Tush, tush, man, neuer fleere and iest at me,
2143   I speake not like a dotard, nor a foole,
2144   As vnder priuiledge of age to bragge,
2145   What I haue done being yong, or what would doe,
2146   Were I not old, know {Claudio} to thy head,
2147   Thou hast so wrong'd my innocent childe and me,
2148   That I am forc'd to lay my reuerence by,
2149   And with grey haires and bruise of many daies,
2150   Doe challenge thee to triall of a man,
2151   I say thou hast belied mine innocent childe.
2152   Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
2153   And she lies buried with her ancestors:
2154   O in a tombe where neuer scandall slept,
2155   Saue this of hers, fram'd by thy villanie.
2156   <S {Claud}.> My villany?
2157   <S {Leonato}.> Thine {Claudio}, thine I say.
2158   <S {Prin}.> You say not right old man.
2159   <S {Leon}.> My Lord, my Lord,
2160   Ile proue it on his body if he dare,
2161   Despight his nice fence, and his actiue practise,
2162   His #Maie of youth, and bloome of lustihood.
2163   <S {Claud}.> Away, I will not haue to do with you.
2164  *<S {Leo}.> Canst thou so daffe me? thou hast kild my child,
2165   If thou kilst me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
2166   <S {Bro}.> He shall kill two of vs, and men indeed,
2167   But that's no matter, let him kill one first:
      <P K5v><C D>
2168   Win me and weare me, let him answere me,
2169   Come follow me boy, come sir boy, come follow me
2170   Sir boy, ile whip you from your foyning fence,
2171   Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
2172   <S {Leon}.> Brother.
2173  *<S {Brot}.> Content your self, God knows I lou'd my neece,
2174   And she is dead, slander'd to death by villaines,
2175   That dare as well answer a man indeede,
2176   As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
2177   Boyes, apes, braggarts,   Iackes, milke- sops.
2178   <S {Leon}.> Brother {Anthony}.
2179  *<S {Brot}.> Hold you content, what man? I know them, yea
2180   And what they weigh, euen to the vtmost scruple,
2181   Scambling, out- facing, fashion- monging boyes,
2182   That lye, and cog, and flout, depraue, and slander,
2183   Goe antiquely, and show outward hidiousnesse,
2184   And speake of halfe a dozen dang'rous words,
2185   How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst.
2186   And this is all.
2187   <S {Leon}.> But brother {Anthonie}.
2188   <S {Ant}.> Come, 'tis no matter,
2189   Do not you meddle, let me deale in this.
2190  *<S {Pri}.> Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience
2191   My heart is sorry for your daughters death:
2192   But on my honour she was charg'd with nothing
2193   But what was true, and very full of proofe.
2194   <S {Leon}.> My Lord, my Lord.
2195   <S {Prin}.> I will not heare you.
2196   <D {Enter Benedicke}.>
2197   <S {Leo}.> No come brother, away, I will be heard.
2198   <D {Exeunt ambo}.>
2199   <S {Bro}.> And shall, or some of vs will smart for it.
2200  *<S {Prin}.> See, see, here comes the man we went to seeke.
2201   <S {Clau}.> Now signior, what newes?
2202   <S {Ben}.> Good day my Lord.
2203  *<S {Prin}.> Welcome signior, you are almost come to part
2204   almost a fray.
2205  *<S {Clau}.> Wee had likt to haue had our two noses snapt
2206   off with two old men without teeth.
2207  *<S {Prin}.> {Leonato} and his brother, what think'st thou? had
2208  *wee fought, I doubt we should haue beene too yong for
2209   them.
2210  *<S {Ben}.> In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I came
2211   to seeke you both.
2212  *<S {Clau}.> We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for
2213  *we are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it
2214   beaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?
2215   <S {Ben}.> It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?
2216   <S {Prin}.> Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?
2217  *<S {Clau}.> Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been
2218  *beside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the min-strels,
2219   draw to pleasure vs.
2220  *<S {Prin}.> As I am an honest man he lookes pale, art thou
2221   sicke, or angrie?
2222  *<S {Clau}.> What, courage man: what though care kil'd a
2223   cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
2224  *<S {Ben}.> Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, #and
2225  *you charge it against me, I pray you chuse another sub-iect.
2226  _
2227  *<S {Clau}.> Nay then giue him  another staffe, this last was
2228   broke crosse.
2229  *<S {Prin}.> By this light, he changes more and more, I thinke
2230   he be angrie indeede.
2231   <S {Clau}.> If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle.
2232   <S {Ben}.> Shall I speake a word in your eare?
2233   <S {Clau}.> God blesse me from a challenge.
2234  *<S {Ben}.> You are a villaine, I iest not, I will make it good
2235  *how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare:
2236  *do me right, or I will protest your cowardise: you haue
2237  *kill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death shall fall heauie on
2238   you, let me heare from you.
2239  *<S {Clau}.> Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good
2240   cheare.
2241   <S {Prin}.> What, a feast, a feast?
2242  *<S {Clau}.> #I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues
2243  *head and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most cu-riously,
2244  *say my knife's naught, shall I not finde a wood-cocke
2245   too?
2246   <S {Ben}.> Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily.
2247  *<S {Prin}.> Ile tell thee how {Beatrice} prais'd thy wit the o-ther
2248  *day: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she, a fine
2249  *little one: no said I, a great wit: right saies shee, a great
2250  *grosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust said she, it hurts
2251  *no body: nay said I, the gentleman is wise: certaine said
2252  *she, a wise gentleman: nay said I, he hath the tongues:
2253  *that I beleeue said shee, for hee swore a thing to me on
2254  *munday night, which he forswore on tuesday morning:
2255  *there's a double tongue, there's two tongues: thus did
2256  *shee an howre together trans- shape thy particular ver-tues,
2257  *yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the
2258   proprest man in Italie.
2259  *<S {Claud}.> For the which she wept heartily, and said shee
2260   car'd not.
2261  *<S {Prin}.> Yea that she did, but yet for all that, #and if shee
2262  *did not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,
2263   the old mans daughter told vs all.
2264  *<S {Clau}.> All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he
2265   was hid in the garden.
2266  *<S {Prin}.> But when shall we set the sauage Bulls hornes
2267   on the sensible {Benedicks} head?
2268  *<S {Clau}.> Yea and text vnder-neath, heere dwells {Bene-dicke}
2269   the married man.
2270  *<S {Ben}.> Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will
2271  *leaue you now to your gossep- like humor, you breake
2272  *iests as braggards do their blades, which God be thank-ed
2273  *hurt not: my Lord, for your manie courtesies I thank
2274  *you, I must discontinue your companie, your brother
2275  *the Bastard is fled from {Messina}: you haue among you,
2276  *kill'd a sweet and innocent Ladie: for my Lord Lacke-beard
2277  *there, he and I shall meete, and till then peace be
2278   with him.
2279   <S {Prin}.> He is in earnest.
2280  *<S {Clau}.> In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant you,
2281   for the loue of Beatrice.
2282   <S {Prin}.> And hath challeng'd thee.
2283   <S {Clau}.> Most sincerely.
2284  *<S {Prin}.> What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in his
2285   doublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.
2286   <D {Enter Constable, Conrade, and Borachio}.>
2287  *<S {Clau}.> He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape
2288   a Doctor to such a man.
2289  *<S {Prin}.> But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart, and
2290   be sad, did he not say my brother was fled?
2291  *<S {Const}.> Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee
2292  *shall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, #and
2293   you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to.
2294  *<S {Prin}.> How now, two of my brothers men bound? {Bo-rachio}
2295   one.
2296   <S {Clau}.> Harken after their offence my Lord.
2297   <S {Prin}.> Officers, what offence haue these men done?
      <P K6>
2298  *<S {Const}.> Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,
2299  *moreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they
2300  *are slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,
2301  *thirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude
2302   they are lying knaues.
2303  *<S {Prin}.> First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie
2304  *I aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why they
2305  *are committed, and to conclude, what you lay to their
2306   charge.
2307  *<S {Clau}.> Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and
2308   by my troth there's one meaning well suted.
2309  *<S {Prin}.> Who haue you offended masters, that you are
2310  *thus bound to your answer? this learned Constable is too
2311   cunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?
2312  *<S {Bor}.> Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine an-swere:
2313  *do you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I
2314  *haue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wise-domes
2315  *could not discouer, these shallow fooles haue
2316  *brought to light, who in the night ouerheard me con-fessing
2317  *to this man, how {#Don Iohn} your brother incensed
2318  *me to slander the Ladie {Hero}, how you were brought
2319  *into the Orchard, and saw me court {Margaret} in {Heroes}
2320  *garments, how you disgrac'd her when you should
2321  *marrie her: my villanie they haue vpon record, which
2322  *I had rather seale with my death, then repeate ouer to
2323  *my shame: the Ladie is dead vpon mine and my masters
2324  *false accusation: and briefelie, I desire nothing but the
2325   reward of a villaine.
2326  *<S {Prin}.> Runs not this speech like yron through your
2327   bloud?
2328   <S {Clau}.> I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it.
2329   <S {Prin}.> But did my Brother set thee on to this?
2330   <S {Bor}.> Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
2331   <S {Prin}.> He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,
2332   And fled he is vpon this villanie.
2333   <S {Clau}.> Sweet {Hero}, now thy image doth appeare
2334   In the rare semblance that I lou'd it first.
2335  *<S {Const}.> Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time
2336  *our {Sexton} hath reformed {Signior Leonato} of the matter:
2337  *and masters, do not forget to specifie when time & place
2338   shall serue, that I am an Asse.
2339  *<S {Con}.2.> Here, here comes master {Signior Leonato}, and
2340   the {Sexton} too.
2341   <D {Enter Leonato}.>
2342   <S {Leon}.> Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,
2343   That when I note another man like him,
2344   I may auoide him: which of these is he?
2345  *<S {Bor}.> If you would know your wronger, looke on me.
2346  *<S {Leon}.> Art   thou the slaue that with thy breath
2347   hast kild mine innocent childe?
2348   <S {Bor}.> Yea, euen I alone.
2349   <S {Leo}.> No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,
2350   Here stand a paire of honourable men,
2351   A third is fled that had a hand in it:
2352   I thanke you Princes for my daughters death,
2353   Record it with your high and worthie deedes,
2354   'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it.
2355   <S {Clau}.> I know not how to pray your patience,
2356   Yet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,
2357   Impose me to what penance your inuention
2358   Can lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,
2359   But in mistaking.
2360   <S {Prin}.> By my soule nor I,
2361   And yet to satisfie this good old man,
2362   I would bend vnder anie heauie waight,
2363   That heele enioyne me to.
2364   <S {Leon}.> I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,
2365   That were impossible, but I praie you both,
2366   Possesse the people in {Messina} here,
2367   How innocent she died, and if your loue
2368   Can labour aught in sad inuention,
2369   Hang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,
2370   And sing it to her bones, sing it to night:
2371   To morrow morning come you to my house,
2372   And since you could not be my sonne in law,
2373   Be yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
2374   Almost the copie of my childe that's dead,
2375   And she alone is heire to both of vs,
2376   Giue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,
2377   And so dies my reuenge.
2378   <S {Clau}.> O noble sir!
2379   Your ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,
2380   I do embrace your offer, and dispose
2381   For henceforth of poore {Claudio}.
2382  *<S {Leon}.> To morrow then I will expect your comming,
2383   To night I take my leaue, this naughtie man
2384   Shall face to face be brought to {Margaret},
2385   Who I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,
2386   Hired to it by your brother.
2387   <S {Bor}.> No, by my soule she was not,
2388   Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
2389   But alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,
2390   In anie thing that I do know by her.
2391  *<S {Const}.> Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder white
2392  *and black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call mee
2393  *asse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his punish-ment,
2394  *and also the watch heard them talke of one Defor-med,
2395  *they say he weares a key in his eare and a lock hang-ing
2396  *by it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the which
2397  *he hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now men grow
2398  *hard- harted and will lend nothing for Gods sake: praie
2399   you examine him vpon that point.
2400   <S {Leon}.> I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines.
2401  *<S {Const}.> Your worship speakes like a most thankefull
2402   and reuerend youth, and I praise God for you.
2403   <S {Leon}.> There's for thy paines.
2404   <S {Const}.> God saue the foundation.
2405  *<S {Leon}.> Goe, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I
2406   thanke thee.
2407  *<S {Const}.> I leaue an arrant knaue with your worship,
2408  *which I beseech your worship to correct your selfe, for
2409  *the example of others: God keepe your worship, I
2410  *wish your worship well, God restore you to health,
2411  *I humblie giue you leaue to depart, and if a mer-rie
2412  *meeting may be wisht, God prohibite it: come
2413   neighbour.
2414   <S {Leon}.> Vntill to morrow morning, Lords, farewell.
2415   <D {Exeunt}.>
2416  *<S {Brot}.> Farewell my Lords, we looke   for you to mor-row.
2417  _
2418   <S {Prin}.> We will not faile.
2419   <S {Clau}.> To night ile mourne with {Hero}.
2420  *<S {Leon}.> Bring you these fellowes on, weel talke with
2421  *{Margaret}, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd
2422   fellow.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2423   <D {Enter Benedicke and Margaret}.>
2424  *<S {Ben}.> Praie thee sweete Mistris {Margaret}, deserue
2425  *well at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of {Bea-trice}.
2426  _
      <P K6v>
2427  *<S {Mar}.> Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of
2428   my beautie?
2429  *<S {Bene}.> In so high a stile {Margaret}, that no man liuing
2430  *shall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou deser-uest
2431   it.
2432  *<S {Mar}.> To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I al-waies
2433   keepe below staires?
2434  *<S {Bene}.> Thy wit is as  quicke as the grey- hounds mouth,
2435   it catches.
2436  *<S {Mar}.> And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which
2437   hit, but hurt not.
2438  *<S {Bene}.> A most manly wit {Margaret}, it will not hurt a
2439  *woman: and so I pray thee call {Beatrice}, I giue thee the
2440   bucklers.
2441  *<S {Mar}.> Giue vs the swords, wee haue bucklers of our
2442   owne.
2443  *<S {Bene}.> If you vse them {Margaret}, you must put in the
2444  *pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for
2445   Maides.
2446  *<S {Mar}.> Well, I will call  {Beatrice} to you, who I thinke
2447   hath legges. <D {Exit Margarite}.>
2448  *<S {Ben}.> And therefore will come. The God of loue that
2449  *sits aboue, and knowes me, and knowes me, how pitti-full
2450  *I deserue. I meane in singing, but in louing, Lean-der
2451  *the good swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of
2452  *pandars, and a whole booke full of these quondam car-pet- mongers,
2453  *whose name yet runne smoothly in the e-uen
2454  *rode of a blanke verse, why they were neuer so true-ly
2455  *turned ouer and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: mar-rie
2456  *I cannot shew it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no
2457  *rime to Ladie but babie, an innocent rime: for scorne,
2458  *horne, a hard rime: for schoole foole, a babling rime:
2459  *verie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder a ri-ming
2460  *Plannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:
2461   <D {Enter Beatrice}.>
2462  *sweete {Beatrice} would'st thou come when I cal'd
2463   thee?
2464   <S {Beat}.> Yea Signior, and depart when you bid me.
2465   <S {Bene}.> O stay but till then.
2466  *<S {Beat}.> Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet ere
2467  *I goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with know-ing
2468   what hath past betweene you and {Claudio}.
2469  *<S {Bene}.> Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse
2470   thee.
2471  *<S {Beat}.> Foule words is but foule wind, and foule wind
2472  *is but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, there-fore
2473   I will depart vnkist.
2474  *<S {Bene}.> Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
2475  *sence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,
2476  *{#Claudio} vndergoes my challenge, and either I must short-ly
2477  *heare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward, and
2478  *I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst
2479   thou first fall in loue with me?
2480  *<S {Beat}.> For them all together, which  maintain'd so
2481  *politique a state of euill, that they will not admit any
2482  *good part to intermingle with them: but for which of
2483   my good parts did you first suffer loue for  me?
2484  *<S {Bene}.> Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue in-deede,
2485   for I loue thee against my #will,
2486  *<S {Beat}.> In spight of your heart I think, alas poore heart,
2487  *if you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours, for
2488   I will neuer loue that which my friend hates.
2489  *<S {Bened}.> Thou and I are too wise to wooe peacea-blie.
2490  _
2491  *<S {Bea}.> It appeares not in this confession, there's not one
2492   wise man among twentie that will praise himselfe.
2493  *<S {Bene}.> An old, an old instance {Beatrice}, that liu'd in
2494  *the time of good neighbours, if a man doe not erect in
2495  *this age his owne tombe ere he dies, hee shall liue no
2496  *longer in monuments, then the Bels ring, & the Widdow
2497   weepes.
2498   <S {Beat}.> And how long is that thinke you?
2499  *<S {Ben}.> Question, why an hower in clamour and a quar-ter
2500  *in rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the wise,
2501  *if #Don worme (his conscience) finde no impediment to
2502  *the contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as
2503  *I am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I my
2504  *selfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell
2505   me, how doth your cosin?
2506   <S {Beat}.> Verie #ill.
2507   <S {Bene}.> And how doe you?
2508   <S {Beat}.> Verie #ill too.
2509   <D {Enter Vrsula}.>
2510  *<S {Bene}.> Serue God, loue me, and mend, there will I leaue
2511   you too, for here comes one in haste.

2554   <D {Enter Leonato, Bene. Marg. Vrsula, old man, Frier, Hero}.>
2555   <S {Frier}.> Did I not tell you she was innocent?
2556   <S {Leo}.> So are the {Prince} and {Claudio} who accus'd her,
2557   Vpon the errour that you heard debated:
2558   But {Margaret} was in some fault for this,
2559   Although against her #will as it appeares,
2560   In the true course of all the question.
2561   <S {Old}.> Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
2562   <S {Bene}.> And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
2563   To call young {Claudio} to a reckoning for it.
2564   <S {Leo}.> Well daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
2565   Withdraw into a chamber by your selues,
2566   And when I send for you, come hither mask'd:
2567   The {Prince} and {Claudio} promis'd by this howre
2568   To visit me, you know your office Brother,
2569   You must be father to your brothers daughter,
2570   And giue her to young {Claudio}.  <D {Exeunt Ladies}.>
2571  *<S {Old}.> Which I will doe with confirm'd countenance.
2572   <S {Bene}.> Frier, I must intreat your paines, I thinke.
2573   <S {Frier}.> To doe what Signior?
2574   <S {Bene}.> To binde me, or vndoe me, one of them:
2575   Signior {Leonato}, truth it is good Signior,
2576   Your neece regards me with an eye of fauour.
2577   <S {Leo}.> That eye my daughter lent her, 'tis most true.
2578   <S {Bene}.> And I doe with an eye of loue requite her.
2579   <S {Leo}.> The sight whereof I thinke you had from me,
2580   From {Claudio}, and the {Prince}, but what's your #will?
2581   <S {Bened}.> Your answer sir is Enigmaticall,
2582   But for my #will, my #will is, your good #will
2583   May stand with ours, this day to be conioyn'd,
2584   In the state of honourable marriage,
2585   In which (good Frier) I shall desire your helpe.
2586   <S {Leon}.> My heart is with your liking.
2587   <S {Frier}.> And my helpe.
2588   <D {Enter Prince and Claudio, with attendants}.>
2589   <S {Prin}.> Good morrow to this faire assembly.
2590   <S {Leo}.> Good morrow {Prince}, good morrow {Claudio}:
2591   We heere attend you, are you yet determin'd,
2592   To day to marry with my brothers daughter?
2593   <S {Claud}.> Ile hold my minde were she an Ethiope.
2594   <S {Leo}.> Call her forth brother, heres the Frier ready.
2595  *<S {Prin}.> Good morrow {Benedicke}, why what's the matter?
2596   That you haue such a Februarie face,
2597   So full of frost, of storme, and clowdinesse.
2598   <S {Claud}.> I thinke he thinkes vpon the sauage bull:
2599   Tush, feare not man, wee'll tip thy hornes with gold,
2600   And all Europa shall reioyce at thee,
2601   As once {Europa} did at lusty {Ioue},
2602   When he would play the noble beast in loue.
2603   <S {Ben}.> Bull {Ioue} sir, had an amiable low,
2604   And some such strange bull leapt your fathers Cow,
2605   #A got a Calfe in that same noble feat,
2606   Much like to you, for you haue iust his bleat.
2607   <D {Enter brother, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret,   Vrsula}.>
2608  *<S {Cla}.> For this I owe you: here comes other recknings.
2609   Which is the Lady I must seize vpon?
2610   <S {Leo}.> This same is she, and I doe giue you her.
2611  *<S {Cla}.> Why then she's mine, sweet let me see your face.
2612   <S {Leon}.> No that you shal not, till you take her hand,
2613   Before this Frier, and sweare to marry her.
2614   <S {Clau}.> Giue me your hand before this holy Frier,
2615   I am your husband if you like of me.
2616   <S {Hero}.> And when I liu'd I was your other wife,
2617   And when you lou'd, you were my other husband.
2618   <S {Clau}.> Another {Hero}?
2619   <S {Hero}.> Nothing certainer.
2620   One {Hero} died, but I doe liue,
2621   And surely as I liue, I am a maid.
2622   <S {Prin}.> The former {Hero}, {Hero} that is dead.
2623  *<S {Leon}.> Shee died my Lord, but whiles her slander liu'd.
2624   <S {Frier}.> All this amazement can I qualifie,
2625   When after that the holy rites are ended,
2626   Ile tell you largely of faire {Heroes} death:
2627   Meane time let wonder seeme familiar,
2628   And to the chappell let vs presently.
2629   <S {Ben}.> Soft and faire Frier, which is {Beatrice}?
2630   <S {Beat}.> I answer to that name, what is your #will?
2631   <S {Bene}.> Doe not you loue me?
2632   <S {Beat}.> Why no, no more then reason.
2633  *<S {Bene}.> Why then your Vncle, and the Prince, & {Clau-dio},
2634   haue beene deceiued, they swore you did.
2635   <S {Beat}.> Doe not you loue mee?
2636   <S {Bene}.> Troth no, no more then reason.
2637   <S {Beat}.> Why then my Cosin {Margaret} and {Vrsula}
2638   Are much deceiu'd, for they did sweare you did.
2639   <S {Bene}.> They swore you were almost sicke for me.
2640   <S {Beat}.> They swore you were wel- nye dead for me.
2641   <S {Bene}.> 'Tis no matter, then you doe not loue me?
2642   <S {Beat}.> No truly, but in friendly recompence.
2643  *<S {Leon}.> Come Cosin, I am sure you loue the gentlema[n].
2644   <S {Clau}.> And Ile be sworne vpon't, that he loues her,
2645   For heres a paper written in his hand,
2646   A halting sonnet of his owne pure braine,
2647   Fashioned to {Beatrice}.
2648   <S {Hero}.> And heeres another,
2649   Writ in my cosins hand, stolne from her pocket,
2650   Containing her affection vnto {Benedicke}.
2651  *<S {Bene}.> A miracle, here's our owne hands against our
2652  *hearts: come I will haue thee, but by this light I take
2653   thee for pittie.
2654  *<S {Beat}.> I would not denie you, but by this good day, I
2655  *yeeld vpon great perswasion, & partly to saue your life,
2656   for I was told, you were in a consumption.
2657   <S {Leon}.> Peace I will stop your mouth.
2658   <S {Prin}.> How dost thou {Benedicke} the married man?
2659  *<S {Bene}.> Ile tell thee what Prince: a Colledge of witte- crackers
2660  *cannot flout mee out of my humour, dost thou
2661  *think I care for a Satyre or an Epigram? no, if a man will
2662  *be beaten with braines, #a shall weare nothing handsome
2663  *about him: in briefe, since I do purpose to marry, I will
2664  *thinke nothing to any purpose that the world can say a-gainst
2665  *it, and therefore neuer flout at me, for I haue said
2666  *against it: for man is a giddy thing, and this is my con-clusion:
2667  *for thy part {Claudio}, I did thinke to haue beaten
2668  *thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, liue vn-bruis'd,
2669   and loue my cousin.
2670  *<S {Cla}.> I had well hop'd y wouldst haue denied {Beatrice}, y
2671  *I might haue cudgel'd thee out of thy single life, to make
2672  *thee a double dealer, which out of questio[n] thou wilt be,
2673  *if my Cousin do not looke exceeding narrowly to thee.
2674  *<S {Bene}.> Come, come, we are friends, let's haue a dance
2675  *ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts,
2676   and our wiues heeles.
2677   <S {Leon}.> Wee'll haue dancing afterward.
2678  *<S {Bene}.> First, of my word, therfore play musick. {Prince},
2679  *thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife, there is no
2680  *staff more reuerend then one tipt with horn.  <D {Enter. Mes}.>
2681  *<S {Messen}.> My Lord, your brother {Iohn} is tane in flight,
2682   And brought with armed men backe to {Messina}.
2683  *<S {Bene}.> Thinke not on him till to morrow, ile deuise
2684  *thee braue punishments for him: strike vp Pipers.  <D {Dance}.>
2685   <Z {FINIS}.
2686   Much adoe about Nothing.>
