122    <S {Bar}.> You Banbery Cheese.
123    <S {Slen}.> #I, it is no matter.
124    <S {Pist}.> How now, {Mephostophilus}?
125    <S {Slen}.> #I, it is no matter.
126   *<S {Nym}.> Slice, I say; {pauca}, {pauca}: Slice, that's my humor.
127   *<S {Slen}.> Where's {Simple} my man? can you tell, Cosen?
128   *<S {Eua}.> Peace, I pray you: now let vs vnderstand: there
129   *is three Vmpires in this matter, as I vnderstand; that is,
130   *Master {Page} (fidelicet Master {Page},) & there is my selfe,
131   *(fidelicet my selfe) and the three party is (lastly, and fi-nally)
132    mine Host of the Garter.
133   *<S {Ma.Pa}.> We three to hear it, & end it between them.
134   *<S {Euan}.> Ferry goo't, I will make a priefe of it in my
135   *note- booke, and we wil afterwards orke vpon the cause,
136    with as great discreetly as we can.
137    <S {Fal}.> {Pistoll}.
138    <S {Pist}.> He heares with eares.
139   *<S {Euan}.> The Teuill and his Tam: what phrase is this?
140    he heares with eare? why, it is affectations.
141    <S {Fal}.> {Pistoll}, did you picke M[aster]. {Slenders} purse?
142   *<S {Slen}.> #I, by these gloues did hee, or I would I might
143   *neuer come in mine owne great chamber againe else, of
144   *seauen groates in mill- sixpences, and two {Edward} Sho-uelboords,
145   *that cost me two shilling and two pence a
146    peece of {Yead Miller}: by these gloues.
147    <S {Fal}.> Is this true, {Pistoll}?
148    <S {Euan}.> No, it is false, if it is a picke- purse.
149   *<S {Pist}.> Ha, thou mountaine Forreyner: Sir {Iohn}, and
150   *Master mine, I combat challenge of this Latine Bilboe:
151   *word of deniall in thy {labras} here; word of denial; froth,
152    and scum thou liest.
153    <S {Slen}.> By these gloues, then 'twas he.
154   *<S {Nym}.> Be auis'd sir, and passe good humours: I will
155   *say marry trap with you, if you runne the nut- hooks hu-mor
156    on me, that is the very note of it.
157   *<S {Slen}.> By this hat, then he in the red face had it: for
158   *though I cannot remember what I did when you made
159    me drunke, yet I am not altogether an asse.
160    <S {Fal}.> What say you {Scarlet}, and {Iohn}?
161   *<S {Bar}.> Why sir, (for my part) I say the Gentleman had
162    drunke himselfe out of his fiue sentences.
163    <S {Eu}.> It is his fiue sences: fie, what the ignorance is.
164   *<S {Bar}.> And being fap, sir, was (as they say) casheerd: and
165    so conclusions past the Car-eires.
166   *<S {Slen}.> #I, you spake in Latten then #to: but 'tis no mat-ter;
167   *Ile nere be drunk whilst I liue againe, but in honest,
168   *ciuill, godly company for this tricke: if I be drunke, Ile
169   *be drunke with those that haue the feare of God, and not
170    with drunken knaues.
171    <S {Euan}.> So got- udge me, that is a vertuous minde.
172   *<S {Fal}.> You heare all these matters deni'd, Gentlemen;
173    you heare it.
174   *<S {Mr.Page}.>  Nay daughter, carry the wine in, wee'll
175    drinke within.
176    <S {Slen}.> Oh heauen: This is Mistresse {Anne Page}.
177    <S {Mr.Page}.>  How now Mistris {Ford}?
178   *<S {Fal}.> {Mistris Ford}, by my troth you are very wel met:
179    by your leaue good Mistris.
180   *<S {Mr.Page}.>  Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome: come,
181   *we haue a hot Venison pasty to dinner; Come gentle-men,
182    I hope we shall drinke downe all vnkindnesse.
183   *<S {Slen}.> I had rather then forty shillings I had my booke
184   *of Songs and Sonnets heere: How now {Simple}, where
185   *haue you beene? I must wait on my selfe, must I? you
186    haue not the booke of Riddles about you, haue you?
187   *<S {Sim}.> Booke of Riddles? why did you not lend it to
188   *{Alice Short- cake} vpon Alhallowmas last, a fortnight a-fore
189    Michaelmas.
190   *<S {Shal}.> Come Coz, come Coz, we stay for you: a word
191   *with you Coz: marry this, Coz: there is as 'twere a ten-der,
192   *a kinde of tender, made #a farre- off by Sir {Hugh} here:
193    doe you vnderstand me?
194   *<S {Slen}.> #I Sir, you shall finde me reasonable; if it be so,
195    I shall doe that that is reason.
196    <S {Shal}.> Nay, but vnderstand me.
197    <S {Slen}.> So I doe Sir.
198   *<S {Euan}.> Giue eare to his motions; (Mr. {Slender}) I will
199    description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
200   *<S {Slen}.> Nay, I will doe as my Cozen {Shallow} saies: I
201   *pray you pardon me, he's a Iustice of Peace in his Coun-trie,
202    simple though I stand here.
203   *<S {Euan}.> But that is not the question: the question is
204    concerning your marriage.
205    <S {Shal}.> #I, there's the point Sir.
206   *<S {Eu}.> Marry is it: the very point of it, to Mi[stris]. {#An Page}.
207   *<S {Slen}.> Why if it be so; I will marry her vpon any rea-sonable
208    demands.
209   *<S {Eu}.> But can you affection the 'o-man, let vs command
210   *to know that of your mouth, or of your lips: for diuers
211   *Philosophers hold, that the lips is parcell of the mouth:
212   *therfore precisely, ca[n] you carry your good #wil to y maid?
213    <S {Sh}.> Cosen {Abraham Slender}, can you loue her?
214   *<S {Slen}.> I hope sir, I will do as it shall become one that
215    would doe reason.
216   *<S {Eu}.> Nay, got's Lords, and his Ladies, you must speake
217   *possitable, if you can carry- her your desires towards her.
218    <S {Shal}.> That you must:
219    Will you, (vpon good dowry) marry her?
220   *<S {Slen}.> I will doe a greater thing then that, vpon your
221    request (Cosen) in any reason.
222   *<S {Shal}.> Nay conceiue me, conceiue mee, (sweet Coz):
223   *What I doe is to pleasure you (Coz:) can you loue the
224    maid?
225   *<S {Slen}.> I will marry her (Sir) at your request; but if
226   *there bee no great loue in the beginning, yet Heauen
227   *may decrease it vpon better acquaintance, when wee
228   *are married, and haue more occasion to know one ano-ther:
229   *I hope vpon familiarity will grow more content:
230   *but if you say mary- her, I will mary- her, that I am freely
231    dissolued, and dissolutely.
      <P D3><C D>
232   *<S {Eu}.> It is a fery discretion- answere; saue the fall is in
233   *the 'ord, dissolutely: the ort is (according to our mea-ning)
234    resolutely: his meaning is good.
235    <S {Sh}.> #I: I thinke my Cosen meant well.
236    <S {Sl}.> #I, or else I would I might be hang'd (la.)
237   *<S {Sh}.> Here comes faire Mistris {Anne}; would I were
238    yong for your sake, Mistris {Anne}.
239   *<S {An}.> The dinner is on the Table, my Father desires
240    your worships company.
241    <S {Sh}.> I will wait on him, (faire Mistris {Anne}.)
242   *<S {Eu}.> Od's plessed- wil: I wil not be abse[n]ce at the grace.
243    <S {An}.> #Wil't please your worship to come in, Sir?
244   *<S {Sl}.> No, I thank you forsooth, hartely; I am very well.
245    <S {An}.> The dinner attends you, Sir.
246   *<S {Sl}.> I am not a- hungry, I thanke you, forsooth: goe,
247   *Sirha, for all you are my man, goe wait vpon my Cosen
248   *{#Shallow}: a Iustice of peace sometime may be beholding
249   *to his friend, for a Man; I keepe but three Men, and a
250   *Boy yet, till my Mother be dead: but what though, yet
251    I liue like a poore Gentleman borne.
252   *<S {An}.> I may not goe in without your worship: they
253    will not sit till you come.
254   *<S {Sl}.> I' faith, ile eate nothing: I thanke you as much as
255    though I did.
256    <S {An}.> I pray you Sir walke in.
257   *<S {Sl}.> I had rather walke here (I thanke you) I bruiz'd
258   *my shin th' other day, with playing at Sword and Dag-ger
259   *with a Master of Fence (three veneys for a dish of
260   *stew'd Prunes) and by my troth, I cannot abide the smell
261   *of hot meate since. Why doe your dogs barke so? be
262    there Beares ith' Towne?
263    <S {An}.> I thinke there are, Sir, I heard them talk'd of.
264   *<S {Sl}.> I loue the sport well, but I shall as soone quarrell
265   *at it, as any man in {England}: you are afraid if you see the
266    Beare loose, are you not?
267    <S {An}.> #I indeede Sir.
268   *<S {Sl}.> That's meate and drinke to me now: I haue seene
269   *{Saskerson} loose, twenty times, and haue taken him by the
270   *Chaine: but (I warrant you) the women haue so cride
271   *and shrekt at it, that it past: But women indeede, cannot
272    abide 'em,  they are very ill- fauour'd rough things.
273   *<S {Ma.Pa}.>  Come, gentle M[aster]. {Slender}, come; we stay for you.
274    <S {Sl}.> Ile eate nothing, I thanke you Sir.
275   *<S {Ma.Pa}.> By cocke and pie, you shall not choose, Sir:

277    <S {Sl}.> Nay, pray you lead the way.
278    <S {Ma.Pa}.> Come on, Sir.
279    <S {Sl}.> Mistris {Anne}: your selfe shall goe first.
280    <S {An}.> Not I Sir, pray you keepe on.
281   *<S {Sl}.> Truely I will not goe first: truely- la: I will not
282    doe you that wrong.
283    <S {An}.> I pray you Sir.
284   *<S {Sl}.> Ile rather be vnmannerly, then troublesome: you
285    doe your selfe wrong indeede- la.  <D {Exeunt}.>
286    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
287    <D {Enter Euans, and Simple}.>

324    <S {Ni}.> The good humor is to steale at a minutes rest.
325   *<S {Pist}.> Conuay: the wise it call: Steale? foh: a fico for

331    <S {Fal}.> Which of you know {Ford} of this Towne?
332    <S {Pist}.> I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
333   *<S {Fal}.> My honest Lads, I will tell you what I am about.
334    <S {Pist}.> Two yards, and more.
335   *<S {Fal}.> No quips now {Pistoll}: (Indeede I am in the waste
336   *two yards about: but I am now about no waste: I am a-bout
337   *thrift) briefely: I doe meane to make loue to {Fords}
338   *wife: I spie entertainment in her: shee discourses: shee
339   *carues: she giues the leere of inuitation: I can construe
340   *the action of her familier stile, & the hardest voice of her
341   *behauior (to be english'd rightly) is, {I am Sir Iohn Falstafs}.
342   *<S {Pist}.> He hath studied her #will; and translated her #will:
343    out of honesty, into English.
344    <S {Ni}.> The Anchor is deepe: will that humor passe?
345   *<S {Fal}.> Now, the report goes, she has all the rule of her
346    husbands Purse: he hath a legend of Angels.
347   *<S {Pist}.> As many diuels entertaine: and to her Boy say I.
348   *<S {Ni}.> The humor rises: it is good: humor me the angels.
349   *<S {Fal}.> I haue writ me here a letter to her: & here ano-ther
350   *to {Pages} wife, who euen now gaue mee good eyes
351   *too; examind my parts with most iudicious illiads: some-times
352   *the beame of her view, guilded my foote: some-times
353    my portly belly.
      <P D3v>
354    <S {Pist}.> Then did the Sun on dung- hill shine.
355    <S {Ni}.> I thanke thee for that humour.
356   *<S {Fal}.> O she did so course o're my exteriors with such
357   *a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye, did seeme
358   *to scorch me vp like a burning- glasse: here's another
359   *letter to her: She beares the Purse too: She is a Region
360   *in {Guiana}: all gold, and bountie: I will be Cheaters to
361   *them both, and they shall be Exchequers to mee: they
362   *shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to
363   *them both: Goe, beare thou this Letter to Mistris {Page};
364   *and thou this to Mistris {Ford}: we will thriue (Lads) we
365    will thriue.
366    <S {Pist}.> Shall I Sir {Pandarus} of {Troy} become,
367    And by my side weare Steele? then Lucifer take all.
368   *<S {Ni}.> I will run no base humor: here take the humor- Letter;
369    I will keepe the hauior of reputation.
370    <S {Fal}.> Hold Sirha, beare you these Letters tightly,
371    Saile like my Pinnasse to these golden shores.
372    Rogues, hence, auaunt, vanish like haile- stones; goe,
373    Trudge; plod away ith' hoofe: seeke shelter, packe:
374    {Falstaffe} will learne the honor of the age,
375    French- thrift, you Rogues, my selfe, and skirted {Page}.
376   *<S {Pist}.> Let Vultures gripe thy guts: for gourd, and
377   *Fullam holds: & high and low beguiles the rich & poore,
378    Tester ile haue in pouch when thou shalt lacke,
379    Base {Phrygian} Turke.
380    <S {Ni}.> I haue opperations,
381    Which be humors of reuenge.
382    <S {Pist}.> Wilt thou reuenge?
383    <S {Ni}.> By Welkin, and her Star.
384    <S {Pist}.> With wit, or Steele?
385    <S {Ni}.> With both the humors, I:
386    I will discusse the humour of this Loue to {Ford}.
387    <S {Pist}.> And I to {Page} shall eke vnfold
388    How {Falstaffe} (varlet vile)
389    His Doue will proue; his gold will hold,
390    And his soft couch defile.
391   *<S {Ni}.> My humour shall not coole: I will incense {Ford}
392   *to deale with poyson: I will possesse him with yallow-nesse,
393   *for the reuolt of mine is dangerous: that is my
394    true humour.
395   *<S {Pist}.> Thou art the {Mars} of {Malecontents}: I second
396    thee: troope on.  <D {Exeunt}.>
397    <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
398    <D {Enter Mistris Quickly, Simple, Iohn Rugby, Doctor},
399    {Caius, Fenton}.>
400   *<S {Qu}.> What, {Iohn Rugby}, I pray thee goe to the Case-ment,
401   *and see if you can see my Master, Master Docter
402   *{#Caius} comming: if he doe (I' faith) and finde any body
403   *in the house; here will be an old abusing of Gods pati-ence,
404    and the Kings English.
405    <S {Ru}.> Ile goe watch.
406   *<S {Qu}.> Goe, and #we'll haue a posset for't soone at night,
407   *(in faith) at the latter end of a Sea- cole- fire: An honest,
408   *willing, kinde fellow, as euer seruant shall come in house
409   *withall: and I warrant you, no tel- tale, nor no breede-bate:
410   *his worst fault is, that he is giuen to prayer; hee is
411   *something peeuish that way: but no body but has his
412   *fault: but let that passe. {Peter Simple}, you say your
413    name is?
414    <S {Si}.> #I: for fault of a better.
415    <S {Qu}.> And Master {Slender}'s your Master?
416    <S {Si}.> #I forsooth.
417   *<S {Qu}.> Do's he not weare a great round Beard, like a
418    Glouers pairing- knife?
419   *<S {Si}.> No forsooth: he hath but a little wee- face; with
420    a little yellow Beard: a Caine colourd Beard.
421    <S {Qu}.> A softly- sprighted man, is he not?
422   *<S {Si}.> #I forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands, as
423   *any is betweene this and his head: he hath fought with
424    a Warrener.
425   *<S {Qu}.> How say you: oh, I should remember him: do's
426   *he not hold vp his head (as it were?) and strut in his gate?
427    <S {Si}.> Yes indeede do's he.
428   *<S {Qu}.> Well, heauen send {Anne Page}, no worse fortune:
429   *Tell Master Parson {Euans}, I will doe what I can for your
430    Master: {Anne} is a good girle, and I wish ===
431    <S {Ru}.> Out alas: here comes my Master.
432   *<S {Qu}.> We shall all be shent: Run in here, good young
433   *man: goe into this Closset: he will not stay long: what
434   *{Iohn Rugby}? {Iohn}: what {Iohn} I say? goe {Iohn}, goe en-quire
435   *for my Master, I doubt he be not well, that hee
436    comes not home: ({and downe, downe, adowne'a. &c}.
437   *<S {Ca}.> Vat is you sing? I doe not like des- toyes: pray
438   *you goe and vetch me in my Closset, vnboyteere verd;
439   *a Box, a greene- a- Box: do intend vat I speake? a greene- a- Box.
440   _
441    <S {Qu}.> #I forsooth ile fetch it you:
442   *I am glad hee went not in himselfe: if he had found the
443    yong man he would haue bin horne- mad.
444   *<S {Ca}.> {Fe, fe, fe, fe, mai foy, il fait #for ehando, Ie man voi a le}
445    {Court la grand affaires}.
446    <S {Qu}.> Is it this Sir?
447    <S {Ca}.> {Ouy mette le au mon pocket, de-peech quickly:}
448    Vere is dat knaue {Rugby}?
449    <S {Qu}.> What {Iohn Rugby}, {Iohn}?
450    <S {Ru}.> Here Sir.
451   *<S {Ca}.> You are {Iohn Rugby}, and you are  {Iacke Rugby}:
452   *Come, take- a- your Rapier, and come after my heele to
453    the Court.
454    <S {Ru}.> 'Tis ready Sir, here in the Porch.
455   *<S {Ca}.> By my trot: I tarry too long: od's- me: {que ay ie}
456   *{oublie}: dere is some Simples in my Closset, dat I vill not
457    for the varld I shall leaue behinde.
458   *<S {Qu}.> Ay- me, he'll finde the yong man there, & be mad.
459    <S {Ca}.> O {Diable}, {Diable}: vat is in my Closset?
460    Villanie, La-roone: {Rugby}, my Rapier.
461    <S {Qu}.> Good Master be content.
462    <S {Ca}.> Wherefore shall I be content- a?
463    <S {Qu}.> The yong man is an honest man.
464   *<S {Ca}.> What shall de honest man do in my Closset: dere
465    is no honest man dat shall come in my Closset.
466   *<S {Qu}.> I beseech you be not so flegmaticke: heare the
467   *truth of it. He came of an errand to mee, from Parson
468    {Hugh}.
469    <S {Ca}.> Vell.
470    <S {Si}.> #I forsooth: to desire her to ===
471    <S {Qu}.> Peace, I pray you.
472    <S {Ca}.> Peace- a- your tongue: speake- a- your Tale.
473   *<S {Si}.> To desire this honest Gentlewoman (your Maid)
474   *to speake a good word to Mistris {Anne Page}, for my Ma-ster
475    in the way of Marriage.
476   *<S {Qu}.> This is all indeede- la: but ile nere put my finger
477    in the fire, and neede not.
478   *<S {Ca}.> Sir {Hugh} send- a you? {Rugby}, ballow mee some
479    paper: tarry you a littell- a- while.
      <P D4><C C>
480    <S {Qui}.> I am glad he is so quiet: if he had bin through-ly
481   *moued, you should haue heard him so loud, and so me-lancholly:
482   *but notwithstanding man, Ile doe yoe your
483   *Master what good I can: and the very yea, & the #no is, y
484   *French Doctor my Master, (I may call him my Master,
485   *looke you, for I keepe his house; and I wash, ring, brew,
486   *bake, scowre, dresse meat and drinke, make the beds, and
487    doe all my selfe.)
488   *<S {Simp}.> 'Tis a great charge to come vnder one bodies
489    hand.
490   *<S {Qui}.> Are you a-uis'd o'that? you shall finde it a great
491   *charge: and to be vp early, and down late: but notwith-standing,
492   *(to tell you in your eare, I wold haue no words
493   *of it) my Master himselfe is in loue with Mistris {Anne}
494   *{#Page}: but notwithstanding that I know {Ans} mind, that's
495    neither heere nor there.
496   *<S {Caius}.> You, Iack'Nape: giue- 'a this Letter to Sir
497   *{Hugh}, by gar it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in de
498   *Parke, and I will teach a scuruy Iack-a-nape Priest to
499   *meddle, or make:===  you may be gon: it is not good
500   *you tarry here: by gar I will cut all his two stones: by
501    gar, he shall not haue a stone to throw at his dogge.
502    <S {Qui}.> Alas: he speakes but for his friend.
503   *<S {Caius}.> It is no matter  'a ver dat: do not you tell- a- me
504   *dat I shall haue {Anne Page} for my selfe? by gar, I vill
505   *kill de  Iack- Priest: and I haue appointed mine Host of
506   *de Iarteer to measure our weapon: by gar, I wil my selfe
507    haue {Anne Page}.
508   *<S {Qui}.> Sir, the maid loues you, and all shall bee well:
509   *We must giue folkes leaue to prate: what the good-ier.
510   *<S {Caius}.> {Rugby}, come to the Court with me: by gar, if
511   *I haue not {Anne Page}, I shall turne your head out of my
512    dore: follow my heeles, {Rugby}.
513   *<S {Qui}.> You shall haue {An}- fooles head of your owne:
514   *No, I know {Ans} mind for that: neuer a woman in {Wind-sor}
515   *knowes more of {Ans} minde then I doe, nor can doe
516    more then I doe with her, I thanke heauen.
517    <S {Fenton}.> Who's with in there, hoa?
518   *<S {Qui}.> Who's there, I troa? Come neere the house I
519    pray you.
520    <S {Fen}.> How now (good woman) how dost thou?
521   *<S {Qui}.> The better that it pleases your good Worship
522    to aske?
523    <S {Fen}.> What newes? how do's pretty Mistris {Anne}?
524   *<S {Qui}.> In truth Sir, and shee is pretty, and honest, and
525   *gentle, and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by
526    the way, I praise heauen for it.
527   *<S {Fen}.> Shall I doe any good thinkst thou? shall I not
528    loose my suit?
529   *<S {Qui}.> Troth Sir, all is in his hands aboue: but not-withstanding
530   *(Master {Fenton}) Ile be sworne on a booke
531   *shee loues you: haue not your Worship a wart aboue
532    your eye?
533    <S {Fen}.> Yes marry haue I, what of that?
534   *<S {Qui}.> Wel, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
535   *another {Nan}; (but (I detest) an honest maid as euer
536   *broke bread: wee had an howres talke of that wart; I
537   *shall neuer laugh but in that maids company: but (in-deed)
538   *shee is giuen too much to Allicholy and musing:
539    but for you === well === goe #too ===
540   *<S {Fen}.> Well: I shall see her to day: hold, there's mo-ney
541   *for thee: Let mee haue thy voice in my behalfe: if
542    thou seest her before me, commend me. ===
543   *<S {Qui}.> Will I? #I faith that wee will: And I will tell
544   *your Worship more of the Wart, the next time we haue
545    confidence, and of other wooers.
546    <S {Fen}.> Well, fare- well, I am in great haste now.
547   *<S {Qui}.> Fare- well to your Worship: truely an honest
548   *Gentleman: but {Anne} loues him not: for I know {Ans}
549   *minde as well as another do's: out vpon't: what haue I
550    forgot.  <D {Exit}.>

552   *<D {Enter Mistris} Page, {Mistris} Ford, {Master} Page, {Master}
553    Ford, Pistoll, Nim, Quickly, Host, Shallow.>
554   *<S {Mist.Page}.> What, haue scap'd Loue- letters in the
555   *holly- day- time of my beauty, and am I now a subiect
556    for them? let me see?
557   *{Aske me no reason why I loue you, for though Loue vse Rea-son}
558   *{for his precisian, hee admits him not for his Counsailour:}
559   *{you are not yong, no more am I: goe to then, there's simpathie:}
560   *{you are merry, so am I: ha, ha, then there's more simpathie:}
561   *{you loue sacke, and so do I: would you desire better simpathie?}
562   *{Let it suffice thee (Mistris Page) at the least if the Loue of}
563   *{Souldier can suffice, that I loue thee: I will not say pitty mee},
564    {'tis not a Souldier- like phrase; but I say, loue me:}
565    {By me, thine owne true Knight, by day or night:}
566    {Or any kinde of light, with all his #might},
567    {For thee to fight}.  {Iohn Falstaffe}.
568   *What a {Herod} of {Iurie} is this? O wicked, wicked world:
569    One that is well- nye worne to peeces with age
570    To show himselfe a yong Gallant? What an vnwaied
571    Behauiour hath this Flemish drunkard pickt (with
572   *The Deuills name) out of my conuersation, that he dares
573   *In this manner assay me? why, hee hath not beene thrice
574   *In my Company: what should I say to him? I was then
575   *Frugall of my mirth: (heauen forgiue mee:) why Ile
576   *Exhibit a Bill in the Parliament for the putting downe
577   *of men: how shall I be reueng'd on him? for reueng'd I
578    will be? as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
579   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> {Mistris Page}, trust me, I was going to your
580    house.
581   *<S {Mis.Page}.> And trust me, I was comming to you: you
582    looke very #ill.
583   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> Nay Ile nere beleeue that; I haue to shew
584    to the contrary.
585    <S {Mis.Page}.> 'Faith but you doe in my minde.
586   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> Well: I doe then: yet I say, I could shew
587   *you to the contrary: O Mistris {Page}, giue mee some
588    counsaile.
589    <S {Mis.Page}.> What's the matter, woman?
590   *<S {Mi.Ford}.>   O woman: if it were not for one trifling re-spect,
591    I could come to such honour.
592   *<S {Mi.Page}.> Hang the trifle (woman) take the honour:
593    what is it? dispence with trifles: what is it?
594   *<S {Mi.Ford}.> If I would but goe to #hell, for an eternall
595    moment, or so: I could be knighted.
596   *<S {Mi.Page}.> What thou liest? Sir {Alice Ford}? these
597   *Knights will hacke, and so thou shouldst not alter the ar-ticle
598    of thy Gentry.
599   *<S {Mi.Ford}.> Wee burne day- light: heere, read, read:
600   *perceiue how I might bee knighted, I shall thinke the
601   *worse of fat men, as long as I haue an eye to make diffe-rence
602   *of mens liking: and yet hee would not sweare:
      <P D4v>
603   *praise womens modesty: and gaue such orderly and wel-behaued
604   *reproofe to al vncomelinesse, that I would haue
605   *sworne his disposition would haue gone to the truth of
606   *his words: but they doe no more adhere and keep place
607   *together, then the hundred Psalms to the tune of Green-sleeues:
608   *What tempest (I troa) threw this Whale, (with
609   *so many Tuns of oyle in his belly) a'shoare at Windsor?
610   *How shall I bee reuenged on him? I thinke the best way
611   *were, to entertaine him with hope, till the wicked fire
612   *of lust haue melted him in his owne greace: Did you e-uer
613    heare the like?
614   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Letter for letter; but that the name of
615   *{#Page} and {Ford} differs: to thy great comfort in this my-stery
616   *of #ill opinions, heere's the twyn- brother of thy Let-ter:
617   *but let thine inherit first, for I protest mine neuer
618   *shall: I warrant he hath a thousand of these Letters, writ
619   *with blancke- space for different names (sure more): and
620   *these are of the second edition: hee will print them out
621   *of doubt: for he cares not what hee puts into the presse,
622   *when he would put vs two: I had rather be a Giantesse,
623   *and lye vnder Mount {Pelion}: Well; I will find you twen-tie
624    lasciuious Turtles ere one  chaste man.
625   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> Why this is the very same: the very hand:
626    the very words: what doth he thinke of vs?
627   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Nay I know not: it makes me almost rea-die
628   *to wrangle with mine owne honesty: Ile entertaine
629   *my selfe like one that I am not acquainted withall: for
630   *sure vnlesse hee know some straine in mee, that I know
631   *not my selfe, hee would neuer haue boorded me in this
632    furie.
633   *<S {Mi.Ford}.> Boording, call you it? Ile bee sure to keepe
634    him aboue decke.
635   *<S {Mi.Page}.> So will I: if hee come vnder my hatches,
636   *Ile neuer to Sea againe: Let's bee reueng'd on him: let's
637   *appoint him a meeting: giue him a show of comfort in
638   *his Suit, and lead him on with a fine baited delay, till hee
639    hath pawn'd his horses to mine Host of the Garter.
640   *<S {Mi.Ford}.> Nay, I wil consent to act any villany against
641   *him, that may not sully the charinesse of our honesty: oh
642   *that my husband saw this Letter: it would giue eternall
643    food to his iealousie.
644   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Why look where he comes; and my good
645   *man too: hee's as farre from iealousie, as I am from gi-uing
646   *him cause, and that (I hope) is an vnmeasurable di-stance.
647   _
648    <S {Mis.Ford}.> You are the happier woman.
649   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Let's consult together against this greasie
650    Knight: Come hither.
651    <S {Ford}.> Well: I hope, it be not so.
652    <S {Pist}.> Hope is a curtall- dog in some affaires:
653    Sir {Iohn} affects thy wife.
654    <S {Ford}.> Why sir, my wife is not young.
655   *<S {Pist}.> He wooes both high and low, both rich & poor,
656   *both yong and old, one with another ({Ford}) he loues the
657    Gally- mawfry ({Ford}) perpend.
658    <S {Ford}.> Loue my wife?
659    <S {Pist}.> With liuer, burning hot: preuent:
660    Or goe thou like Sir {Acteon} he, with
661    Ring- wood at thy heeles: O, odious is the name.
662    <S {Ford}.> What name Sir?
663    <S {Pist}.> The horne I say: Farewell:
664   *Take heed, haue open eye, for theeues doe foot by night.
665   *Take heed, ere sommer comes, or Cuckoo- birds do sing.
666    Away sir Corporall {Nim}:
667    Beleeue it ({Page}) he speakes sence.
668    <S {Ford}.> I will be patient: I will find out this.
669   *<S {Nim}.> And this is true: I like not the humor of lying:
670   *hee hath wronged mee in some humors: I should haue
671   *borne the humour'd Letter to her: but I haue a sword:
672   *and it shall bite vpon my necessitie: he loues your wife;
673   *There's the short and the long: My name is Corporall
674   *{#Nim}: I speak, and I auouch; 'tis true: my name is {Nim}:
675   *and {Falstaffe} loues your wife: adieu, I loue not the hu-mour
676    of bread and cheese: adieu.
677   *<S {Page}.> The humour of it (quoth 'a?) heere's a fellow
678    frights English out of his wits.
679    <S {Ford}.> I will seeke out {Falstaffe}.
680   *<S {Page}.> I neuer heard such a drawling- affecting rogue.
681    <S {Ford}.> If I doe finde it: well.
682   *<S {Page}.> I will not beleeue such a {Cataian}, though the
683    Priest o' th' Towne   commended him for a true man.
684    <S {Ford}.> 'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
685    <S {Page}.> How now {Meg}?
686    <S {Mist.Page}.> Whether goe you ({George}?) harke you.
687   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> How now (sweet {Frank}) why art thou me-lancholy?
688   _
689    <S {Ford}.> I melancholy? I am not melancholy:
690    Get you home: goe.
691   *<S {Mis.Ford}.> Faith, thou hast some crochets in thy head,
692    Now: will you goe, {Mistris Page}?
693   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Haue with you: you'll come to dinner
694   *{George}? Looke who comes yonder: shee shall bee our
695    Messenger to this paltrie Knight.
696    <S {Mis.Ford}.> Trust me, I thought on her: shee'll fit it.
697   *<S {Mis.Page}.> You are come to see my daughter {Anne}?
698   *<S {Qui}.> #I forsooth: and I pray how do's good Mistresse
699    {Anne}?
700   *<S {Mis.Page}.> Go in with vs and see: we haue an houres
701    talke with you.
702    <S {Page}.> How now Master Ford?
703   *<S {For}.> You heard what this knaue told me, did you not?
704    <S {Page}.> Yes, and you heard what the other told me?
705    <S {Ford}.> Doe you thinke there is truth in them?
706   *<S {Pag}.> Hang 'em slaues: I doe not thinke the Knight
707   *would offer it: But these that accuse him in his intent
708   *towards our wiues, are a yoake of his discarded men: ve-ry
709    rogues, now they be out of seruice.
710    <S {Ford}.> Were they his men?
711    <S {Page}.> Marry were they.
712    <S {Ford}.> I like it neuer the beter for that,
713    Do's he lye at the Garter?
714   *<S {Page}.> #I marry do's he: if hee should intend this voy-age
715   *toward my wife, I would turne her loose to him;
716   *and what hee gets more of her, then sharpe words, let it
717    lye on my head.
718   *<S {Ford}.> I doe not misdoubt my wife: but I would bee
719   *loath to turne them together: a man may be too confi-dent:
720   *I would haue nothing lye on my head: I cannot
721    be thus satisfied.
722   *<S {Page}.> Looke where my ranting- Host of the Garter
723   *comes: there is eyther liquor in his pate, or mony in his
724   *purse, when hee lookes so merrily: How now mine
725    Host?
726   *<S {Host}.> How now Bully- Rooke: thou'rt a Gentleman
727    Caueleiro Iustice, I say.
728   *<S {Shal}.> I follow, (mine Host) I follow: Good- euen,
729   *and twenty (good Master {Page}.) Master {Page}, wil you go
730    with vs? we haue sport in hand.
731   *<S {Host}.> Tell him Caueleiro- Iustice: tell him Bully- Rooke.
732   _
733   *<S {Shall}.> Sir, there is a fray to be fought, betweene Sir
734    {Hugh} the Welch Priest, and {Caius} the French Doctor.
      <P D5>
735   *<S {Ford}.> Good mine Host o'th' Garter:   a word with you.
736    <S {Host}.> What saist thou, my Bully- Rooke?
737   *<S {Shal}.> Will you goe with vs to behold it? My merry
738   *Host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and (I
739   *thinke) hath appointed them contrary places: for (be-leeue
740   *mee) I heare the Parson is no Iester: harke, I will
741    tell you what our sport shall be.
742   *<S {Host}.> Hast thou no suit against my Knight? my guest- Caualeire?
743   _
744   *<S {Shal}.> None, I protest: but Ile giue you a pottle of
745   *burn'd sacke, to giue me recourse to him, and tell him
746    my name is {Broome}: onely for a iest.
747   *<S {Host}.> My hand, (Bully:) thou shalt haue egresse and
748   *regresse, (said I well?) and thy name shall be {Broome}. It
749    is a merry Knight: will you goe An- heires?
750    <S {Shal}.> Haue with you mine Host.
751   *<S {Page}.> I haue heard the French- man hath good skill
752    in his Rapier.
753   *<S {Shal}.> Tut sir: I could haue told you more: In these
754   *times you stand on distance: your Passes, Stoccado's, and
755   *I know not what: 'tis the heart (Master {Page}) 'tis heere,
756   *'tis heere: I haue seene the time, with my long- sword, I
757   *would haue made you fowre tall fellowes skippe like
758    Rattes.
759    <S {Host}.> Heere boyes, heere, heere: shall we wag?
760   *<S {Page}.> Haue with you: I had rather heare them scold,
761    then fight.
762   *<S {Ford}.> Though {Page} be a secure foole, and stands so
763   *firmely on his wiues frailty; yet, I cannot put- off my o-pinion
764   *so easily: she was in his company at {Pages} house:
765   *and what they made there, I know not. Well, I wil looke
766   *further into't, and I haue a disguise, to sound {Falstaffe}; if
767   *I finde her honest, I loose not my labor: if she be other-wise,
768   *'tis labour well bestowed.  <D {Exeunt}.>
769    <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
770   *<D {Enter} Falstaffe, Pistoll, Robin, Quickly, Bardolffe,
771    Ford.>
772    <S {Fal}.> I will not lend thee a penny.
773   *<S {Pist}.> Why then the world's mine Oyster, which I,
774    with sword will open.
775   *<S {Fal}.> Not a penny: I haue beene content (Sir,) you
776   *should lay my countenance to pawne: I haue grated vp-on
777   *my good friends for three Repreeues for you, and
778   *your Coach- fellow {Nim}; or else you had look'd through
779   *the grate, like a Geminy of Baboones: I am damn'd in
780   *#hell, for swearing to Gentlemen my friends, you were
781   *good Souldiers, and tall- fellowes. And when Mistresse
782   *{Briget} lost the handle of her Fan, I took't vpon mine ho-nour
783    thou hadst it not.
784   *<S {Pist}.> Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteene
785    pence?
786   *<S {Fal}.> Reason, you roague, reason: thinkst thou Ile en-danger
787   *my soule, {gratis}? at a word, hang no more about
788   *mee, I am no gibbet for you: goe, a short knife, and a
789   *throng, to your Mannor of {Pickt- hatch}: goe, you'll not
790   *beare a Letter for mee you roague? you stand vpon your
791   *honor: why, (thou vnconfinable basenesse) it is as much
792   *as I can doe to keepe the termes of my honor precise:
793   *#I, #I, I my selfe sometimes, leauing the feare of heauen on
794   *the left hand, and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am
795   *faine to shufflle: to hedge, and to lurch, and yet, you
796   *Rogue, will en- sconce your raggs; your Cat- a- Moun-taine- lookes,
797   *your red- lattice phrases, and your bold-beating- oathes,
798   *vnder the shelter of your honor? you
799    will not doe it? you?
800    <S {Pist}.> I doe relent: what would thou more of man?
801    <S {Robin}.> Sir, here's a woman would speake with you.
802    <S {Fal}.> Let her approach.
803    <S {Qui}.> Giue your worship good morrow.
804    <S {Fal}.> Good- morrow, good- wife.
805    <S {Qui}.> Not so, and't please your worship.
806    <S {Fal}.> Good maid then.
807    <S {Qui}.> Ile be sworne,
808    As my mother was the first houre I was borne.
809    <S {Fal}.> I doe beleeue the swearer; what with me?
810   *<S {Qui}.> Shall I vouch- safe your worship a word, or
811    two?
812   *<S {Fal}.> Two thousand (faire woman) and ile vouchsafe
813    thee the hearing.
814   *<S {Qui}.> There is one Mistresse {Ford}, (Sir) I pray come a
815   *little neerer this waies: I my selfe dwell with M[aster]. Doctor
816    {Caius}:
817    <S {Fal}.> Well, on; Mistresse {Ford}, you say.
818   *<S {Qui}.> Your worship saies very true: I pray your wor-ship
819    come a little neerer this waies.
820   *<S {Fal}.> I warrant thee, no- bodie heares: mine owne
821    people, mine owne people.
822   *<S {Qui}.> Are they so? heauen- blesse them, and make
823    them his Seruants.
824    <S {Fal}.> Well; Mistresse {Ford}, what of her?
825   *<S {Qui}.> Why, Sir; shee's a good- creature; Lord, Lord,
826   *your Worship's a wanton: well: heauen forgiue you,
827    and all of vs, I pray ===.
828    <S {Fal}.> Mistresse {Ford}: come, Mistresse {Ford}.
829   *<S {Qui}.> Marry this is the short, and the long of it: you
830   *haue brought her into such a Canaries, as 'tis wonder-full:
831   *the best Courtier of them all (when the Court lay
832   *at {Windsor}) could neuer haue brought her to such a Ca-narie:
833   *yet there has beene Knights, and Lords, and Gen-tlemen,
834   *with their Coaches; I warrant you Coach after
835   *Coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweet-ly;
836   *all Muske, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silke
837   *and golde, and in such alligant termes, and in such wine
838   *and suger of the best, and the fairest, that would haue
839   *wonne any womans heart: and I warrant you, they could
840   *neuer get an eye- winke of her: I had my selfe twentie
841   *Angels giuen me this morning, but I defie all Angels (in
842   *any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty: and
843   *I warrant you, they could neuer get her so much as sippe
844   *on a cup with the prowdest of them all, and yet there has
845   *beene Earles: nay, (which is more) Pentioners, but I
846    warrant you all is one with her.
847   *<S {Fal}.> But what saies shee to mee? be briefe my good
848    shee-{#Mercurie}.
849   *<S {Qui}.> Marry, she hath receiu'd your Letter: for the
850   *which she thankes you a thousand times; and she giues
851   *you to notifie, that her husband will be absence from his
852    house, betweene ten and eleuen.
853    <S {Fal}.> Ten, and eleuen.
854   *<S {Qui}.> #I, forsooth: and then you may come and see the
855   *picture (she sayes) that you wot of: Master {Ford} her hus-band
856   *will be from home: alas, the sweet woman leades
857   *an #ill life with him: hee's a very iealousie- man; she leads
858    a very frampold life with him, (good hart.)
859    <S {Fal}.> Ten, and eleuen.
      <P D5v>
860    Woman, commend me to her, I will not faile her.
861   *<S {Qui}.> Why, you say well: But I haue another messen-ger
862   *to your worship: Mistresse {Page} hath her heartie
863   *commendations to you #to: and let mee tell you in your
864   *eare, shee's as fartuous a ciuill modest wife, and one (I
865   *tell you) that will not misse you morning nor euening
866   *prayer, as any is in {Windsor}, who ere bee the other: and
867   *shee bade me tell your worship, that her husband is sel-dome
868   *from home, but she hopes there will come a time.
869   *I neuer knew a woman so doate vpon a man; surely I
870    thinke you haue charmes, la: yes in truth.
871   *<S {Fal}.> Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my
872    good parts aside, I haue no other charmes.
873    <S {Qui}.> Blessing on your heart for't.
874   *<S {Fal}.> But I pray thee tell me this: has {Fords} wife, and
875    {Pages} wife acquainted each other, how they loue me?
876   *<S {Qui}.> That were a iest indeed: they haue not so little
877   *grace I hope, that were a tricke indeed: But Mistris {Page}
878   *would desire you to send her your little Page of al loues:
879   *her husband has a maruellous infectio[n] to the little Page:
880   *and truely Master {Page} is an honest man: neuer a wife in
881   *{Windsor} leades a better life then she do's: doe what shee
882   *will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goe to bed when
883   *she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and truly she
884   *deserues it; for if there be a kinde woman in {Windsor}, she
885    is one: you must send her your Page, no remedie.
886    <S {Fal}.> Why, I will.
887   *<S {Qu}.> Nay, but doe so then, and looke you, hee may
888   *come and goe betweene you both: and in any case haue
889   *a nay- word, that you may know one anothers minde,
890   *and the Boy neuer neede to vnderstand any thing; for
891   *'tis not good that children should know any wickednes:
892   *olde folkes you know, haue discretion, as they say, and
893    know the world.
894   *<S {Fal}.> Farethee- well, commend mee to them both:
895   *there's my purse, I am yet thy debter: Boy, goe along
896    with this woman, this newes distracts me.
897    <S {Pist}.> This Puncke is one of {Cupids} Carriers,
898    Clap on more sailes, pursue: vp with your sights:
899    Giue fire: she is my prize, or Ocean whelme them all.
900   *<S {Fal}.> Saist thou so (old {Iacke}) go thy waies: Ile make
901   *more of thy olde body then I haue done: will they yet
902   *looke after thee? wilt thou after the expence of so much
903   *money, be now a gainer? good Body, I thanke thee: let
904   *them say 'tis grossely done, so it bee fairely done, no
905    matter.
906   *<S {Bar}.> Sir {Iohn}, there's one Master {Broome} below would
907   *faine speake with you, and be acquainted with you; and
908    hath sent your worship a mornings draught of Sacke.
909    <S {Fal}.> {Broome} is his name?
910    <S {Bar}.> #I Sir.
911   *<S {Fal}.> Call him in: such {Broomes} are welcome to mee,
912   *that ore'flowes such liquor: ah ha, Mistresse {Ford} and Mi-stresse
913    {Page}, haue I encompass'd you? goe to, {via}.
914    <S {Ford}.> 'Blesse you sir.
915    <S {Fal}.> And you sir: would you speake with me?
916   *<S {Ford}.> I make bold, to presse, with so little prepara-tion
917    vpon you.
918   *<S {Fal}.> #You'r welcome, what's your #will? giue vs leaue
919    Drawer.
920   *<S {Ford}.> Sir, I am a Gentleman that haue spent much,
921    my name is {Broome}.
922   *<S {Fal}.> Good Master {Broome}, I desire more acquaintance
923    of you.
924   *<S {Ford}.> Good Sir {Iohn}, I sue for yours: not to charge
925   *you, for I must let you vnderstand, I thinke my selfe in
926   *better plight for a Lender, then you are: the which hath
927   *something emboldned me to this vnseason'd intrusion:
928   *for they say, if money goe before, all waies doe lye
929    open.
930    <S {Fal}.> Money is a good Souldier (Sir) and will on.
931   *<S {Ford}.> Troth, and I haue a bag of money heere trou-bles
932   *me: if you will helpe to beare it (Sir {Iohn}) take all,
933    or halfe, for easing me of the carriage.
934   *<S {Fal}.> Sir, I know not how I may deserue to bee your
935    Porter.
936   *<S {Ford}.> I will tell you sir, if you will giue mee the hea-ring.
937   _
938   *<S {Fal}.> Speake (good Master {Broome}) I shall be glad to
939    be your Seruant.
940   *<S {Ford}.> Sir, I heare you are a Scholler: (I will be briefe
941   *with you) and you haue been a man long knowne to me,
942   *though I had neuer so good means as desire, to make my
943   *selfe acquainted with you. I shall discouer a thing to
944   *you, wherein I must very much lay open mine owne im-perfection:
945   *but (good Sir {Iohn}) as you haue one eye vp-on
946   *my follies, as you heare them vnfolded, turne another
947   *into the Register of your owne, that I may passe with a
948   *reproofe the easier, sith you your selfe know how easie it
949    is to be such an offender.
950    <S {Fal}.> Very well Sir, proceed.
951   *<S {Ford}.> There is a Gentlewoman in this Towne, her
952    husbands name is {Ford}.
953    <S {Fal}.> Well Sir.
954   *<S {Ford}.> I haue long lou'd her, and I protest to you, be-stowed
955   *much on her: followed her with a doating ob-seruance:
956   *Ingross'd opportunities to meete her: fee'd e-uery
957   *slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee
958   *sight of her: not only bought many presents to giue her,
959   *but haue giuen largely to many, to know what shee
960   *would haue giuen: briefly, I haue pursu'd her, as Loue
961   *hath pursued mee, which hath beene on the wing of all
962   *occasions: but whatsoeuer I haue merited, either in my
963   *minde, or in my meanes, meede I am sure I haue receiued
964   *none, vnlesse Experience be a Iewell, that I haue purcha-sed
965   *at an infinite rate, and that hath taught mee to say
966    this,
967    "{Loue like a shadow flies, when substance Loue pursues},
968    "{Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues}.
969   *<S {Fal}.> Haue you receiu'd no promise of satisfaction at
970    her hands?
971    <S {Ford}.> Neuer.
972    <S {Fal}.> Haue you importun'd her to such a purpose?
973    <S {Ford}.> Neuer.
974    <S {Fal}.> Of what qualitie was your loue then?
975   *<S {Ford}.> Like a fair house, built on another mans ground,
976   *so that I haue lost my edifice, by mistaking the place,
977    where I erected it.
978    <S {Fal}.> To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me?
979   *<S {For}.> When I haue told you that, I haue told you all:
980   *Some say, that though she appeare honest to mee, yet in
981   *other places shee enlargeth her mirth so farre, that there
982   *is shrewd construction made of her. Now (Sir {Iohn}) here
983   *is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of ex-cellent
984   *breeding, admirable discourse, of great admit-tance,
985   *authenticke in your place and person, generally
986   *allow'd for your many war- like, court- like, and learned
987    preparations.
988    <S {Fal}.> O Sir.
989   *<S {Ford}.> Beleeue it, for you know it: there is money,
990   *spend it, spend it, spend more; spend all I haue, onely
      <P D6>
991   *giue me so much of your time in enchange of it, as to lay
992   *an amiable siege to the honesty of this {Fords} wife: vse
993   *your #Art of wooing; win her to consent to you: if any
994    man may, you may as soone as any.
995   *<S {Fal}.> Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
996   *affection that I should win what you would enioy? Me-thinkes
997    you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously.
998   *<S {Ford}.> O, vnderstand my drift: she dwells so securely
999   *on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soule
1000  *dares not present it selfe: shee is too bright to be look'd
1001  *against. Now, could I come to her with any detection
1002  *in my hand; my desires had instance and argument to
1003  *commend themselues, I could driue her then from the
1004  *ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage- vow,
1005  *and a thousand other her defences, which now are too-too
1006  *strongly embattaild against me: what say you too't,
1007   Sir {Iohn}?
1008  *<S {Fal}.> Master {Broome}, I will first make bold with your
1009  *money: next, giue mee your hand: and last, as I am a
1010   gentleman, you shall, if you will, enioy {Fords} wife.
1011   <S {Ford}.> O good Sir.
1012   <S {Fal}.> I say you shall.
1013  *<S {Ford}.> Want no money (Sir {Iohn}) you shall want none.
1014  *<S {Fal}.> Want no {Mistresse Ford} (Master {Broome}) you shall
1015  *want none: I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her
1016  *owne appointment, euen as you came in to me, her assi-stant,
1017  *or goe- betweene, parted from me: I say I shall be
1018  *with her betweene ten and eleuen: for at that time the
1019  *iealious- rascally- knaue her husband will be forth: come
1020   you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.
1021  *<S {Ford}.> I am blest in your acquaintance: do you know
1022   {Ford} Sir?
1023  *<S {Fal}.> Hang him (poore Cuckoldly knaue) I know
1024  *him not: yet I wrong him to call him poore: They say
1025  *the iealous wittolly- knaue hath masses of money, for
1026  *the which his wife seemes to me well- fauourd: I will vse
1027  *her as the key of the Cuckoldly- rogues Coffer, & ther's
1028   my haruest- home.
1029  *<S {Ford}.> I would you knew {Ford}, sir, that you might a-uoid
1030   him, if you saw him.
1031  *<S {Fal}.> Hang him, mechanicall- salt- butter rogue; I wil
1032  *stare him out of his wits: I will awe- him with my cud-gell:
1033  *it shall hang like a Meteor ore the Cuckolds horns:
1034  *Master {Broome}, thou shalt know, I will predominate o-uer
1035  *the pezant, and thou shalt lye with his wife. Come
1036  *to me soone at night: {Ford}'s a knaue, and I will aggra-uate
1037  *his stile: thou (Master {Broome}) shalt know him for
1038   knaue, and Cuckold. Come to me soone at night.
1039  *<S {Ford}.> What a damn'd Epicurian- Rascall is this? my
1040  *heart is ready to cracke with impatience: who saies this
1041  *is improuident iealousie? my wife hath sent to him, the
1042  *howre is fixt, the match is made: would any man haue
1043  *thought this? see the #hell of hauing a false woman: my
1044  *bed shall be abus'd, my Coffers ransack'd, my reputati-on
1045  *gnawne at,  and I shall not onely receiue this villanous
1046  *wrong, but stand vnder the adoption of abhominable
1047  *termes, and by him that does mee this wrong: Termes,
1048  *names: {Amaimon} sounds well: {Lucifer}, well: {Barbason},
1049  *well: yet they are Diuels additions, the names of fiends:
1050  *But Cuckold, Wittoll, Cuckold? the Diuell himselfe
1051  *hath not such a name. {Page} is an Asse, a secure Asse; hee
1052  *will trust his wife, hee will not be iealous: I will rather
1053  *trust a {Fleming} with my butter, Parson {Hugh} the {Welsh-man}
1054  *with my Cheese, an {Irish- man} with my Aqua- vitae- bottle,
1055  *or a Theefe to walke my ambling gelding, then
1056  *my wife with her selfe. Then she plots, then shee rumi-nates,
1057  *then shee deuises: and what they thinke in their
1058  *hearts they may effect; they will breake their hearts but
1059  *they will effect. Heauen bee prais'd for my iealousie:
1060  *eleuen #o' clocke the howre, I will preuent this, detect
1061  *my wife, bee reueng'd on {Falstaffe}, and laugh at {Page}. I
1062  *will about it, better three houres too soone, then a my-nute
1063  *too late: fie, fie, fie: Cuckold, Cuckold, Cuckold.

1354   <S {M.Page}.> Quickly, quickly: Is the Buck- basket ===
1355   <S {Mis.Ford}.> I warrant. What {Robin} I say.
1356   <S {Mis.Page}.> Come, come, come.
1357   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Heere, set it downe.
1358  *<S {M.Pag}.> Giue your men the charge, we must be briefe.
1359  *<S {M.Ford}.> Marrie, as I told you before ({Iohn} & {Robert})
1360  *be ready here hard- by in the Brew- house, & when I so-dainly
1361  *call you, come forth, and (without any pause, or
1362  *staggering) take this basket on your shoulders: y done,
1363  *trudge with it in all #hast, and carry it among the Whit-sters
1364  *in {Dotchet} Mead, and there empty it in the muddie
1365   ditch, close by the Thames side.
1366   <S {M.Page}.> You will do it?
1367  *<S {M.Ford}.> I #ha told them ouer and ouer, they lacke no |(direction.
      <P E1v>
1368   Be gone, and come when you are call'd.
1369   <S {M.Page}.> Here comes little {Robin}.
1370  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> How now my Eyas- Musket, what newes |(with you?
1371   <S {Rob}.> My M[aster]. Sir {Iohn} is come in at your backe doore
1372   (Mist[ris]. {Ford}, and requests your company.
1373  *<S {M.Page}.> You litle Iack- a- lent, haue you bin true to vs
1374  *<S {Rob}.> #I, Ile be sworne: my Master knowes not of your
1375  *being heere: and hath threatned to put me into euerla-sting
1376  *liberty, if I tell you of it: for he sweares he'll turne
1377   me away.
1378  *<S {Mist.Pag}.> Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine
1379  *shall be a Tailor to thee, and shal make thee a new dou-blet
1380   and hose. Ile go hide me.
1381  *<S {Mi.Ford}.> Do so: go tell thy Master, I am alone: Mi-stris
1382   {Page}, remember you your {Qu}.
1383   <S {Mist.Pag}.> I warrant thee, if I do not act it, hisse me.
1384  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Go- too then: #we'l vse this vnwholsome
1385  *humidity, this grosse- watry Pumpion; #we'll teach him
1386   to know Turtles from Iayes.
1387  *<S {Fal}.> Haue I caught thee, my heauenly Iewell? Why
1388  *now let me die, for I haue liu'd long enough: This is the
1389   period of my ambition: O this blessed houre.
1390   <S {Mist.Ford}.> O sweet Sir {Iohn}.
1391  *<S {Fal}.> Mistris {Ford}, I cannot cog, I cannot prate (Mist[ris].
1392  *{#Ford}) now shall I sin in my wish; I would thy Husband
1393  *were dead, Ile speake it before the best Lord, I would
1394   make thee my Lady.
1395  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> I your Lady Sir {Iohn}? Alas, I should bee a
1396   pittifull Lady.
1397  *<S {Fal}.> Let the Court of France shew me such another:
1398  *I see how thine eye would emulate the Diamond: Thou
1399  *hast the right arched- beauty of the brow, that becomes
1400  *the Ship- tyre, the Tyre- valiant, or any Tire of Venetian
1401   admittance.
1402   <S {Mist.Ford}.> A plaine Kerchiefe, Sir {Iohn}:
1403   My browes become nothing else, nor that well neither.
1404  *<S {Fal}.> Thou art a tyrant to say so: thou wouldst make
1405  *an absolute Courtier, and the firme fixture of thy foote,
1406  *would giue an excellent motion to thy gate, in a semi-circled
1407  *Farthingale. I see what thou wert if Fortune thy
1408  *foe, were not Nature thy friend: Come, thou canst not
1409   hide it.
1410   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Beleeue me, ther's no such thing in me.
1411  *<S {Fal}.> What made me loue thee? Let that perswade
1412  *thee. Ther's something extraordinary in thee: Come, I
1413  *cannot cog, and say thou art this and that, like a- manie
1414  *of these lisping- hauthorne buds, that come like women
1415  *in mens apparrell, and smell like Bucklers- berry in sim-ple
1416  *time: I cannot, but I loue thee, none but thee; and
1417   thou deseru'st it.
1418  *<S {M.Ford}.> Do not betray me sir, I fear you loue M[istris]. {Page}.
1419  *<S {Fal}.> Thou mightst as well say, I loue to walke by the
1420  *Counter- gate, which is as hatefull to me, as the reeke of
1421   a Lime- kill.
1422   <S {Mis.Ford}.> Well, heauen knowes how I loue you,
1423   And you shall one day finde it.
1424   <S {Fal}.> Keepe in that minde, Ile deserue it.
1425   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Nay, I must tell you, so you doe;
1426   Or else I could not be in that minde.
1427  *<S {Rob}.> Mistris {Ford}, Mistris {Ford}: heere's Mistris {Page} at
1428  *the doore, sweating, and blowing, and looking wildely,
1429   and would needs speake with you presently.
1430  *<S {Fal}.> She shall not see me, I will ensconce mee behinde
1431   the Arras.
1432  *<S {M.Ford}.> Pray you do so, she's a very tatling woman.
1433   Whats the matter? How now?
1434   <S {Mist.Page}.> O mistris {Ford} what haue you done?
1435  *#You'r sham'd, y'are ouerthrowne, y'are vndone for euer.
1436   <S {M.Ford}.> What's the matter, good mistris {Page}?
1437  *<S {M.Page}.> O weladay, mist[ris]. {Ford}, hauing an honest man
1438   to your husband, to giue him such cause of suspition.
1439   <S {M.Ford}.> What cause of suspition?
1440   <S {M.Page}.> What cause of suspition? Out vpon you:
1441   How am I mistooke in you?
1442   <S {M.Ford}.> Why (alas) what's the matter?
1443  *<S {M.Page}.> Your husband's comming hether (Woman)
1444  *with all the Officers in Windsor, to search for a Gentle-man,
1445  *that he sayes is heere now in the house; by your
1446  *consent to take an #ill aduantage of his absence: you are
1447   vndone.
1448   <S {M.Ford}.> 'Tis not so, I hope.
1449  *<S {M.Page}.> Pray heauen it be not so, that you haue such
1450  *a man heere: but 'tis most certaine your husband's com-ming,
1451  *with halfe Windsor at his heeles, to serch for such
1452  *a one, I come before to tell you: If you know your selfe
1453  *cleere, why I am glad of it: but if you haue a friend here,
1454  *conuey, conuey him out. Be not amaz'd, call all your
1455  *senses to you, defend your reputation, or bid farwell to
1456   your good life for euer.
1457  *<S {M.Ford}.> What shall I do? There is a Gentleman my
1458  *deere friend: and I feare not mine owne shame so much,
1459  *as his perill. I had rather then a thousand pound he were
1460   out of the house.
1461  *<S {M.Page}.> For shame, neuer stand (you had rather, and
1462  *you had rather:) your husband's heere at hand, bethinke
1463  *you of some conueyance: in the house you cannot hide
1464  *him. Oh, how haue you deceiu'd me? Looke, heere is a
1465  *basket, if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creepe
1466  *in heere, and throw fowle linnen vpon him, as if it were
1467  *going to bucking: Or it is whiting time, send him by
1468   your two men to {Datchet}- Meade.
1469   <S {M.Ford}.> He's too big to go in there: what shall I do?
1470   <S {Fal}.> Let me see't, let me see't, O let me see't:
1471   Ile in, Ile in: Follow your friends counsell, Ile in.
1472  *<S {M.Page}.> What Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}? Are these your Let-ters,
1473   Knight?
1474  *<S {Fal}.> I loue thee, helpe mee away: let me creepe in
1475   heere: ile neuer ===
1476  *<S {M.Page}.> Helpe to couer your master (Boy:) Call
1477   your men (Mist[ris]. {Ford}.) You dissembling Knight.
1478  *<S {M.Ford}.> What {Iohn}, {Robert}, {Iohn}; Go, take vp these
1479  *cloathes heere, quickly: Wher's the Cowle- staffe? Look
1480  *how you drumble? Carry them to the Landresse in Dat-chet
1481   mead: quickly, come.
1482  *<S {Ford}.> 'Pray you come nere: if I suspect without cause,
1483   Why then make sport at me, then let me be your iest,
1484   I deserue it: How now? Whether beare you this?
1485   <S {Ser}.> To the Landresse forsooth?
1486  *<S {M.Ford}.> Why, what haue you to doe whether they
1487   beare it? You were best meddle with buck- washing.
1488  *<S {Ford}.> Buck? I would I could wash my selfe of y Buck:
1489   Bucke, bucke, bucke, #I bucke: I warrant you Bucke,
1490   And of the season too; it shall appeare.
1491  *Gentlemen, I haue dream'd to night, Ile tell you my
1492  *dreame: heere, heere, heere bee my keyes, ascend my
1493  *Chambers, search, seeke, finde out: Ile warrant wee'le
1494  *vnkennell the Fox. Let me stop this way first: so, now
1495   vncape.
1496   <S {Page}.> Good master {Ford}, be contented:
1497   You wrong your selfe too much.
1498   <S {Ford}.> True (master {Page}) vp Gentlemen,
1499   You shall see sport anon:
      <P E2>
1500   Follow me Gentlemen.
1501  *<S {Euans}.> This is fery fantasticall humors and iealousies.
1502   <S {Caius}.> By gar, 'tis #no- the fashion of France:
1503   It is not iealous in France.
1504  *<S {Page}.> Nay follow him (Gentlemen) see the yssue of
1505   his search.
1506   <S {Mist.Page}.> Is there not a double excellency in this?
1507   <S {Mist.Ford}.> I know not which pleases me better,
1508   That my husband is deceiued, or Sir {Iohn}.
1509  *<S {Mist.Page}.> What a taking was hee in, when your
1510   husband askt who was in the basket?
1511  *<S {Mist.Ford}.>  I am halfe affraid he will haue neede of
1512  *washing: so throwing him into the water, will doe him
1513   a benefit.
1514  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Hang him dishonest rascall: I would all
1515   of the same straine, were in the same distresse.
1516  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> I thinke my husband hath some speciall
1517  *suspition of {Falstaffs} being heere: for I neuer saw him so
1518   grosse in his iealousie till now.
1519  *<S {Mist.Page}.> I will lay a plot to try that, and wee will
1520  *yet haue more trickes with {Falstaffe}: his dissolute disease
1521   will scarse obey this medicine.
1522  *<S {Mis.Ford}.> Shall we send that foolishion Carion, Mist[ris].
1523  *{Quickly} to him, and excuse his throwing into the water,
1524  *and giue him another hope, to betray him to another
1525   punishment?
1526  *<S {Mist.Page}.> We will do it: let him be sent for to mor-row
1527   eight #a clocke to haue amends.
1528  *<S {Ford}.> I cannot finde him: may be the knaue bragg'd
1529   of that he could not compasse.
1530   <S {Mis.Page}.> Heard you that?
1531   <S {Mis.Ford}.> You vse me well, M[aster]. {Ford}? Do you?
1532   <S {Ford}.> #I, I do so.
1533  *<S {M.Ford}.> Heauen make you better then your thoghts
1534   <S {Ford}.> Amen.
1535  *<S {Mi.Page}.> You do your selfe mighty wrong (M[aster]. {Ford})
1536   <S {Ford}.> #I, #I: I must beare it.
1537  *<S {Eu}.> If there be any pody in the house, & in the cham-bers,
1538  *and in the coffers, and in the presses: heauen for-giue
1539   my sins at the day of iudgement.
1540   <S {Caius}.> Be gar, nor I too: there is no- bodies.
1541  *<S {Page}.> Fy, fy, M[aster]. {Ford}, are you not asham'd? What spi-rit,
1542  *what diuell suggests this imagination? I wold not #ha
1543  *your distemper in this kind, for y welth of {Windsor castle}.
1544   <S {Ford}.> 'Tis my fault (M[aster]. {Page}) I suffer for it.
1545  *<S {Euans}.> You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is
1546  *as honest a o'mans, as I will desires among fiue thou-sand,
1547   and fiue hundred too.
1548   <S {Cai}.> By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
1549  *<S {Ford}.> Well, I promisd you a dinner: come, come, walk
1550  *in the Parke, I pray you pardon me: I wil hereafter make
1551  *knowne to you why I haue done this. Come wife, come
1552   Mi[stris]. {Page}, I pray you pardon me. Pray hartly pardon me.
1553  *<S {Page}.> Let's go in Gentlemen, but (trust me) #we'l mock
1554  *him: I doe inuite you to morrow morning to my house
1555  *to breakfast: after #we'll #a Birding together, I haue a fine
1556   Hawke for the bush. Shall it be so:
1557   <S {Ford}.> Any thing.
1558  *<S {Eu}.> If there is one, I shall make two in the Companie
1559  *<S {Ca}.> If there be one, or two, I shall make- a- the#turd.
1560   <S {Ford}.> Pray you go, M[aster]. {Page}.
1561  *<S {Eua}.> I pray you now remembrance to morrow on the
1562   lowsie knaue, mine Host.
1563   <S {Cai}.> Dat is good by gar, withall my heart.
1564  *<S {Eua}.> A lowsie knaue, to haue his gibes, and his moc-keries.

1570   Therefore no more turne me to him (sweet Nan.)
1571   <S {Anne}.> Alas, how then?
1572   <S {Fen}.> Why thou must be thy selfe.
1573   He doth obiect, I am too great of birth,
1574   And that my state being gall'd with my expence,
1575   I seeke to heale it onely by his wealth.
1576   Besides these, other barres he layes before me,
1577   My Riots past, my wilde Societies,
1578   And tels me 'tis a thing impossible
1579   I should loue thee, but as a property.
1580   <S {An}.> May be he tels you true.
1581   No, heauen so speed me in my time to come,
1582   Albeit I will confesse, thy Fathers wealth
1583   Was the first motiue that I woo'd thee ({Anne}:)
1584   Yet wooing thee, I found thee of more valew
1585   Then stampes in Gold, or summes in sealed bagges:
1586   And 'tis the very riches of thy selfe,
1587   That now I ayme at.
1588   <S {An}.> Gentle M[aster]. {Fenton},
1589   Yet seeke my Fathers loue, still seeke it sir,
1590   If opportunity and humblest suite
1591   Cannot attaine it, why then harke you hither.

1598  *<S {Qui}.> Hark ye, M[aster]. {Slender} would speak a word with you

1615  *<S {Shal}.> He will make you a hundred and fiftie pounds
1616   ioynture.
1617  *<S {Anne}.> Good Maister {Shallow} let him woo for him-selfe.

      <P E2v>
1628  *<S {Anne}.> I meane (M[aster]. {Slender}) what wold you with me?
1629  *<S {Slen}.> Truely, for mine owne part, I would little or

1631  *motions: if it be my lucke, so; if not, happy man bee his
1632  *dole, they can tell you how things go, better then I can:
1633   you may aske your father, heere he comes.

1635   Why how now? What does Mr {Fenten} here?
1636   You wrong me Sir, thus still to haunt my house.
1637   I told you Sir, my daughter is disposd of.
1638   <S {Fen}.> Nay Mr {Page}, be not impatient.
1639  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Good M[aster]. {Fenton}, come not to my child.
1640   <S {Page}.> She is no match for you.
1641   <S {Fen}.> Sir, will you heare me?
1642   <S {Page}.> No, good M[aster]. {Fenton}.
1643   Come M[aster]. {Shallow}: Come sonne {Slender}, in;
1644   Knowing my minde, you wrong me (M[aster]. {Fenton}.)
1645   <S {Qui}.> Speake to Mistris {Page}.
1646  *<S {Fen}.> Good Mist[ris]. {Page}, for that I loue your daughter
1647   In such a righteous fashion as I do,
1648   Perforce, against all checkes, rebukes, and manners,
1649   I must aduance the colours of my loue,
1650   And not retire. Let me haue your good #will.
1651  *<S {An}.> Good mother, do not marry me to yond foole.
1652  *<S {Mist.Page}.> I meane it not, I seeke you a better hus-band.
1653  _
1654   <S {Qui}.> That's my master, M[aster]. Doctor.
1655   <S {An}.> Alas I had rather be set quick i'th earth,
1656   And bowl'd to death with Turnips.
1657  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Come, trouble not your selfe good M[aster].
1658   {#Fenton}, I will not be your friend, nor enemy:
1659   My daughter will I question how she loues you,
1660   And as I finde her, so am I affected:
1661   Till then, farewell Sir, she must needs go in,
1662   Her father will be angry.
1663   <S {Fen}.> Farewell gentle Mistris: farewell {Nan}.
1664  *<S {Qui}.> This is my doing now: Nay, saide I, will you
1665   cast away your childe on a Foole, and a Physitian:
1666   Looke on M[aster]. {Fenton}, this is my doing.
1667   <S {Fen}.> I thanke thee: and I pray thee once to night,
1668   Giue my sweet {Nan} this Ring: there's for thy paines.
1669  *<S {Qui}.> Now heauen send thee good fortune, a kinde
1670  *heart he hath: a woman would run through fire & wa-ter
1671  *for such a kinde heart. But yet, I would my Maister
1672  *had Mistris {Anne}, or I would M[aster]. {Slender} had her: or (in
1673  *sooth) I would M[aster]. {Fenton} had her; I will do what I can
1674  *for them all three, for so I haue promisd, and Ile bee as
1675  *good as my word, but speciously for M[aster]. {Fenton}. Well, I
1676  *must of another errand to Sir {Iohn Falstaffe} from my two
1677   Mistresses: what a beast am I to slacke it.  <D {Exeunt}>

1683  *Haue I liu'd to be carried in a Basket like a barrow of
1684  *butchers Offall?  and to be throwne in the Thames? Wel,

1686  *'tane out and butter'd, and giue them to a dogge for a
1687  *New- yeares gift. The rogues slighted me into the riuer
1688  *with as little remorse, as they would haue drown'de a
1689  *blinde bitches Puppies, fifteene i'th litter: and you may
1690  *know by my size, that I haue a kinde of alacrity in sink-ing:
1691  *if the bottome were as deepe as #hell, I shold down.
1692  *I had beene drown'd, but that the shore was sheluy and
1693  *shallow: a death that I abhorre: for the water swelles a
1694  *man; and what a thing should I haue beene, when I
1695  *had beene swel'd? I should haue beene a Mountaine of
1696   Mummie.
1697   <S {Bar}.> Here's M[istris]. {Quickly} Sir to speake with you.
1698  *<S {Fal}.> Come, let me poure in some Sack to the Thames
1699  *water: for my bellies as cold as if I had swallow'd snow-bals,
1700   for pilles to coole the reines. Call her in.
1701   <S {Bar}.> Come in woman.
1702   <S {Qui}.> By your leaue: I cry you mercy?
1703   Giue your worship good morrow.
1704   <S {Fal}.> Take away these Challices:
1705   Go, brew me a pottle of Sacke finely.
1706   <S {Bard}.> With Egges, Sir?
1707  *<S {Fal}.> Simple of it selfe: Ile no Pullet- Spersme in my
1708   brewage. How now?
1709  *<S {Qui}.> Marry Sir, I come to your worship from M[istris]. {Ford}.
1710  *<S {Fal}.> {Mist[ris]}. {Ford}? I haue had Ford enough: I was thrown
1711   into the Ford; I haue my belly full of Ford.
1712  *<S {Qui}.> Alas the day, (good- heart) that was not her
1713  *fault: she do's so take on with her men; they mistooke
1714   their erection.
1715  *<S {Fal}.> So did I mine, to build vpon a foolish Womans |(promise.
1716  *<S {Qui}.> Well, she laments Sir for it, that it would yern
1717  *your heart to see it: her husband goes this morning #a
1718  *birding; she desires you once more to come to her, be-tweene
1719  *eight and nine: I must carry her word quickely,
1720   she'll make you amends I warrant you.
1721  *<S {Fal}.> Well, I will visit her, tell her so: and bidde her
1722  *thinke what a man is: Let her consider his frailety, and
1723   then iudge of my merit.
1724   <S {Qui}.> I will tell her.
1725   <S {Fal}.> Do so. Betweene nine and ten saist thou?
1726   <S {Qui}.> Eight and nine Sir.
1727   <S {Fal}.> Well, be gone: I will not misse her.
1728   <S {Qui}.> Peace be with you Sir.
1729  *<S {Fal}.> I meruaile I heare not of Mr {Broome}: he sent me
1730   word to stay within: I like his money well.
1731   Oh, heere he comes.
1732   <S {Ford}.> Blesse you Sir.
1733   <S {Fal}.> Now M[aster]. {Broome}, you come to know
1734   What hath past betweene me, and {Fords} wife.
1735   <S {Ford}.> That indeed (Sir {Iohn}) is my businesse.
1736   <S {Fal}.> M[aster]. {Broome} I will not lye to you,
1737   I was at her house the houre she appointed me.
1738   <S {Ford}.> And sped you Sir?
1739   <S {Fal}.> Very ill- fauouredly M[aster]. {Broome}.
1740  *<S {Ford}.> How so sir, did she change her determination?
1741  *<S {Fal}.> No (M[aster]. {Broome}) but the peaking Curnuto her hus-band
1742  *(M[aster]. {Broome}) dwelling in a continual larum of ielou-sie,
1743  *coms me in the instant of our encounter, after we had
1744  *embrast, kist, protested, & (as it were) spoke the prologue
1745  *of our Comedy: and at his heeles, a rabble of his compa-nions,
1746  *thither prouoked and instigated by his distemper,
1747   and (forsooth) to serch his house for his wiues Loue.
1748   <S {Ford}.> What? While you were there?
1749   <S {Fal}.> While I was there.
1750  *<S {For}.> And did he search for you, & could not find you?
1751  *<S {Fal}.> You shall heare. As good lucke would haue it,
1752  *comes in one {Mist[ris]}. {Page}, giues intelligence of {Fords} ap-proch:
1753  *and in her inuention, and {Fords} wiues distraction,
1754   they conuey'd me into a bucke- basket.
      <P E3><C C>
1755   <S {Ford}.> A Buck- basket?
1756  *<S {Fal}.> Yes: a Buck- basket: ram'd mee in with foule
1757  *Shirts and Smockes, Socks, foule Stockings, greasie
1758  *Napkins, that (Master {Broome}) there was the rankest
1759  *compound of villanous smell, that euer offended no-strill.
1760  _
1761   <S {Ford}.> And how long lay you there?
1762  *<S {Fal}.> Nay, you shall heare (Master {Broome}) what I
1763  *haue sufferd, to bring this woman to euill, for your
1764  *good: Being thus cram'd in  the Basket, a couple of
1765  *{Fords} knaues, his Hindes, were cald forth  by their Mi-stris,
1766  *to carry mee in the name of foule Cloathes to
1767  *{Datchet- lane}: they tooke me on their shoulders: met
1768  *the iealous knaue their Master in the doore; who
1769  *ask'd them once or twice what they had in their Bas-ket?
1770  *I quak'd for feare least the Lunatique Knaue
1771  *would haue search'd it: but Fate (ordaining he should
1772  *be a Cuckold) held his hand: well, on went hee, for
1773  *a search, and away went I for foule Cloathes: But
1774  *marke the sequell (Master {Broome}) I suffered the pangs
1775  *of three seuerall deaths: First, an intollerable fright,
1776  *to be detected with a iealious rotten Bell- weather:
1777  *Next to be compass'd like a good Bilbo in the circum-ference
1778  *of a Pecke, hilt to point, heele to head. And
1779  *then to be stopt in like a strong distillation with stink-ing
1780  *Cloathes, that fretted in their owne grease:
1781  *thinke of that, a man of my Kidney; thinke of that,
1782  *that am as subiect to heate as butter; a man of conti-nuall
1783  *dissolution, and thaw: it was a miracle to scape
1784  *suffocation. And in the height of this Bath (when I
1785  *was more then halfe stew'd in grease (like a Dutch- dish)
1786  *to be throwne into the Thames, and
1787  *coold, glowing- hot, in that serge like a Horse- shoo;
1788  *thinke of that; hissing hot: thinke of that (Master
1789   {Broome}.)
1790  *<S {Ford}.> In good sadnesse Sir, I am sorry, that for my sake
1791   you haue sufferd all this.
1792  *My suite then is desperate: You'll vndertake her no
1793   more?
1794  *<S {Fal}.> Master {Broome}: I will be throwne into {Etna},
1795  *as I haue beene into Thames, ere I will leaue her thus;
1796  *her Husband is this morning gone #a Birding: I
1797  *haue receiued from her another ambassie of mee-ting:
1798  *'twixt eight and nine is the houre (Master
1799   {Broome}.)
1800   <S {Ford}.> 'Tis past eight already Sir.
1801  *<S {Fal}.> Is it? I will then addresse mee to my appoint-ment:
1802  *Come to mee at your conuenient leisure, and
1803  *you shall know how I speede: and the conclusion
1804  *shall be crowned with your enioying her: adiew: you
1805  *shall haue her (Master {Broome}) Master {Broome}, you shall
1806   cuckold {Ford}.
1807  *<S {Ford}.> Hum: ha? Is this a vision? Is this a dreame?
1808  *doe I sleepe? Master {Ford} awake, awake Master {Ford}:
1809  *ther's a hole made in your best coate (Master {Ford}:) this
1810  *'tis to be married; this 'tis to haue Lynnen, and Buck-baskets:
1811  *Well, I will proclaime my selfe what I am:
1812  *I will now take the Leacher: hee is at my house: hee
1813  *cannot scape me: 'tis impossible hee should: hee can-not
1814  *creepe into a halfe- penny purse, nor into a Pepper-Boxe:
1815  *But least the Diuell that guides him, should
1816  *aide him, I will search impossible places: though
1817  *what I am, I cannot auoide; yet to be what I would
1818  *not, shall not make me tame: If I haue hornes, to make
1819  *one mad, let the prouerbe goe with me, Ile be horne-mad.

1901  *<S {Fal}.> {Mi[stris]}.  {Ford}, Your sorrow hath eaten vp my suffe-rance;
1902  *I see you are obsequious in your loue, and I pro-fesse
1903  *requitall to a haires bredth, not onely Mist[ris]. {Ford},

1906   your husband now?
1907   <S {Mis.Ford}.> Hee's #a birding (sweet Sir {Iohn}.)
1908   <S {Mis.Page}.> What hoa, gossip {Ford}: what hoa.
1909   <S {Mis.Ford}.> Step into th' chamber, Sir {Iohn}.
1910  *<S {Mis.Page}.> How now (sweete heart) whose at home
1911   besides your selfe?
1912   <S {Mis.Ford}.> Why none but mine owne people.
1913   <S {Mis.Page}.> Indeed?
1914   <S {Mis.Ford}.> No certainly: Speake louder.
1915  *<S {Mist.Pag}.> Truly, I am so glad you haue no body here.
1916   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Why?
1917  *<S {Mis.Page}.> Why woman, your husband is in his olde
1918  *lines againe: he so takes on yonder with my husband, so
1919  *railes against all married mankinde; so curses all {Eues}
1920  *daughters, of what complexion soeuer; and so buffettes
1921  *himselfe on the for- head: crying peere- out, peere- out,
1922  *that any madnesse I euer yet beheld, seem'd but tame-nesse,
1923  *ciuility, and patience to this his distemper he is in
1924   now: I am glad the fat Knight is not heere.
1925   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Why, do's he talke of him?
1926  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Of none but him, and sweares he was ca-ried
1927  *out the last time hee search'd for him, in a Basket:
1928  *Protests to my husband he is now heere, & hath drawne
1929  *him and the rest of their company from their sport, to
1930  *make another experiment of his suspition: But I am glad
1931  *the Knight is not heere; now he shall see his owne foo-lerie.
1932  _
1933   <S {Mist.Ford}.> How neere is he Mistris {Page}?
1934  *<S {Mist.Pag}.> Hard by, at street end; he wil be here anon.
1935   <S {Mist.Ford}.> I am vndone, the Knight is heere.
1936  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Why then you are vtterly sham'd, & hee's
1937  *but a dead man. What a woman are you? Away with
1938   him, away with him: Better shame, then murther.
1939  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Which way should he go? How should I
1940   bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket againe?
1941   <S {Fal}.> No, Ile come no more i'th Basket:
1942   May I not go out ere he come?
1943  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Alas: three of  Mr. {Fords} brothers watch
1944  *the doore with Pistols, that none shall issue out: other-wise
1945  *you might slip away ere hee came: But what make
1946   you heere?
1947  *<S {Fal}.> What shall I do? Ile creepe vp into the chimney.
1948  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> There they alwaies vse to discharge their
1949   Birding- peeces: creepe into the Kill- hole.
1950   <S {Fal}.> Where is it?
1951  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> He will seeke there on my word: Neyther
1952  *Presse, Coffer, Chest, Trunke, Well, Vault, but he hath
1953  *an abstract for the remembrance of such places, and goes
1954  *to them by his Note: There is no hiding you in the
1955   house.
1956   <S {Fal}.> Ile go out then.
1957  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> If you goe out in your owne semblance,
1958   you die Sir {Iohn}, vnlesse you go out disguis'd.
1959   <S {Mist.Ford}.> How might we disguise him?
1960  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Alas the day I know not, there is no wo-mans
1961  *gowne bigge enough for him: otherwise he might
1962   put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchiefe, and so escape.
1963  *<S {Fal}.> Good hearts, deuise something: any extremitie,
1964   rather then a mischiefe.
1965  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> My Maids Aunt the fat woman of {Brain-ford},
1966   has a gowne aboue.
1967  *<S {Mist.Page}.> On my word it will serue him: shee's as
1968  *big as he is: and there's her thrum'd hat, and her muffler
1969   too: run vp Sir {Iohn}.
1970  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Go, go, sweet Sir {Iohn}: {Mistris Page} and
1971   I will looke some linnen for your head.
1972  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Quicke, quicke, wee'le come dresse you
1973   straight: put on the gowne the while.
1974  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> I would my husband would meete him
1975  *in this shape: he cannot abide the old woman of Brain-ford;
1976  *he sweares she's a witch, forbad her my house, and
1977   hath threatned to beate her.
1978  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Heauen guide him to thy husbands cud-gell:
1979   and the diuell guide his cudgell afterwards.
1980   <S {Mist.Ford}.> But is my husband comming?
1981  *<S {Mist.Page}.> #I in good sadnesse is he, and talkes of the
1982   basket too, howsoeuer he hath had intelligence.
1983  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Wee'l try that: for Ile appoint my men to
1984  *carry the basket againe, to meete him at the doore with
1985   it, as they did last time.
1986  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Nay, but hee'l be heere presently: let's go
1987   dresse him like the witch of {Brainford}.
1988  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Ile first direct my men, what they
1989  *shall doe with the basket: Goe vp, Ile bring linnen for
1990   him straight.
1991   <S {Mist.Page}.> Hang him dishonest Varlet,
1992   We cannot misuse enough:
1993   #We'll leaue a proofe by that which we will doo,
1994   Wiues may be merry, and yet honest too:
1995   We do not acte that often, iest, and laugh,
1996   'Tis old, but true, Still Swine eats all the draugh.
1997  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Go Sirs, take the basket againe on your
1998  *shoulders: your Master is hard at doore: if hee bid you
1999   set it downe, obey him: quickly, dispatch.
2000   <S 1 {Ser}.> Come, come, take it vp.
2001   <S 2 {Ser}.> Pray heauen it be not full of Knight againe.
2002   <S 1 {Ser}.> I hope not, I had liefe as beare so much lead.
2003  *<S {Ford}.> #I, but if it proue true (Mr. {Page}) haue you any
2004  *way then to vnfoole me againe. Set downe the basket
2005  *villaine: some body call my wife: Youth in a basket:
2006  *Oh you Panderly Rascals, there's a knot: a gin, a packe,
2007  *a conspiracie against me: Now shall the diuel be sham'd.
2008  *What wife I say: Come, come forth: behold what ho-nest
      <P E4>
2009   cloathes you send forth to bleaching.
2010  *<S {Page}.> Why, this passes M[aster]. {Ford}: you are not to goe
2011   loose any longer, you must be pinnion'd.
2012  *<S {Euans}.> Why, this is Lunaticks: this is madde, as a
2013   mad dogge.
2014   <S {Shall}.> Indeed {M[aster]}. {Ford}, this is not well indeed.
2015  *<S {Ford}.> So say I too Sir, come hither Mistris {Ford}, Mi-stris
2016  *{#Ford}, the honest woman, the modest wife, the vertu-ous
2017  *creature, that hath the iealious foole to her husband:
2018   I suspect without cause (Mistris) do I?
2019  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Heauen be my witnesse you doe, if you
2020   suspect me in any dishonesty.
2021  *<S {Ford}.> Well said Brazon- face, hold it out: Come forth
2022   sirrah.
2023   <S {Page}.> This passes.
2024  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Are you not asham'd, let the cloths alone.
2025   <S {Ford}.> I shall finde you anon.
2026  *<S {Eua}.> 'Tis vnreasonable; will you take vp your wiues
2027   cloathes? Come, away.
2028   <S {Ford}.> Empty the basket I say.
2029   <S {M.Ford}.> Why man, why?
2030  *<S {Ford}.> Master {Page}, as I am a man, there was one con-uay'd
2031  *out of my house yesterday in this basket: why
2032  *may not he be there againe, in my house I am sure he is:
2033  *my Intelligence is true, my iealousie is reasonable, pluck
2034   me out all the linnen.
2035  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> If you find a man there, he shall dye a Fleas
2036   death.
2037   <S {Page}.> Heer's no man.
2038  *<S {Shal}.> By my fidelity this is not well Mr. {Ford}: This
2039   wrongs you.
2040  *<S {Euans}.> Mr {Ford}, you must pray, and not follow the
2041   imaginations of your owne heart: this is iealousies.
2042   <S {Ford}.> Well, hee's not heere I seeke for.
2043   <S {Page}.> No, nor no where else but in your braine.
2044  *<S {Ford}.> Helpe to search my house this one time: if I find
2045  *not what I seeke, shew no colour for my extremity: Let
2046  *me for euer be your Table- sport: Let them say of me, as
2047  *iealous as {Ford}, that search'd a hollow Wall- nut for his
2048  *wiues Lemman. Satisfie me once more, once more serch
2049   with me.
2050  *<S {M.Ford}.> What hoa (Mistris {Page},) come you and
2051  *the old woman downe: my husband will come into the
2052   Chamber.
2053   <S {Ford}.> Old woman? what old womans that?
2054   <S {M.Ford}.> Why it is my maids Aunt of {Brainford}.
2055  *<S {Ford}.> A witch, a Queane, an olde couzening queane:
2056  *Haue I not forbid her my house. She comes of errands
2057  *do's she? We are simple men, wee doe not know what's
2058  *brought to passe vnder the profession of Fortune- telling.
2059  *She workes by Charmes, by Spels, by th' Figure,  & such
2060  *dawbry as this is, beyond our Element: wee know no-thing.
2061  *Come downe you Witch, you Hagge you, come
2062   downe I say.
2063  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Nay, good sweet husband, good Gentle-men,
2064   let him strike the old woman.
2065  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Come mother {Prat}, Come giue me your
2066   hand.
2067  *<S {Ford}.> Ile {Prat}- her: Out of my doore, you Witch,
2068  *you Ragge, you Baggage, you Poulcat, you Runnion,
2069   out, out: Ile coniure you, Ile fortune- tell you.
2070   <S {Mist.Page}.> Are you not asham'd?
2071   I thinke you haue kill'd the poore woman.
2072  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Nay he will do it, 'tis a goodly credite
2073   for you.
2074   <S {Ford}.> Hang her witch.
2075  *<S {Eua}.> By yea, and no, I thinke the o'man is a witch in-deede:
2076  *I like not when a o'man has a great peard; I spie
2077   a great peard vnder his muffler.
2078  *<S {Ford}.> Will you follow Gentlemen, I beseech you fol-low:
2079  *see but the issue of my iealousie: If I cry out thus
2080   vpon no traile, neuer trust me when I open againe.
2081   <S {Page}.> Let's obey his humour a little further:
2082   Come Gentlemen.
2083   <S {Mist.Page}.> Trust me he beate him most pittifully.
2084  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Nay by th' Masse that he did not: he beate
2085   him most vnpittifully, me thought.
2086  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Ile haue the cudgell hallow'd, and hung
2087   ore the Altar, it hath done meritorious seruice.
2088  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> What thinke you? May we with the war-rant
2089  *of woman- hood, and the witnesse of a good consci-ence,
2090   pursue him with any further reuenge?
2091  *<S {M.Page}.> The spirit of wantonnesse is sure scar'd out
2092  *of him, if the diuell haue him not in fee- simple, with
2093  *fine and recouery, he will neuer (I thinke) in the way of
2094   waste, attempt vs againe.
2095  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Shall we tell our husbands how wee haue
2096   seru'd him?
2097  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Yes, by all meanes: if it be but to scrape
2098  *the figures out of your husbands braines: if they can find
2099  *in their hearts, the poore vnuertuous fat Knight shall be
2100  *any further afflicted, wee two will still bee the mini-sters.
2101  _
2102  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Ile warrant, they'l haue him publiquely
2103  *sham'd, and me thinkes there would be no period to the
2104   iest, should he not be publikely sham'd.
2105  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Come, to the Forge with it, then shape it:
2106   I would not haue things coole.  <D {Exeunt}>
2107   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2108   <D {Enter Host and Bardolfe}.>
2109  *<S {Bar}.> Sir, the Germane desires to haue three of your
2110  *horses: the Duke himselfe will be to morrow at Court,
2111   and they are going to meet him.
2112  *<S {Host}.> What Duke should that be comes so secretly?
2113  *I heare not of him in the Court: let mee speake with the
2114   Gentlemen, they speake English?
2115   <S {Bar}.> #I Sir? Ile call him to you.
2116  *<S {Host}.> They shall haue my horses, but Ile make them
2117  *pay: Ile sauce them, they haue had my houses a week at
2118  *commaund: I haue turn'd away my other guests, they
2119   must come off, Ile sawce them, come.  <D {Exeunt}>
2120   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2121   <D {Enter Page, Ford, Mistris Page, Mistris}
2122   {Ford, and Euans}.>
2123  *<S {Eua}.> 'Tis one of the best discretions of a o'man as e-uer
2124   I did looke vpon.
2125  *<S {Page}.> And did he send you both these Letters at an
2126   instant?
2127   <S {Mist.Page}.> Within a quarter of an houre.
2128  *<S {Ford}.> Pardon me (wife) henceforth do what y wilt:
2129   I rather will suspect the Sunne with gold,
2130  *Then thee with wantonnes: Now doth thy honor stand
      <P E4v>
2131   (In him that was of late an Heretike)
2132   As firme as faith.
2133   <S {Page}.> 'Tis well, 'tis well, no more:
2134   Be not as extreme in submission, as in offence,
2135   But let our plot go forward: Let our wiues
2136   Yet once againe (to make vs publike sport)
2137   Appoint a meeting with this old fat- fellow,
2138   Where we may take him, and disgrace him for it.
2139  *<S {Ford}.> There is no better way then that they spoke of.
2140  *<S {Page}.> How? to send him word they'll meete him in
2141   the Parke at midnight? Fie, fie, he'll neuer come.
2142  *<S {Eu}.> You say he has bin throwne in the Riuers: and
2143  *has bin greeuously peaten, as an old o'man: me- thinkes
2144  *there should be terrors in him, that he should not come:
2145  *Me- thinkes his flesh is punish'd, hee shall haue no de-sires.
2146  _
2147   <S {Page}.> So thinke I too.
2148  *<S {M.Ford}.> Deuise but how you'l vse him whe[n] he comes,
2149   And let vs two deuise to bring him thether.
2150  *<S {Mis.Page}.> There is an old tale goes, that {Herne} the
2151   Hunter (sometime a keeper heere in Windsor Forrest)
2152   Doth all the winter time, at still midnight
2153   Walke round about an Oake, with great rag'd- hornes,
2154   And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
2155   And make milch- kine yeeld blood, and shakes a chaine
2156   In a most hideous and dreadfull manner.
2157   You haue heard of such a Spirit, and well you know
2158   The superstitious idle- headed- Eld
2159   Receiu'd, and did deliuer to our age
2160   This tale of {Herne} the Hunter, for a truth.
2161   <S {Page}.> Why yet there want not many that do feare
2162   In deepe of night to walke by this Hernes Oake:
2163   But what of this?
2164   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Marry this is our deuise,
2165   That {Falstaffe} at that Oake shall meete with vs.
2166   <S {Page}.> Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,
2167  *And in this shape, when you haue brought him thether,
2168   What shall be done with him? What is your plot?
2169  *<S {Mist.Pa}.> That likewise haue we thoght vpon: & thus:
2170   {Nan Page} (my daughter) and my little sonne,
2171   And three or foure more of their growth, wee'l dresse
2172   Like Vrchins, Ouphes, and Fairies, greene and white,
2173   With rounds of waxen Tapers on their heads,
2174   And rattles in their hands; vpon a sodaine,
2175   As {Falstaffe}, she, and I, are newly met,
2176   Let them from forth a saw- pit rush at once
2177   With some diffused song: Vpon their sight
2178   We two, in great amazednesse will flye:
2179   Then let them all encircle him about,
2180   And Fairy- like to pinch the vncleane Knight;
2181   And aske him why that houre of Fairy Reuell,
2182   In their so sacred pathes, he dares to tread
2183   In shape prophane.
2184   <S {Ford}.> And till he tell the truth,
2185   Let the supposed Fairies pinch him, sound,
2186   And burne him with their Tapers.
2187   <S {Mist.Page}.> The truth being knowne,
2188   #We'll all present our selues; dis- horne the spirit,
2189   And mocke him home to Windsor.
2190   <S {Ford}.> The children must
2191   Be practis'd well to this, or they'll neu'r doo't.
2192  *<S {Eua}.> I will teach the children their behauiours: and I
2193  *will be like a Iacke- an- Apes also, to burne the Knight
2194   with my Taber.
2195   <S {Ford}.> That will be excellent,
2196   Ile go buy them vizards.
2197  *<S {Mist.Page}.> My {Nan} shall be the Queene of all the
2198   Fairies, finely attired in a robe of white.
2199   <S {Page}.> That silke will I go buy, and in that time
2200   Shall M[aster]. {Slender} steale my {Nan} away,
2201   And marry her at {Eaton}: go, send to {Falstaffe} straight.
2202   <S {Ford}.> Nay, Ile to him againe in name of {Broome},
2203   Hee'l tell me all his purpose: sure hee'l come.
2204  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Feare not you that: Go get vs properties
2205   And tricking for our Fayries.
2206   <S {Euans}.> Let vs about it,
2207   It is admirable pleasures, and ferry honest knaueries.
2208   <S {Mis.Page}.> Go {Mist[ris]}. {Ford},
2209   Send quickly to Sir {Iohn}, to know his minde:
2210   Ile to the Doctor, he hath my good #will,
2211   And none but he to marry with {Nan Page}:
2212   That {Slender} (though well landed) is an Ideot:
2213   And he, my husband best of all affects:
2214   The Doctor is well monied, and his friends
2215   Potent at Court: he, none but he shall haue her,
2216   Though twenty thousand worthier come to craue her.
2217   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
2218   <D {Enter Host, Simple, Falstaffe, Bardolfe, Euans},
2219   {Caius, Quickly}.>
2220  *<S {Host}.> What wouldst thou haue? (Boore) what? (thick
2221  *skin) speake, breathe, discusse: breefe, short, quicke,
2222   snap.
2223  *<S {Simp}.> Marry Sir, I come to speake with Sir {Iohn Fal-staffe}
2224   from M[aster]. {Slender}.
2225  *<S {Host}.> There's his Chamber, his House, his Castle,
2226  *his standing- bed and truckle- bed: 'tis painted about
2227  *with the story of the Prodigall, fresh and new: go, knock
2228  *and call: hee'l speake like an Anthropophaginian vnto
2229   thee: Knocke I say.
2230  *<S {Simp}.> There's an olde woman, a fat woman gone vp
2231  *into his chamber: Ile be so bold as stay Sir till she come
2232   downe: I come to speake with her indeed.
2233  *<S {Host}.> Ha? A fat woman? The Knight may be robb'd:
2234  *Ile call. Bully- Knight, Bully Sir {Iohn}: speake from thy
2235  *Lungs Military: Art thou there? It is thine Host, thine
2236   Ephesian cals.
2237   <S {Fal}.> How now, mine Host?
2238  *<S {Host}.> Here's a Bohemian- Tartar taries the comming
2239  *downe of thy fat- woman: Let her descend (Bully) let
2240  *her descend: my Chambers are honourable: Fie, priua-cy?
2241   Fie.
2242  *<S {Fal}.> There was (mine Host) an old- fat- woman euen
2243   now with me, but she's gone.
2244  *<S {Simp}.> Pray you Sir, #was't not the Wise- woman of
2245   {Brainford}?
2246  *<S {Fal}.> #I marry was it (Mussel- shell) what would you
2247   with her?
2248  *<S {Simp}.> My Master (Sir) my master {Slender}, sent to her
2249  *seeing her go thorough the streets, to know (Sir) whe-ther
2250  *one {Nim} (Sir) that beguil'd him of a chaine, had the
2251   chaine, or no.
2252   <S {Fal}.> I spake with the old woman about it.
2253   <S {Sim}.> And what sayes she, I pray Sir?
2254  *<S {Fal}.> Marry shee sayes, that the very same man that
2255  *beguil'd Master {Slender} of his Chaine, cozon'd him of it.
2256  *<S {Simp}.> I would I could haue spoken with the Woman
      <P E5><C D>
2257  *her selfe, I had other things to haue spoken with her
2258   too, from him.
2259   <S {Fal}.> What are they? let vs know.
2260   <S {Host}.> #I: come: quicke.
2261   <S {Fal}.> I may not conceale them (Sir.)
2262   <S {Host}.> Conceale them, or thou di'st.
2263  *<S {Sim}.> Why sir, they were nothing but about Mistris
2264  *{#Anne Page}, to know if it were my Masters fortune to
2265   haue her, or no.
2266   <S {Fal}.> 'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
2267   <S {Sim}.> What Sir?
2268  *<S {Fal}.> To haue her, or no: goe; say the woman told
2269   me so.
2270   <S {Sim}.> May I be bold to say so Sir?
2271   <S {Fal}.> #I Sir: like who more bold.
2272  *<S {Sim}.> I thanke your worship: I shall make my Master
2273   glad with these tydings.
2274  *<S {Host}.> Thou art clearkly: thou art clearkly (Sir {Iohn})
2275   was there a wise woman with thee?
2276  *<S {Fal}.> #I that there was (mine {Host}) one that hath taught
2277  *me more wit, then euer I learn'd before in my life: and
2278  *I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my lear-ning.
2279  _
2280   <S {Bar}.> Out alas (Sir) cozonage: meere cozonage.
2281  *<S {Host}.> Where be my horses? speake well of them var-letto.
2282  _
2283  *<S {Bar}.> Run away with the cozoners: for so soone as
2284  *I came beyond {Eaton}, they threw me off, from behinde
2285  *one of them, in a slough of myre; and set spurres, and
2286  *away; like three {Germane}- diuels; three {Doctor Fau-stasses}.
2287  _
2288  *<S {Host}.> They are gone but to meete the Duke (villaine)
2289   doe not say they be fled: {Germanes} are honest men.
2290   <S {Euan}.> Where is mine {Host}?
2291   <S {Host}.> What is the matter Sir?
2292  *<S {Euan}.> Haue a care of your entertainments: there is a
2293  *friend of mine come to Towne, tels mee there is three
2294  *Cozen- Iermans, that has cozend all the {Hosts} of {Reading},
2295  *of {Maidenhead}; of {Cole- brooke}, of horses and money: I
2296  *tell you for good #will (looke you) you are wise, and full
2297  *of gibes, and vlouting- stocks: and 'tis not conuenient
2298   you should be cozoned. Fare you well.
2299   <S {Cai}.> Ver' is mine {Host de Iarteere}?
2300  *<S {Host}.> Here (Master {Doctor}) in perplexitie, and doubt-full
2301   delemma.
2302  *<S {Cai}.> I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell- a- me, dat
2303  *you make grand preparation for a Duke {de Iamanie}: by
2304  *my trot: der is no Duke that the Court is know, to

2306  *<S {Host}.> Huy and cry, (villaine) goe: assist me Knight, I
2307  *am vndone: fly, run: huy, and cry (villaine) I am vn-done.
2308  _
2309  *<S {Fal}.> I would all the world might be cozond, for I
2310  *haue beene cozond and beaten too: if it should come
2311  *to the eare of the Court, how I haue beene transformed;
2312  *and how my transformation hath beene washd, and
2313  *cudgeld, they would melt mee out of my fat drop by
2314  *drop, and liquor Fishermens- boots with me: I warrant
2315  *they would whip me with their fine wits, till I were as
2316  *crest- falne as a dride- peare: I neuer prosper'd, since I
2317  *forswore my selfe at {Primero}: well, if my winde were
2318  *but long enough; I would repent: Now? Whence come
2319   you?
2320   <S {Qui}.> From the two parties forsooth.
2321  *<S {Fal}.> The Diuell take one partie, and his Dam the
2322  *other: and so they shall be both bestowed; I haue suf-fer'd
2323  *more for their sakes; more then the villanous in-constancy
2324   of mans disposition is able to beare.
2325  *<S {Qui}.> And haue not they suffer'd? Yes, I warrant; spe-ciously
2326  *one of them; Mistris {Ford} (good heart) is beaten
2327  *blacke and blew, that you cannot see a white spot about
2328   her.
2329  *<S {Fal}.> What tell'st thou mee of blacke, and blew? I
2330  *was beaten my selfe into all the colours of the Raine-bow:
2331  *and I was like to be apprehended for the Witch
2332  *of {Braineford}, but that my admirable dexteritie of wit,
2333  *my counterfeiting the action of an old woman deliuer'd
2334  *me, the knaue Constable had set me ith' Stocks, ith' com-mon
2335   Stocks, for a Witch.
2336  *<S {Qu,}> Sir: let me speake with you in your Chamber,
2337  *you shall heare how things goe, and (I warrant) to your
2338  *content: here is a Letter will say somewhat: (good- hearts)
2339  *what a-doe here is to bring you together? Sure,
2340  *one of you do's not serue heauen well, that you are so
2341   cross'd.
2342   <S {Fal}.> Come vp into my Chamber.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2343   <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
2344   <D {Enter Fenton, Host}.>
2345  *<S {Host}.> Master {Fenton}, talke not to mee, my minde is
2346   heauy: I will giue ouer all.
2347   <S {Fen}.> Yet heare me speake: assist me in my purpose,
2348   And (as I am a gentleman) ile giue thee
2349   A hundred pound in gold, more then your losse.
2350  *<S {Host}.> I will heare you (Master {Fenton}) and I will (at
2351   the least) keepe your counsell.
2352   <S {Fen}.> From time to time, I haue acquainted you
2353   With the deare loue I beare to faire {Anne Page},
2354   Who, mutually, hath answer'd my affection,
2355   (So farre forth, as her selfe might be her chooser)
2356   Euen to my wish; I haue a letter from her
2357   Of such contents, as you will wonder at;
2358   The mirth whereof, so larded with my matter,
2359   That neither (singly) can be manifested
2360   Without the shew of both: fat {Falstaffe}
2361   Hath a great Scene; the image of the iest
2362   Ile show you here at large (harke good mine {Host}:)
2363   To night at {Hernes- Oke}, iust 'twixt twelue and one,
2364   Must my sweet {Nan} present the {Faerie- Queene}:
2365   The purpose why, is here: in which disguise
2366   While other Iests are something ranke on foote,
2367   Her father hath commanded her to slip
2368   Away with {Slender}, and with him, at {Eaton}
2369   Immediately to Marry: She hath consented: Now Sir,
2370   Her Mother, (euen strong against that match
2371   And firme for Doctor {Caius}) hath appointed
2372   That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
2373   While other sports are tasking of their mindes,
2374   And at the {Deanry}, where a {Priest} attends
2375   Strait marry her: to this her Mothers plot
2376   She seemingly obedient) likewise hath
2377   Made promise to the {Doctor}: Now, thus it rests,
2378   Her Father meanes she shall be all in white;
2379   And in that habit, when {Slender} sees his time
2380   To take her by the hand, and bid her goe,
2381   She shall goe with him: her Mother hath intended
2382   (The better to deuote her to the {Doctor};
2383   For they must all be mask'd, and vizarded)
      <P E5v><C B>
2384   That quaint in greene, she shall be loose en- roab'd,
2385   With Ribonds- pendant, flaring 'bout her head;
2386   And when the Doctor spies his vantage ripe,
2387   To pinch her by the hand, and on that token,
2388   The maid hath giuen consent to go with him.
2389  *<S {Host}.> Which meanes she to deceiue? Father, or Mo-ther.
2390  _
2391   <S {Fen}.> Both (my good Host) to go along with me:
2392   And heere it rests, that you'l procure the Vicar
2393   To stay for me at Church, 'twixt twelue, and one,
2394   And in the lawfull name of marrying,
2395   To giue our hearts vnited ceremony.
2396   <S {Host}.> Well, husband your deuice; Ile to the Vicar,
2397   Bring you the Maid, you shall not lacke a Priest.

2399   Besides, Ile make a present recompence.  <D {Exeunt}>

2404  *Away, go, they say there is Diuinity in odde Numbers,

2406  *<S {Qui}.> Ile prouide you a chaine, and Ile do what I can
2407   to get you a paire of hornes.
2408  *<S {Fall}.> Away I say, time weares, hold vp your head &
2409  *mince. How now M[aster]. {Broome}? Master {Broome}, the mat-ter
2410  *will be knowne to night, or neuer. Bee you in the
2411  *Parke about midnight, at Hernes- Oake, and you shall
2412   see wonders.
2413  *<S {Ford}.> Went you not to her yesterday (Sir) as you told
2414   me you had appointed?
2415  *<S {Fal}.> I went to her (Master {Broome}) as you see, like a
2416  *poore- old- man, but I came from her (Master {Broome})
2417  *like a poore- old- woman; that same knaue ({Ford} hir hus-band)
2418  *hath the finest mad diuell of iealousie in him (Ma-ster
2419  *{Broome}) that euer gouern'd Frensie. I will tell you,

2421  *the shape of Man (Master {Broome}) I feare not Goliath
2422  *with a Weauers beame, because I know also, life is a
2423  *Shuttle) I am in #hast, go along with mee, Ile tell you all
2424  *(Master {Broome}:) since I pluckt Geese, plaide Trewant,
2425  *and whipt Top, I knew not what 'twas to be beaten, till

2427  *knaue {Ford}, on whom to night I will be reuenged, and I
2428  *will deliuer his wife into your hand. Follow, straunge

2432  *<S {Page}.> Come, come: wee'll couch i'th Castle- ditch,
2433  *till we see the light of our Fairies. Remember son {Slen-der},
2434   my
2435  *<S {Slen}.> #I forsooth, I haue spoke with her, & we haue
2436  *a nay- word, how to know one another. I come to her
2437  *in white, and cry Mum; she cries Budget, and by that
2438   we know one another.
2439  *<S {Shal}.> That's good too: But what needes either your
2440  *Mum, or her Budget? The white will decipher her well
2441   enough. It hath strooke ten #a' clocke.
2442  *<S {Page}.> The night is darke, Light and Spirits will be-come
2443  *it wel: Heauen prosper our sport. No man means
2444  *euill but the deuill, and we shal know him by his hornes.
2445   Lets away: follow me.  <D {Exeunt}.>

2447   <D {Enter Mist.#Page, Mist.#Ford, Caius}.>
2448  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Mr Doctor, my daughter is in green, when
2449  *you see your time, take her by the hand, away with her
2450  *to the Deanerie, and dispatch it quickly: go before into
2451   the Parke: we two must go together.
2452   <S {Cai}.> I know vat  I haue to do, adieu.
2453  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Fare you well (Sir:) my husband will not
2454  *reioyce so much at the abuse of {Falstaffe}, as he will chafe
2455  *at the Doctors marrying my daughter: But 'tis no mat-ter;
2456  *better a little chiding, then a great deale of heart-breake.
2457  _
2458  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> Where is {Nan} now? and her troop of Fai-ries?
2459   and the Welch- deuill Herne?
2460  *<S {Mist.Page}.> They are all couch'd in a pit hard by Hernes
2461  *Oake, with obscur'd Lights; which at the very instant
2462  *of {Falstaffes} and our meeting, they will at once display to
2463   the night.
2464   <S {Mist.Ford}.> That cannot choose but amaze him.
2465  *<S {Mist.Page}.> If he be not amaz'd he will be mock'd: If
2466   he be amaz'd, he will euery way be mock'd.
2467   <S {Mist.Ford}.> Wee'll betray him finely.
2468  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Against such Lewdsters, and their lechery,
2469   Those that betray them, do no treachery.
2470  *<S {Mist.Ford}.> The houre drawes- on: to the Oake, to the
2471   Oake.  <D {Exeunt}.>

2482  *<S {Fal}.> The Windsor- bell hath stroke twelue: the Mi-nute
2483  *drawes- on: Now the hot- bloodied- Gods assist me:
2484  *Remember Ioue, thou was't a Bull for thy {Europa}, Loue
2485  *set on thy hornes. O powerfull Loue, that in some re-spects
2486  *makes a Beast a Man: in som other, a Man a beast.
2487  *You were also (Iupiter) a Swan, for the loue of {Leda}: O
      <P E6>
2488  *omnipotent Loue, how nere the God drew to the com-plexion
2489  *of a Goose: a fault done first in the forme of a
2490  *beast, (O Ioue, a beastly fault:) and then another fault,
2491  *in the semblance of a Fowle, thinke on't (Ioue) a fowle- fault.
2492  *When Gods haue hot backes, what shall poore
2493  *men do? For me, I am heere a Windsor Stagge, and the
2494  *fattest (I thinke) i'th Forrest. Send me a coole rut- time
2495  *(Ioue) or who can blame me to pisse my Tallow? Who
2496   comes heere? my #Doe?
2497   <S {M.Ford}.> Sir {Iohn}? Art thou there (my Deere?)
2498   My male- Deere?
2499  *<S {Fal}.> My #Doe, with the blacke Scut? Let the skie
2500  *raine Potatoes: let it thunder, to the tune of Greene-sleeues,
2501  *haile- kissing Comfits, and snow Eringoes: Let
2502  *there come a tempest of prouocation, I will shelter mee
2503   heere.
2504  *<S {M.Ford}.> Mistris {Page} is come with me (sweet hart.)
2505  *<S {Fal}.> Diuide me like a brib'd- Bucke, each a Haunch:
2506  *I will keepe my sides to my selfe, my shoulders for the
2507  *fellow of this walke; and my hornes I bequeath your
2508  *husbands. Am I a Woodman, ha? Speake I like {Herne}
2509  *the Hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience,
2510   he makes restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome.
2511   <S {M.Page}.> Alas, what noise?
2512   <S {M.Ford}.> Heauen forgiue our sinnes.
2513   <S {Fal}.> What should this be?
2514   <S {M.Ford}. {M.Page}.> Away, away.
2515   <S {Fal}.> I thinke the diuell wil not haue me damn'd,
2516   Least the oyle that's in me should set #hell on fire;
2517   He would neuer else crosse me thus.
2518   <D {Enter Fairies}.>
2519   <S {Qui}.> Fairies blacke, gray, greene, and white,
2520   You Moone- shine reuellers, and shades of night.
2521   You Orphan heires of fixed destiny,
2522   Attend your office, and your quality.
2523   Crier Hob- goblyn, make the Fairy Oyes.
2524  *<S {Pist}.> Elues, list your names: Silence you aiery toyes.
2525   Cricket, to Windsor- chimnies shalt thou leape;
2526   Where fires thou find'st vnrak'd, and hearths vnswept,
2527   There pinch the Maids as blew as Bill- berry,
2528   Our radiant Queene, hates Sluts, and Sluttery.
2529  *<S {Fal}.> They are Fairies, he that speaks to them shall die,
2530   Ile winke, and couch: No man their workes must eie.
2531  *<S {Eu}.> Wher's {Bede}? Go you, and where you find a maid
2532   That ere she sleepe has thrice her prayers said,
2533   Raise vp the Organs of her fantasie,
2534   Sleepe she as sound as carelesse infancie,
2535   But those as sleepe, and thinke not on their sins,
2536  *Pinch them armes, legs, backes, shoulders, sides, & shins.
2537   <S {Qu}.> About, about:
2538   Search Windsor Castle (Elues) within, and out.
2539   Strew good lucke (Ouphes) on euery sacred roome,
2540   That it may stand till the perpetuall doome,
2541   In state as wholsome, as in state 'tis fit,
2542   Worthy the Owner, and the Owner it.
2543   The seuerall Chaires of Order, looke you scowre
2544   With iuyce of Balme; and euery precious flowre,
2545   Each faire Instalment, Coate, and seu'rall Crest,
2546   With loyall Blazon, euermore be blest.
2547   And Nightly- meadow- Fairies, looke you sing
2548   Like to the {Garters}- Compasse, in a ring
2549   Th' expressure  that it beares: Greene let it be,
2550   More fertile- fresh then all the Field to see:
2551   And, {Hony Soit Qui Mal-y- Pence}, write
2552   In Emrold- tuffes, Flowres purple, blew, and white,
2553   Like Saphire- pearle, and rich embroiderie,
2554   Buckled below faire Knight- hoods bending knee;
2555   Fairies vse Flowres for their characterie.
2556   Away, disperse: But till 'tis one #a clocke,
2557   Our Dance of Custome, round about the Oke
2558   Of {Herne} the Hunter, let vs not forget.
2559  *<S {Euan}.> Pray you lock hand in hand: your selues in order |(set:
2560   And twenty glow- wormes shall our Lanthornes bee
2561   To guide our Measure round about the Tree.
2562   But stay, I smell a man of middle earth.
2563   <S {Fal}.> Heauens defend me from that Welsh Fairy,
2564   Least he transforme me to a peece of Cheese.
2565  *<S {Pist}.> Vilde worme, thou wast ore- look'd euen in thy
2566   birth.
2567   <S {Qu}.> With Triall- fire touch me his finger end:
2568   If he be chaste, the flame will backe descend
2569   And turne him to no paine: but if he start,
2570   It is the flesh of a corrupted hart.
2571   <S {Pist}.> A triall, come.
2572   <S {Eua}.> Come: will this wood take fire?
2573   <S {Fal}.> Oh, oh, oh.
2574   <S {Qui}.> Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire.
2575   About him (Fairies) sing a scornfull rime,
2576   And as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
2577   <D The Song.>
2578   {Fie on sinnefull phantasie: Fie on Lust, and Luxurie:}
2579   {Lust is but a bloudy fire, kindled with vnchaste desire},
2580   {Fed in heart whose flames aspire},
2581   {As thoughts do blow them higher and higher}.
2582   {Pinch him (Fairies) mutually: Pinch him for his villanie}.
2583   {Pinch him, and burne him, and turne him about},
2584   {Till Candles, & Star- light, & Moone- shine be out}.
2585  *<S {Page}.> Nay do not flye, I thinke we haue watcht you
2586  *now: Will none but {Herne} the Hunter serue your
2587   turne?
2588  *<S {M.Page}.> I pray you come, hold vp the iest no higher.
2589   Now (good Sir {Iohn}) how like you {Windsor} wiues?
2590   See you these husband? Do not these faire yoakes
2591   Become the Forrest better then the Towne?
2592   <S {Ford}.> Now Sir, whose a Cuckold now?
2593   Mr {Broome}, {Falstaffe}s a Knaue, a Cuckoldly knaue,
2594   Heere are his hornes Master {Broome}:
2595  *And Master {Broome}, he hath enioyed nothing of {Fords},
2596  *but his Buck- basket, his cudgell, and twenty pounds of
2597  *money, which must be paid to Mr {Broome}, his horses are
2598   arrested for it, Mr {Broome}.
2599  *<S {M.Ford}.> Sir {Iohn}, we haue had #ill lucke: wee could
2600  *neuer meete: I will neuer take you for my Loue againe,
2601   but I will alwayes count you my Deere.
2602   <S {Fal}.> I do begin to perceiue that I am made an Asse.
2603  *<S {Ford}.> #I, and an Oxe too: both the proofes are ex-tant.
2604  _
2605   <S {Fal}.> And these are not Fairies:
2606  *I was three or foure times in the thought they were not
2607  *Fairies, and yet the guiltinesse of my minde, the sodaine
2608  *surprize of my powers, droue the grossenesse of the fop-pery
2609  *into a receiu'd beleefe, in despight of the teeth of
2610  *all rime and reason, that they were Fairies. See now
2611  *how wit may be made a Iacke- a- Lent, when 'tis vpon #ill
2612   imployment.
2613  *<S {Euans}.> Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}, serue Got, and leaue your
2614   desires, and Fairies will not pinse you.
2615   <S {Ford}.> Well said Fairy {Hugh}.
2616  *<S {Euans}.> And leaue you your iealouzies too, I pray
2617   you.
      <P E6v>
2618  *<S {Ford}.> I will neuer mistrust my wife againe, till thou
2619   art able to woo her in good English.
2620  *<S {Fal}.> Haue I laid my braine in the Sun, and dri'de it,
2621  *that it wants matter to preuent so grosse ore- reaching as
2622  *this? Am I ridden with a Welch Goate too? Shal I haue
2623  *a Coxcombe of Frize? Tis time I were choak'd with a
2624   peece of toasted Cheese.
2625  *<S {Eu}.> Seese is not good to giue putter; your belly is al
2626   putter.
2627  *<S {Fal}.> Seese, and Putter? Haue I liu'd to stand at the
2628  *taunt of one that makes Fritters of English? This is e-nough
2629  *to be the decay of lust and late- walking through
2630   the Realme.
2631  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Why Sir {Iohn}, do you thinke though wee
2632  *would haue thrust vertue out of our hearts by the head
2633  *and shoulders, and haue giuen our selues without scru-ple
2634  *to #hell, that euer the deuill could haue made you our
2635   delight?
2636   <S {Ford}.> What, a hodge- pudding? A bag of flax?
2637   <S {Mist.Page}.> A puft man?
2638  *<S {Page}.> Old, cold, wither'd, and of intollerable en-trailes?
2639  _
2640   <S {Ford}.> And one that is as slanderous as Sathan?
2641   <S {Page}.> And as poore as Iob?
2642   <S {Ford}.> And as wicked as his wife?
2643  *<S {Euan}.> And giuen to Fornications, and to Tauernes,
2644  *and Sacke, and Wine, and Metheglins, and to drinkings
2645   and swearings, and starings? Pribles and prables?
2646  *<S {Fal}.> Well, I am your Theame: you haue the start of
2647  *me, I am deiected: I am not able to answer the Welch
2648  *Flannell, Ignorance it selfe is a plummet ore me, vse me
2649   as you will.
2650  *<S {Ford}.> Marry Sir, wee'l bring you to Windsor to one
2651  *Mr {Broome}, that you haue cozon'd of money, to whom
2652  *you should haue bin a Pander: ouer and aboue that you
2653  *haue suffer'd, I thinke, to repay that money will be a bi-ting
2654   affliction.
2655  *<S {Page}.> Yet be cheerefull Knight: thou shalt eat a pos-set
2656  *to night at my house, wher I will desire thee to laugh
2657  *at my wife, that now laughes at thee: Tell her Mr {Slen-der}
2658   hath married her daughter.
2659   <S {Mist.Page}.> Doctors doubt that;
2660  *If {Anne Page} be my daughter, she is (by this) Doctour
2661   {#Caius} wife.
2662   <S {Slen}.> Whoa  hoe, hoe, Father {Page}.
2663   <S {Page}.> Sonne? How now? How now Sonne,
2664   Haue you dispatch'd?
2665  *<S {Slen}.> Dispatch'd? Ile make the best in Glostershire
2666   know on't: would I were hang'd la, else.
2667   <S {Page}.> Of what sonne?
2668  *<S {Slen}.> I came yonder at {Eaton} to marry Mistris {Anne}
2669  *{#Page}, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not bene
2670  *i'th Church, I would haue swing'd him, or hee should
2671  *haue swing'd me. If I did not thinke it had beene {Anne}
2672  *{#Page}, would I might neuer stirre, and 'tis a Post- masters
2673   Boy.
2674   <S {Page}.> Vpon my life then, you tooke the wrong.
2675  *<S {Slen}.> What neede you tell me that? I think so, when
2676  *I tooke a Boy for a Girle: If I had bene married to him,
2677  *(for all he was in womans apparrell) I would not haue
2678   had him.
2679   <S {Page}.> Why this is your owne folly,
2680  *Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter,
2681   By her garments?
2682  *<S {Slen}.> I went to her in greene, and cried Mum, and
2683  *she cride budget, as {Anne} and I had appointed, and yet
2684   it was not {Anne}, but a Post- masters boy.
2685  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Good {George} be not angry, I knew of
2686  *your purpose: turn'd my daughter into white, and in-deede
2687  *she is now with the Doctor at the Deanrie, and
2688   there married.
2689  *<S {Cai}.> Ver is Mistris {Page}: by gar I am cozoned, I #ha
2690  *married oon Garsoon, a boy; oon pesant, by gar. A boy,
2691   it is not {#An Page}, by  gar, I am cozened.
2692   <S {M.Page}.> Why? did you take her in white?
2693  *<S {Cai}.> #I #bee gar, and 'tis a boy: #be gar, Ile raise all
2694   Windsor.
2695  *<S {Ford}.> This is strange: Who hath got the right {Anne}?
2696   <S {Page}.> My heart misgiues me, here comes Mr {Fenton}.
2697   How now Mr {Fenton}?
2698  *<S {Anne}.> Pardon good father, good my mother pardon
2699   <S {Page}.> Now Mistris:
2700   How chance you went not with Mr {Slender}?
2701  *<S {M.Page}.> Why went you not with Mr Doctor, maid?
2702   <S {Fen}.> You do amaze her: heare the truth of it,
2703   You would haue married her most shamefully,
2704   Where there was no proportion held in loue:
2705   The truth is, she and I (long since contracted)
2706   Are now so sure that nothing can dissolue vs:
2707   Th' offence  is holy, that she hath committed,
2708   And this deceit looses the name of craft,
2709   Of disobedience, or vnduteous title,
2710   Since therein she doth euitate and shun
2711   A thousand irreligious cursed houres
2712  *Which forced marriage would haue brought vpon her.
2713   <S {Ford}.> Stand not amaz'd, here is no remedie:
2714   In Loue, the heauens themselues do guide the state,
2715   Money buyes Lands, and wiues are sold by fate.
2716  *<S {Fal}.> I am glad, though you haue tane a special stand
2717   to strike at me, that your Arrow hath glanc'd.
2718  *<S {Page}.> Well, what remedy? {Fenton}, heauen giue thee
2719   ioy, what cannot be eschew'd, must be embrac'd.
2720  *<S {Fal}.> When night- dogges run, all sorts of Deere are
2721   chac'd.
2722  *<S {Mist.Page}.> Well, I will muse no further: Mr {Fenton},
2723   Heauen giue you many, many merry dayes:
2724   Good husband, let vs euery one go home,
2725   And laugh this sport ore by a Countrie fire,
2726   Sir {Iohn} and all.
2727   <S {Ford}.> Let it be so (Sir {Iohn}:)
2728   To Master {Broome}, you yet shall hold your word,
2729   For he, to night, shall lye with Mistris {Ford}:  <D {Exeunt}>
2730   <Z FINIS.
