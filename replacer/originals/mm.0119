2      <D {Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords}.>
3      <S {Duke}.>
4      {Escalus}.
5      <S {Esc}.> My Lord.
6     *<S {Duk}.> Of Gouernment, the properties to vn-|(fold,
7     *Would seeme in me t' affect speech & discourse,
8      Since I am put to know, that your owne Science
9      Exceedes (in that) the lists of all aduice
10     My strength can giue you: Then no more remaines
11     But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
12     And let them worke: The nature of our People,
13     Our {Cities Institutions}, and the Termes
14     For Common Iustice, y'are as pregnant in
15     As #Art, and practise, hath inriched any
16     That we remember: There is our Commission,
17    *From which, we would not haue you warpe; call hither,
18     I say, bid come before vs {Angelo}:
19     What figure of vs thinke you, he will beare.
20     For you must know, we haue with speciall soule
21     Elected him our absence to supply;
22     Lent him our terror, drest him with our loue,
23     And giuen his Deputation all the Organs
24     Of our owne powre: What thinke you of it?
25     <S {Esc}.> If any in {Vienna} be of worth
26     To vndergoe such ample grace, and honour,
27     It is Lord {Angelo}.
28     <D {Enter Angelo}.>
29     <S {Duk}.> Looke where he comes.
30     <S {Ang}.> Alwayes obedient to your Graces #will,
31     I come to know your pleasure.
32     <S {Duke}.> {Angelo}:
33     There is a kinde of Character in thy life,
34     That to th' obseruer, doth thy history
35     Fully vnfold: Thy selfe, and thy belongings
36     Are not thine owne so proper, as to waste
37     Thy selfe vpon thy vertues; they on thee:
38     Heauen doth with vs, as we, with Torches doe,
39     Not light them for themselues: For if our vertues
40     Did not goe forth of vs, 'twere all alike
41     As if we had them not: Spirits are not finely touch'd,
42     But to fine issues: nor nature neuer lends
43     The smallest scruple of her excellence,
44     But like a thrifty goddesse, she determines
45     Her selfe the glory of a creditour,
46     Both thanks, and vse; but I do bend my speech
      <C D>
47     To one that can my part in him aduertise;
48     Hold therefore {Angelo}:
49     In our remoue, be thou at full, our selfe:
50     Mortallitie and Mercie in {Vienna}
51     Liue in thy tongue, and heart: Old {Escalus}
52     Though first in question, is thy secondary.
53     Take thy Commission.
54     <S {Ang}.> Now good my Lord
55     Let there be some more test, made of my mettle,
56     Before so noble, and so great a figure
57     Be stamp't vpon it.
58     <S {Duk}.> No more euasion:
59     We haue with a leauen'd, and prepared choice
60     Proceeded to you; therefore take your honors:
61     Our haste from hence is of so quicke condition,
62     That it prefers it selfe, and leaues vnquestion'd
63     Matters of needfull value: We shall write to you
64     As time, and our concernings shall importune,
65     How it goes with vs, and doe looke to know
66     What doth befall you here. So fare you well:
67     To th' hopefull execution doe I leaue you,
68     Of your Commissions.
69     <S {Ang}.> Yet giue leaue (my Lord,)
70     That we may bring you something on the way.
71     <S {Duk}.> My haste may not admit it,
72     Nor neede you (on mine honor) haue to doe
73     With any scruple: your scope is as mine owne,
74     So to inforce, or qualifie the Lawes
75     As to your soule seemes good: Giue me your hand,
76     Ile priuily away: I loue the people,
77     But doe not like to stage me to their eyes:
78     Though it doe well, I doe not rellish well
79     Their lowd applause, and Aues vehement:
80     Nor doe I thinke the man of safe discretion
81     That do's affect it. Once more fare you well.
82     <S {Ang}.> The heauens giue safety to your purposes.
83    *<S {Esc}.> Lead forth, and bring you backe in happi-nesse.
84     <D {Exit}.>
85     <S {Duk}.> I thanke you, fare you well.
86     <S {Esc}.> I shall desire you, Sir, to giue me leaue
87     To haue free speech with you; and it concernes me
88     To looke into the bottome of my place:
89     A powre I haue, but of what strength and nature,
90     I am not yet instructed.
91     <S {Ang}.> 'Tis so with me: Let vs with-draw together,
92     And we may soone our satisfaction haue
93     Touching that point.
94     <S {Esc}.> Ile wait vpon your honor.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P F1v>
95     <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
96     <D {Enter Lucio, and two other Gentlemen}.>
97    *<S {Luc}.> If the {Duke}, with the other Dukes, come not to
98    *composition with the King of {Hungary}, why then all the
99     Dukes fall vpon the King.
100   *<S 1.{Gent}.> Heauen grant vs its peace, but not the King
101    of {Hungaries}.
102    <S 2.{Gent}.> Amen.
103   *<S {Luc}.> Thou conclud'st like the Sanctimonious Pirat,
104   *that went to sea with the ten Commandements, but
105    scrap'd one out of the Table.
106    <S 2.{Gent}.> Thou shalt not Steale?
107    <S {Luc}.> #I, that he raz'd.
108   *<S 1.{Gent}.> Why? 'twas a commandement, to command
109   *the Captaine and all the rest from their functions: they
110   *put forth to steale: There's not a Souldier of vs all, that
111   *in the thanks- giuing before meate, do rallish the petition
112    well, that praies for peace.
113    <S 2.{Gent}.> I neuer heard any Souldier dislike it.
114   *<S {Luc}.> I beleeue thee: for I thinke thou neuer was't
115    where Grace was said.
116    <S 2.{Gent}.> No? a dozen times at least.
117    <S 1.{Gent}.> What? In meeter?
118    <S {Luc}.> In any proportion: or in any language.
119    <S 1.{Gent}.> I thinke, or in any Religion.
120   *<S {Luc}.> #I, why not? Grace, is Grace, despight of all con-trouersie:
121   *as for example; Thou thy selfe art a wicked
122    villaine, despight of all Grace.
123   *<S 1.{Gent}.> Well: there went but a paire of sheeres be-tweene
124    vs.
125   *<S {Luc}.> I grant: as there may betweene the Lists, and
126    the Veluet. Thou art the List.
127   *<S 1.{Gent}.> And thou the Veluet; thou art good veluet;
128   *thou'rt a three pild- peece I warrant thee: I had as liefe
129   *be a Lyst of an English Kersey, as be pil'd, as thou art
130    pil'd, for a French Veluet. Do I speake feelingly now?
131   *<S {Luc}.> I thinke thou do'st: and indeed with most pain-full
132   *feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine owne con-fession,
133   *learne to begin thy health; but, whilst I liue for-get
134    to drinke after thee.
135   *<S 1.{Gen}.> I think I haue done my selfe wrong, haue I not?
136   *<S 2.{Gent}.> Yes, that thou hast; whether thou art tainted,
137    or free.  <D {Enter Bawde}.>
138   *<S {Luc}.> Behold, behold, where Madam {Mitigation} comes.
139    I haue purchas'd as many diseases vnder her Roofe,
140    As come to
141    <S 2.{Gent}.> To what, I pray?
142    <S {Luc}.> Iudge.
143    <S 2.{Gent}.> To three thousand Dollours a yeare.
144    <S 1.{Gent}.> #I, and more.
145    <S {Luc}.> A French crowne more.
146   *<S 1.{Gent}.> Thou art alwayes figuring diseases in me; but
147    thou art full of error, I am sound.
148   *<S {Luc}.> Nay, not (as one would say) healthy: but so
149   *sound, as things that are hollow; thy bones are hollow;
150    Impiety has made a feast of thee.
151   *<S 1.{Gent}.> How now, which of your hips has the most
152    profound Ciatica?
153   *<S {Bawd}.> Well, well: there's one yonder arrested, and
154    carried to prison, was worth fiue thousand of you all.
155    <S 2.{Gent}.> Who's that I pray'thee?
156    <S {Bawd}.> Marry Sir, that's {Claudio}, Signior {Claudio}.
      <C C>
157    <S 1.{Gent}.> {Claudio} to prison? 'tis not so.
158   *<S {Bawd}.> Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested:
159   *saw him carried away: and which is more, within these
160    three daies his head to be chop'd off.
161   *<S {Luc}.> But, after all this fooling, I would not haue it so:
162    Art thou sure of this?
163   *<S {Bawd}.> I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
164    {Iulietta} with childe.
165   *<S {Luc}.> Beleeue me this may be: he promis'd to meete
166   *me two howres since, and he was euer precise in promise
167    keeping.
168   *<S 2.{Gent}.> Besides you know, it drawes somthing neere
169    to the speech we had to such a purpose.
170   *<S 1.{Gent}.> But most of all agreeing with the proclamatio[n].
171    <S {Luc}.> Away: let's goe learne the truth of it.  <D {Exit}.>
172   *<S {Bawd}.> Thus, what with the war; what with the sweat,
173   *what with the gallowes, and what with pouerty, I am
174   *Custom- shrunke.  How now? what's the newes with
175    you.  <D {Enter Clowne}.>
176    <S {Clo}.> Yonder man is carried to prison.
177    <S {Baw}.> Well: what has he done?
178    <S {Clo}.> A Woman.
179    <S {Baw}.> But what's his offence?
180    <S {Clo}.> Groping for Trowts, in a peculiar Riuer.
181    <S {Baw}.> What? is there a maid with child by him?
182   *<S {Clo}.> No: but there's a woman with maid by him:
183    you haue not heard of the proclamation, haue you?
184    <S {Baw}.> What proclamation, man?
185   *<S {Clow}.> All howses in the Suburbs of {Vienna} must bee
186    pluck'd downe.
187   *<S {Bawd}.> And what shall become of those in the Citie?
188   *<S {Clow}.> They shall stand for seed: they had gon down
189    #to, but that a wise Burger put in for them.
190   *<S {Bawd}.> But shall all our houses of resort in the Sub-urbs
191    be puld downe?
192    <S {Clow}.> To the ground, Mistris.
193   *<S {Bawd}.> Why heere's a change indeed in the Common-wealth:
194    what shall become of me?
195   *<S {Clow}.> Come: feare not you; good Counsellors lacke
196   *no Clients: though you change your place, you neede
197   *not change your Trade: Ile bee your Tapster still; cou-rage,
198   *there will bee pitty taken on you; you that haue
199   *worne your eyes almost out in the seruice, you will bee
200    considered.
201   *<S {Bawd}.> What's to doe heere, {Thomas} Tapster? let's
202    withdraw?
203   *<S {Clo}.> Here comes Signior {Claudio}, led by the Prouost
204    to prison: and there's Madam {Iuliet}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
205    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
206    <D {Enter Prouost, Claudio, Iuliet, Officers, Lucio, &} 2.{Gent}.>
207   *<S {Cla}.> Fellow, why do'st thou show me thus to th' world?
208    Beare me to prison, where I am committed.
209    <S {Pro}.> I do it not in euill disposition,
210    But from Lord {Angelo} by speciall charge.
211    <S {Clau}.> Thus can the demy- god (Authority)
212    Make vs pay downe, for our offence, by waight
213    The words of heauen; on whom it will, it will,
214    On whom it will not (soe) yet still 'tis iust.
215   *<S {Luc}.> Why how now {Claudio}? whence comes this re-|(straint.
216    <S {Cla}.> From too much liberty, (my {Lucio}) Liberty
217    As surfet is the father of much fast,
218    So euery Scope by the immoderate vse
219    Turnes to restraint: Our Natures doe pursue
      <P F2>
220    Like Rats that rauyn downe their proper Bane,
221    A thirsty euill, and when we drinke, we die.
222   *<S {Luc}.> If I could speake so wisely vnder an arrest, I
223   *would send for certaine of my Creditors: and yet, to say
224   *the truth, I had as lief haue the foppery of freedome, as
225   *the mortality of imprisonment: what's thy offence,
226    {Claudio}?
227    <S {Cla}.> What (but to speake of) would offend againe.
228    <S {Luc}.> What, is't murder?
229    <S {Cla}.> No.
230    <S {Luc}.> Lecherie?
231    <S {Cla}.> Call it so.
232    <S {Pro}.> Away, Sir, you must goe.
233    <S {Cla}.> One word, good friend:
234    {Lucio}, a word with you.
235    <S {Luc}.> A hundred:
236   *If they'll doe you any good: Is {Lechery} so look'd after?
237    <S {Cla}.> Thus stands it with me: vpon a true contract
238    I got possession of {Iulietas} bed,
239    You know the Lady, she is fast my wife,
240    Saue that we doe the denunciation lacke
241    Of outward Order. This we came not to,
242    Onely for propogation of a Dowre
243    Remaining in the Coffer of her friends,
244    From whom we thought it meet to hide our Loue
245    Till Time had made them for vs. But it chances
246    The stealth of our most mutuall entertainment
247    With Character too grosse, is writ on {Iuliet}.
248    <S {Luc}.> With childe, perhaps?
249    <S {Cla}.> Vnhappely, euen so.
250    And the new Deputie, now for the Duke,
251    Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newnes,
252    Or whether that the body publique, be
253    A horse whereon the Gouernor doth ride,
254    Who newly in the Seate, that it may know
255    He can command; lets it strait feele the spur:
256    Whether the Tirranny be in his place,
257    Or in his Eminence that fills it vp
258    I stagger in: But this new Gouernor
259    Awakes me all the inrolled penalties
260    Which haue (like vn- scowr'd Armor) hung by th' wall
261    So long, that ninteene Zodiacks haue gone round,
262    And none of them beene worne; and for a name
263    Now puts the drowsie and neglected Act
264    Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
265   *<S {Luc}.> I warrant it is: And thy head stands so tickle on
266   *thy shoulders, that a milke- maid, if she be in loue, may
267    sigh it off: Send after the Duke, and appeale to him.
268    <S {Cla}.> I haue done so, but hee's not to be found.
269    I pre'thee ({Lucio}) doe me this kinde seruice:
270    This day, my sister should the Cloyster enter,
271    And there receiue her approbation.
272    Acquaint her with the danger of my state,
273    Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
274    To the strict deputie: bid her selfe assay him,
275    I haue great hope in that: for in her youth
276    There is a prone and speechlesse dialect,
277    Such as moue men: beside, she hath prosperous #Art
278    When she will play with reason, and discourse,
279    And well she can perswade.
280   *<S {Luc}.> I pray shee may; aswell for the encouragement
281   *of the like, which else would stand vnder greeuous im-position:
282   *as for the enioying of thy life, who I would be
283   *sorry should bee thus foolishly lost, at a game of ticke-tacke:
284    Ile to her.
285    <S {Cla}.> I thanke you good friend {Lucio}.
      <C D>
286    <S {Luc}.> Within two houres.
287    <S {Cla}.> Come Officer, away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
288    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
289    <D {Enter Duke and Frier Thomas}.>
290    <S {Duk}.> No: holy Father, throw away that thought,
291    Beleeue not that the dribling dart of Loue
292    Can pierce a compleat bosome: why, I desire thee
293    To giue me secret harbour, hath a purpose
294    More graue, and wrinkled, then the aimes, and ends
295    Of burning youth.
296    <S {Fri}.> May your Grace speake of it?
297    <S {Duk}.> My holy Sir, none better knowes then you
298    How I haue euer lou'd the life remoued
299    And held in idle price, to haunt assemblies
300    Where youth, and cost, witlesse brauery keepes.
301    I haue deliuerd to Lord {Angelo}
302    (A man of stricture and firme abstinence)
303    My absolute power, and place here in {Vienna},
304    And he supposes me trauaild to {Poland},
305    (For so I haue strewd it in the common eare)
306    And so it is receiu'd: Now (pious Sir)
307    You will demand of me, why I do this.
308    <S {Fri}.> Gladly, my Lord.
309   *<S {Duk}.> We haue strict Statutes, and most biting Laws,
310    (The needfull bits and curbes to headstrong weedes,)
311    Which for this foureteene yeares, we haue let slip,
312    Euen like an ore- growne Lyon in a Caue
313    That goes not out to prey: Now, as fond Fathers,
314    Hauing bound vp the threatning twigs of birch,
315    Onely to sticke it in their childrens sight,
316    For terror, not to vse: in time the rod
317    More mock'd, then fear'd: so our Decrees,
318    Dead to infliction, to themselues are dead,
319    And libertie, plucks Iustice by the nose;
320    The Baby beates the Nurse, and quite athwart
321    Goes all decorum.
322    <S {Fri}.> It rested in your Grace
323    To vnloose this tyde- vp Iustice, when you pleas'd:
324    And it in you more dreadfull would haue seem'd
325    Then in Lord {Angelo}.
326    <S {Duk}.> I doe feare: too dreadfull:
327    Sith 'twas my fault, to giue the people scope,
328    'Twould be my tirrany to strike and gall them,
329    For what I bid them doe: For, we bid this be done
330    When euill deedes haue their permissiue passe,
331   *And not the punishment: therefore indeede (my father)
332    I haue on {Angelo} impos'd the office,
333    Who may in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
334    And yet, my nature neuer in the sight
335    To do in slander: And to behold his sway
336    I will, as 'twere a brother of your Order,
337    Visit both Prince, and People: Therefore I pre'thee
338    Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
339    How I may formally in person beare
340    Like a true {Frier}: Moe reasons for this action
341    At our more leysure, shall I render you;
342    Onely, this one: Lord {Angelo} is precise,
343    Stands at a guard with Enuie: scarce confesses
344    That his blood flowes: or that his appetite
345    Is more to bread then stone: hence shall we see
346    If power change purpose: what our Seemers be.  <D {Exit}.>
      <P F2v>
347    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
348    <D {Enter Isabell and Francisca a Nun}.>
349    <S {Isa}.> And haue you {Nuns} no farther priuiledges?
350    <S {Nun}.> Are not these large enough?
351    <S {Isa}.> Yes truely; I speake not as desiring more,
352    But rather wishing a more strict restraint
353    Vpon the Sisterhood, the Votarists of Saint {Clare}.
354    <D {Lucio within}.>
355    <S {Luc}.> Hoa? peace be in this place.
356    <S {Isa}.> Who's that which cals?
357    <S {Nun}.> It is a mans voice: gentle {Isabella}
358    Turne you the key, and know his businesse of him;
359    You may; I may not: you are yet vnsworne:
360    When you haue vowd, you must not speake with men,
361    But in the presence of the {Prioresse};
362    Then if you speake, you must not show your face;
363    Or if you show your face, you must not speake.
364    He cals againe: I pray you answere him.
365    <S {Isa}.> Peace and prosperitie: who is't that cals?
366   *<S {Luc}.> Haile Virgin, (if you be) as those cheeke- Roses
367    Proclaime you are no lesse: can you so steed me,
368    As bring me to the sight of {Isabella},
369    A Nouice of this place, and the faire Sister
370    To her vnhappie brother {Claudio}?
371    <S {Isa}.> Why her vnhappy Brother? Let me aske,
372    The rather for I now must make you know
373    I am that {Isabella}, and his Sister.
374   *<S {Luc}.> Gentle & faire: your Brother kindly greets you;
375    Not to be weary with you; he's in prison.
376    <S {Isa}.> Woe me; for what?
377   *<S {Luc}.> For that, which if my selfe might be his Iudge,
378    He should receiue his punishment, in thankes:
379    He hath got his friend with childe.
380    <S {Isa}.> Sir, make me not your storie.
381   *<S {Luc}.> 'Tis true; I would not, though 'tis my familiar sin,
382    With Maids to seeme the Lapwing, and to iest
383    Tongue, far from heart: play with all Virgins so:
384    I hold you as a thing en- skied, and sainted,
385    By your renouncement, an imortall spirit
386    And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
387    As with a Saint.
388    <S {Isa}.> You doe blaspheme the good, in mocking me.
389   *<S {Luc}.> Doe not beleeue it: fewnes, and truth; tis thus,
390    Your brother, and his louer haue embrac'd;
391    As those that feed, grow full: as blossoming Time
392    That from the seednes, the bare fallow brings
393    To teeming foyson: euen so her plenteous wombe
394    Expresseth his full Tilth, and husbandry.
395    <S {Isa}.> Some one with childe by him? my cosen {Iuliet}?
396    <S {Luc}.> Is she your cosen?
397   *<S {Isa}.> Adoptedly, as schoole- maids change their names
398    By vaine, though apt affection.
399    <S {Luc}.> She it is.
400    <S {Isa}.> Oh, let him marry her.
401    <S {Luc}.> This is the point.
402    The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
403    Bore many gentlemen (my selfe being one)
404    In hand, and hope of action: but we doe learne,
405    By those that know the very Nerues of State,
406    His giuing- out, were of an infinite distance
407    From his true meant designe: vpon his place,
408    (And with full line of his authority)
409    Gouernes Lord {Angelo}; A man, whose blood
410    Is very snow- broth: one, who neuer feeles
411    The wanton stings, and motions of the sence;
412    But doth rebate, and blunt his naturall edge
413    With profits of the minde: Studie, and fast
414    He (to giue feare to vse, and libertie,
415    Which haue, for long, run- by the hideous law,
416    As Myce, by Lyons) hath pickt out an act,
417    Vnder whose heauy sence, your brothers life
418    Fals into forfeit: he arrests him on it,
419    And followes close the rigor of the Statute
420    To make him an example: all hope is gone,
421    Vnlesse you haue the grace, by your faire praier
422    To soften {Angelo}: And that's my pith of businesse
423    'Twixt you, and your poore brother.
424    <S {Isa}.> Doth he so,
425    Seeke his life?
426    <S {Luc}.> #Has censur'd him already,
427    And as I heare, the Prouost hath a warrant
428    For's execution.
429    <S {Isa}.> Alas: what poore
430    Abilitie's in me, to doe him good.
431    <S {Luc}.> Assay the powre you haue.
432    <S {Isa}.> My power? alas, I doubt.
433    <S {Luc}.> Our doubts are traitors
434    And makes vs loose the good we oft might win,
435    By fearing to attempt: Goe to Lord {Angelo}
436    And let him learne to know, when Maidens sue
437    Men giue like gods: but when they weepe and kneele,
438    All their petitions, are as freely theirs
439    As they themselues would owe them.
440    <S {Isa}.> Ile see what I can doe.
441    <S {Luc}.> But speedily.
442    <S {Isa}.> I will about it strait;
443    No longer staying, but to giue the Mother
444    Notice of my affaire: I humbly thanke you:
445    Commend me to my brother: soone at night
446    Ile send him certaine word of my successe.
447    <S {Luc}.> I take my leaue of you.
448    <S {Isa}.> Good sir, adieu.  <D {Exeunt}.>
449    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima}.>
450    <D {Enter Angelo, Escalus, and seruants, Iustice}.>
451    <S {Ang}.> We must not make a scar- crow of the Law,
452    Setting it vp to feare the Birds of prey,
453    And let it keepe one shape, till custome make it
454    Their pearch, and not their terror.
455    <S {Esc}.> #I, but yet
456    Let vs be keene, and rather cut a little
457    Then fall, and bruise to death: alas, this gentleman
458    Whom I would saue, had a most noble father,
459    Let but your honour know
460    (Whom I beleeue to be most strait in vertue)
461    That in the working of your owne affections,
462    Had time coheard with Place, or place with wishing,
463    Or that the resolute acting of our blood
464    Could haue attaind th' effect of your owne purpose,
465    Whether you had not sometime in your life
466    Er'd in this point, which now you censure him,
467    And puld the Law vpon you.
468    <S {Ang}.> 'Tis one thing to be tempted ({Escalus})
      <P F3>
469    Another thing to fall: I not deny
470    The Iury passing on the Prisoners life
471    May in the sworne- twelue haue a thiefe, or two
472   *Guiltier then him they try; what's open made to Iustice,
473    That Iustice ceizes; What knowes the Lawes
474    That theeues do passe on theeues? 'Tis very pregnant,
475    The Iewell that we finde, we stoope, and take't,
476    Because we see it; but what we doe not see,
477    We tread vpon, and neuer thinke of it.
478    You may not so extenuate his offence,
479    For I haue had such faults; but rather tell me
480    When I, that censure him, do so offend,
481    Let mine owne Iudgement patterne out my death,
482    And nothing come in partiall. Sir, he must dye.
483    <D {Enter Prouost}.>
484    <S {Esc}.> Be it as your wisedome will.
485    <S {Ang}.> Where is the {Prouost}?
486    <S {Pro}.> Here if it like your honour.
487    <S {Ang}.> See that {Claudio}
488    Be executed by nine to morrow morning,
489    Bring him his Confessor, let him be prepar'd,
490    For that's the vtmost of his pilgrimage.
491   *<S {Esc}.> Well: heauen forgiue him; and forgiue vs all:
492    {Some rise by sinne, and some by vertue fall}:
493    Some run from brakes of Ice, and answere none,
494    And some condemned for a fault alone.
495    <D {Enter Elbow, Froth, Clowne, Officers}.>
496    <S {Elb}.> Come, bring them away: if these be good peo-ple
497   *in a Common- weale, that doe nothing but vse their
498   *abuses in common houses, I know no law: bring them
499    away.
500   *<S {Ang}.> How now Sir, what's your name? And what's
501    the matter?
502   *<S {Elb}.> If it please your honour, I am the poore Dukes
503   *Constable, and my name is {Elbow}; I doe leane vpon Iu-stice
504   *Sir, and doe bring in here before your good honor,
505    two notorious Benefactors.
506   *<S {Ang}.> Benefactors? Well: What Benefactors are they?
507    Are they not Malefactors?
508   *<S {Elb}.> If it please your honour, I know not well what
509   *they are: But precise villaines they are, that I am sure of,
510   *and void of all prophanation in the world, that good
511    Christians ought to haue.
512    <S {Esc}.> This comes off well: here's a wise Officer.
513   *<S {Ang}.> Goe to: What quality are they of? {Elbow} is
514    your name?
515    Why do'st thou not speake {Elbow}?
516    <S {Clo}.> He cannot Sir: he's out at Elbow.
517    <S {Ang}.> What are you Sir?
518   *<S {Elb}.> He Sir: a Tapster Sir: parcell Baud: one that
519   *serues a bad woman: whose house Sir was (as they say)
520   *pluckt downe in the Suborbs: and now shee professes a
521    hot- house; which, I thinke is a very #ill house too.
522    <S {Esc}.> How know you that?
523   *<S {Elb}.> My wife Sir? whom I detest before heauen, and
524    your honour.
525    <S {Esc}.> How? thy wife?
526   *<S {Elb}.> #I Sir: whom I thanke heauen is an honest wo-man.
527   _
528    <S {Esc}.> Do'st thou detest her therefore?
529   *<S {Elb}.> I say sir, I will detest my selfe also, as well as she,
530   *that this house, if it be not a Bauds house, it is pitty of her
531    life, for it is a naughty house.
532    <S {Esc}.> How do'st thou know that, Constable?
533   *<S {Elb}.> Marry sir, by my wife, who, if she had bin a wo-man
534   *Cardinally giuen, might haue bin accus'd in forni-cation,
535    adultery, and all vncleanlinesse there.
536    <S {Esc}.> By the womans meanes?
537   *<S {Elb}.> #I sir, by Mistris {Ouer-dons} meanes: but as she spit
538    in his face, so she defide him.
539    <S {Clo}.> Sir, if it please your honor, this is not so.
540   *<S {Elb}.> Proue it before these varlets here, thou honora-ble
541    man, proue it.
542    <S {Esc}.> Doe you heare how he misplaces?
543   *<S {Clo}.> Sir, she came in great with childe: and longing
544   *(sauing your honors reuerence) for stewd prewyns; sir,
545   *we had but two in the house, which at that very distant
546   *time stood, as it were in a fruit dish (a dish of some three
547   *pence; your honours haue seene such dishes) they are not
548    China- dishes, but very good dishes.
549    <S {Esc}.> Go #too: go #too: no matter for the dish sir.
550   *<S {Clo}.> No indeede sir not of a pin; you are therein in
551   *the right: but, to the point: As I say, this Mistris {Elbow},
552   *being (as I say)  with childe, and being great bellied, and
553   *longing (as I said) for prewyns: and hauing but two in
554   *the dish (as I said) Master {Froth} here, this very man, ha-uing
555   *eaten the rest (as I said) & (as I say) paying for them
556   *very honestly: for, as you know Master {Froth}, I could not
557    giue you three pence againe.
558    <S {Fro}.> No indeede.
559   *<S {Clo}.> Very well: you being then (if you be remem-bred)
560    cracking the stones of the foresaid prewyns.
561    <S {Fro}.> #I, so I did indeede.
562   *<S {Clo}.> Why,  very well: I telling you then (if you be
563   *remembred) that such a one, and such a one, were past
564   *cure of the thing you wot of, vnlesse they kept very good
565    diet, as I told you.
566    <S {Fro}.> All this is true.
567    <S {Clo}.> Why very well then.
568   *<S {Esc}.> Come: you are a tedious foole: to the purpose:
569   *what was done to {Elbowes} wife, that hee hath cause to
570    complaine of? Come me to what was done to her.
571    <S {Clo}.> Sir, your honor cannot come to that yet.
572    <S {Esc}.> No sir, nor I meane it not.
573   *<S {Clo}.> Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honours
574   *leaue: And I beseech you, looke into Master {Froth} here
575   *sir, a man of foure- score pound a yeare; whose father
576   *died at {Hallowmas}: #Was't not at {Hallowmas} Master
577    {Froth}?
578    <S {Fro}.> Allhallond- Eue.
579   *<S {Clo}.> Why very well: I hope here be truthes: he Sir,
580   *sitting (as I say) in a lower chaire, Sir, 'twas in the bunch
581   *of Grapes, where indeede you haue a delight to sit, haue
582    you not?
583   *<S {Fro}.> I haue so, because it is an open roome, and good
584    for winter.
585    <S {Clo}.> Why very well then: I hope here be truthes.
586    <S {Ang}.> This will last out a night in {Russia}
587    When nights are longest there: Ile take my leaue,
588    And leaue you to the hearing of the cause;
589    Hoping youle finde good cause to whip them all.  <D {Exit}.>
590   *<S {Esc}.> I thinke no lesse: good morrow to your Lord-ship.
591   *Now Sir, come on: What was done to {Elbowes}
592    wife, once more?
593    <S {Clo}.> Once Sir? there was nothing done to her once.
594   *<S {Elb}.> I beseech you Sir, aske him what this man did to
595    my wife.
596    <S {Clo}.> I beseech your honor, aske me.
597    <S {Esc}.> Well sir, what did this Gentleman to her?
598   *<S {Clo}.> I beseech you sir, looke in this Gentlemans face:
599   *good Master {Froth} looke vpon his honor; 'tis for a good
600    purpose: doth your honor marke his face?
      <P F3v><C C>
601    <S {Esc}.> #I sir, very well.
602    <S {Clo}.> Nay, I beseech you marke it well.
603    <S {Esc}.> Well, I doe so.
604    <S {Clo}.> Doth your honor see any harme in his face?
605    <S {Esc}.> Why no.
606   *<S {Clo}.> Ile be supposd vpon a booke, his face is the worst
607   *thing about him: good then: if his face be the worst
608   *thing about him, how could Master {Froth} doe the Con-stables
609   *wife any harme? I would know that of your
610    honour.
611   *<S {Esc}.> He's in the right (Constable) what say you to it?
612   *<S {Elb}.> First, #and it like you, the house is a respected
613   *house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his Mistris is
614    a respected woman.
615   *<S {Clo}.> By this hand Sir, his wife is a more respected per-son
616    then any of vs all.
617   *<S {Elb}.> Varlet, thou lyest; thou lyest wicked varlet: the
618   *time is yet to come that shee was euer respected with
619    man, woman, or childe.
620   *<S {Clo}.> Sir, she was respected with him, before he mar-ried
621    with her.
622   *<S {Esc}.> Which is the wiser here; {Iustice} or {Iniquitie}? Is
623    this true?
624   *<S {Elb}.> O thou caytiffe: O thou varlet: O thou wick-ed
625   *{Hanniball}; I respected with her, before I was married
626   *to her? If euer I was respected with her, or she with me,
627   *let not your worship thinke mee the poore {Dukes} Offi-cer:
628   *proue this, thou wicked {Hanniball}, or ile haue
629    mine action of battry on thee.
630   *<S {Esc}.> If he tooke you a box o'th' eare,  you might haue
631    your action of slander too.
632   *<S {Elb}.> Marry I thanke your good worship for it: what
633   *is't your Worships pleasure I shall doe with this wick-ed
634    Caitiffe?
635   *<S {Esc}.> Truly Officer, because he hath some offences in
636   *him, that thou wouldst discouer, if thou couldst, let him
637   *continue in his courses, till thou knowst what they are.
638   *<S {Elb}.> Marry I thanke your worship for it: Thou seest
639   *thou wicked varlet now, what's come vpon thee. Thou
640    art to continue now thou Varlet, thou art to continue.
641    <S {Esc}.> Where were you borne, friend?
642    <S {Froth}.> Here in {Vienna}, Sir.
643    <S {Esc}.> Are you of fourescore pounds a yeere?
644    <S {Froth}.> Yes, and't please you sir.
645    <S {Esc}.> So: what trade are you of, sir?
646    <S {Clo}.> A Tapster, a poore widdowes Tapster.
647    <S {Esc}.> Your Mistris name?
648    <S {Clo}.> Mistris {Ouer-don}.
649    <S {Esc}.> Hath she had any more then one husband?
650    <S {Clo}.> Nine, sir: {Ouer-don} by the last.
651   *<S {Esc}.> Nine? come hether to me, Master {Froth}; Master
652   *{#Froth}, I would not haue you acquainted with Tapsters;
653   *they will draw you Master {Froth}, and you wil hang them:
654    get you gon, and let me heare no more of you.
655   *<S {Fro}.> I thanke your worship: for mine owne part, I
656   *neuer come into any roome in a Tap- house, but I am
657    drawne in.
658   *<S {Esc}.> Well: no more of it Master {Froth}: farewell:
659   *Come you hether to me, Mr. Tapster: what's your name
660    Mr. Tapster?
661    <S {Clo}.> {Pompey}.
662    <S {Esc}.> What else?
663    <S {Clo}.> {Bum}, Sir.
664   *<S {Esc}.> Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about
665   *you, so that in the beastliest sence, you are {Pompey} the
666   *great; {Pompey}, you are partly a bawd, {Pompey}; howso-euer
667   *you colour it in being a Tapster, are you not? come,
668    tell me true, it shall be the better for you.
669    <S {Clo}.> Truly sir, I am a poore fellow that would liue.
670   *<S {Esc}.> How would you liue {Pompey}? by being a bawd?
671   *what doe you thinke of the trade {Pompey}? is it a lawfull
672    trade?
673    <S {Clo}.> If the Law would allow it, sir.
674   *<S {Esc}.> But the Law will not allow it {Pompey}; nor it
675    shall not be allowed in {Vienna}.
676   *<S {Clo}.> Do's your Worship meane to geld and splay all
677    the youth of the City?
678    <S {Esc}.> No, {Pompey}.
679   *<S {Clo}.> Truely Sir, in my poore opinion they will too't
680   *then: if your worship will take order for the drabs and
681    the knaues, you need not to feare the bawds.
682   *<S {Esc}.> There is pretty orders beginning I can tell you:
683    It is but heading, and hanging.
684   *<S {Clo}.> If you head, and hang all that offend that way
685   *but for ten yeare together; you'll be glad to giue out a
686   *Commission for more heads: if this law hold in {Vienna}
687   *ten yeare, ile rent the fairest house in it after three pence
688   *a Bay: if you liue to see this come to passe, say {Pompey}
689    told you so.
690   *<S {Esc}.> Thanke you good {Pompey}; and in requitall of
691   *your prophesie, harke you: I aduise you let me not finde
692   *you before me againe vpon any complaint whatsoeuer;
693   *no, not for dwelling where you doe: if I doe {Pompey}, I
694   *shall beat you to your Tent, and proue a shrewd {Caesar}
695   *to you: in plaine dealing {Pompey}, I shall haue you whipt;
696    so for this time, {Pompey}, fare you well.
697   *<S {Clo}.> I thanke your Worship for your good counsell;
698   *but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better
699   *determine. Whip me? no, no, let Carman whip his Iade,
700    The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.  <D {Exit}.>
701   *<S {Esc}.> Come hether to me, Master {Elbow}: come hither
702   *Master Constable: how long haue you bin in this place
703    of Constable?
704    <S {Elb}.> Seuen yeere, and a halfe sir.
705   *<S {Esc}.> I thought by the readinesse in the office, you had
706    continued in it some time: you say seauen yeares toge-ther.
707   _
708    <S {Elb}.> And a halfe sir.
709   *<S {Esc}.> Alas, it hath beene great paines to you: they do
710   *you wrong to put you so oft vpon't. Are there not men
711    in your Ward sufficient to serue it?
712   *<S {Elb}.> 'Faith sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
713   *are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it
714    for some peece of money, and goe through with all.
715   *<S {Esc}.> Looke you bring mee in the names of some sixe
716    or seuen, the most sufficient of your parish.
717    <S {Elb}.> To your Worships house sir?
718   *<S {Esc}.> To my house: fare you well: what's #a clocke,
719    thinke you?
720    <S {Iust}.> Eleuen, Sir.
721    <S {Esc}.> I pray you home to dinner with me.
722    <S {Iust}.> I humbly thanke you.
723    <S {Esc}.> It grieues me for the death of {Claudio}
724    But there's no remedie:
725    <S {Iust}.> Lord {Angelo} is seuere.
726    <S {Esc}.> It is but needfull.
727    Mercy is not it selfe, that oft lookes so,
728    Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
729    But yet, poore {Claudio}; there is no remedie.
730    Come Sir.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P F4>
731    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
732    <D {Enter Prouost, Seruant}.>
733   *<S {Ser}.> Hee's hearing of a Cause; he will come straight,
734    I'le tell him of you.
735    <S {Pro}.> 'Pray you doe; Ile know
736    His pleasure, may be he will relent; alas
737    He hath but as offended in a dreame,
738    All Sects, all Ages smack of this vice, and he
739    To die for't?
740    <D {Enter Angelo}.>
741    <S {Ang}.> Now, what's the matter {Prouost}?
742    <S {Pro}.> Is it your #will {Claudio} shall die to morrow?
743    <S {Ang}.> Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
744    Why do'st thou aske againe?
745    <S {Pro}.> Lest I might be too rash:
746    Vnder your good correction I haue seene
747    When after execution, Iudgement hath
748    Repented ore his doome.
749    <S {Ang}.> Goe to; let that be mine,
750    Doe you your office, or giue vp your Place,
751    And you shall  well be spar'd.
752    <S {Pro}.> I craue your Honours pardon:
753    What shall be done Sir, with the groaning {Iuliet}?
754    Shee's very neere her howre.
755    <S {Ang}.> Dispose of her
756    To some more fitter place; and that with speed.
757    <S {Ser}.> Here is the sister of the man condemn'd,
758    Desires accesse to you.
759    <S {Ang}.> Hath he a Sister?
760    <S {Pro}.> #I my good Lord, a very vertuous maid,
761    And to be shortlie of a Sister- hood,
762    If not alreadie.
763    <S {Ang}.> Well: let her be admitted,
764    See you the Fornicatresse be remou'd,
765    Let her haue needfull, but not lauish meanes,
766    There shall be order for't.
767    <D {Enter Lucio and Isabella}.>
768    <S {Pro}.> 'Saue your Honour.
769   *<S {Ang}.> Stay a little while: y'are welcome: what's your |(#will?
770    <S {Isab}.> I am a wofull Sutor to your Honour,
771    'Please but your Honor heare me.
772    <S {Ang}.> Well: what's your suite.
773    <S {Isab}.> There is a vice that most I doe abhorre,
774    And most desire should meet the blow of Iustice;
775    For which I would not plead, but that I must,
776    For which I must not plead, but that I am
777    At warre, twixt #will, and will not.
778    <S {Ang}.> Well: the matter?
779    <S {Isab}.> I haue a brother is condemn'd to die,
780    I doe beseech you let it be his fault,
781    And not my brother.
782    <S {Pro}.> Heauen giue thee mouing graces.
783    <S {Ang}.> Condemne the fault, and not the actor of it,
784    Why euery fault's condemnd ere it be done:
785    Mine were the verie Cipher of a Function
786    To fine the faults, whose fine stands in record,
787    And let goe by the Actor.
788    <S {Isab}.> Oh iust, but seuere Law:
789    I had a brother then; heauen keepe your honour.
790    <S {Luc}.> Giue't not ore so: to him againe, entreat him,
791    Kneele downe before him, hang vpon his gowne,
792    You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
793    You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
794    To him, I say.
795    <S {Isab}.> Must he needs die?
796    <S {Ang}.> Maiden, no remedie.
797    <S {Isab}.> Yes: I doe thinke that you might pardon him,
798    And neither heauen, nor man grieue at the mercy.
799    <S {Ang}.> I will not doe't.
800    <S {Isab}.> But can you if you would?
801    <S {Ang}.> Looke what I will not, that I cannot doe.
802   *<S {Isab}.> But might you doe't & do the world no wrong
803    If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse,
804    As mine is to him?
805    <S {Ang}.> Hee's sentenc'd, tis too late.
806    <S {Luc}.> You are too cold.
807    <S {Isab}.> Too late? why no: I that doe speak a word
808    May call it againe: well, beleeue this
809    No ceremony that to great ones longs,
810    Not the Kings Crowne; nor the deputed sword,
811    The Marshalls Truncheon, nor the Iudges Robe
812    Become them with one halfe so good a grace
813    As mercie does: If he had bin as you, and you as he,
814    You would haue slipt like him, but he like you
815    Would not haue beene so sterne.
816    <S {Ang}.> Pray you be gone.
817    <S {Isab}.> I would to heauen I had your potencie,
818    And you were {Isabell}: should it then be thus?
819    No: I would tell what 'twere to be a Iudge,
820    And what a prisoner.
821    <S {Luc}.> #I, touch him: there's the veine.
822    <S {Ang}.> Your Brother is a forfeit of the Law,
823    And you but waste your words.
824    <S {Isab}.> Alas, alas:
825    Why all the soules that were, were forfeit once,
826    And he that might the vantage best haue tooke,
827    Found out the remedie: how would you be,
828    If he, which is the top of Iudgement, should
829    But iudge you, as you are? Oh, thinke on that,
830    And mercie then will breathe within your lips
831    Like man new made.
832    <S {Ang}.> Be you content, (faire Maid)
833    It is the Law, not I, condemne your brother,
834    Were he my kinsman, brother, or my sonne,
835    It should be thus with him: he must die to morrow.
836    <S {Isab}.> To morrow? oh, that's sodaine,
837    Spare him, spare him:
838    Hee's not prepar'd for death; euen for our kitchins
839    We kill the fowle of season: shall we serue heauen
840    With lesse respect then we doe minister
841   *To our   grosse- selues? good, good my Lord, bethink you;
842    Who is it that hath #di'd for this offence?
843    There's many haue committed it.
844    <S {Luc}.> #I, well said.
845   *<S {Ang}.> The Law hath not bin dead, thogh it hath slept
846    Those many had not dar'd to doe that euill
847    If the first, that did th' Edict infringe
848    Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
849    Takes note of what is done, and like a Prophet
850    Lookes in a glasse that shewes what future euils
851    Either now, or by remissenesse, new conceiu'd,
852    And so in progresse to be hatch'd, and borne,
853    Are now to haue no successiue degrees,
854    But here they liue to end.
855    <S {Isab}.> Yet shew some pittie.
856    <S {Ang}.> I shew it most of all, when I show Iustice;
857    For then I pittie those I doe not know,
858    Which a dismis'd offence, would after gaule
      <P F4v>
859    And doe him right, that answering one foule wrong
860    Liues not to act another. Be satisfied;
861    Your Brother dies to morrow; be content.
862   *<S {Isab}.> So you must be y first that giues this sentence,
863    And hee, that suffers: Oh, it is excellent
864    To haue a Giants strength: but it is tyrannous
865    To vse it like a Giant.
866    <S {Luc}.> That's well said.
867    <S {Isab}.> Could great men thunder
868    As {Ioue} himselfe do's, {Ioue} would neuer be quiet,
869    For euery pelting petty Officer
870    Would vse his heauen for thunder;
871    Nothing but thunder: Mercifull heauen,
872    Thou rather with thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt
873    Splits the vn- wedgable and gnarled Oke,
874    Then the soft Mertill: But man, proud man,
875    Drest in a little briefe authoritie,
876    Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
877    (His glassie Essence) like an angry Ape
878    Plaies such phantastique tricks before high heauen,
879    As makes the Angels weepe: who with our spleenes,
880    Would all themselues laugh mortall.
881    <S {Luc}.> Oh, to him, to him wench: he will relent,
882    Hee's comming: I perceiue't.
883    <S {Pro}.> Pray heauen she win him.
884    <S {Isab}.> We cannot weigh our brother with our selfe,
885    Great men may iest with Saints: tis wit in them,
886    But in the lesse fowle prophanation.
887    <S {Luc}.> Thou'rt i'th right (Girle) more o'that.
888   *<S {Isab}.> That in the Captaine's but a chollericke word,
889    Which in the Souldier is flat blasphemie.
890    <S {Luc}.> Art auis'd o'that? more  on't.
891    <S {Ang}.> Why doe you put these sayings vpon me?
892    <S {Isab}.> Because Authoritie, though it erre like others,
893    Hath yet a kinde of medicine in it selfe
894    That skins the vice o'th top; goe to your bosome,
895    Knock there, and aske your heart what it doth know
896    That's like my brothers fault: if it confesse
897    A naturall guiltinesse, such as is his,
898    Let it not sound a thought vpon your tongue
899    Against my brothers life.
900    <S {Ang}.> Shee speakes, and 'tis such sence
901    That my Sence breeds with it; fare you well.
902    <S {Isab}.> Gentle my Lord, turne backe.
903    <S {Ang}.> I will bethinke me: come againe to morrow.
904   *<S {Isa}.> Hark, how Ile bribe you: good my Lord turn back.
905    <S {Ang}.> How? bribe me?
906   *<S {Is}.> #I, with such gifts that heauen shall share with you.
907    <S {Luc}.> You had mar'd all else.
908    <S {Isab}.> Not with fond Sickles of the tested- gold,
909    Or Stones, whose rate are either rich, or poore
910    As fancie values them: but with true prayers,
911    That shall be vp at heauen, and enter there
912    Ere Sunne rise: prayers from preserued soules,
913    From fasting Maides, whose mindes are dedicate
914    To nothing temporall.
915    <S {Ang}.> Well: come to me to morrow.
916    <S {Luc}.> Goe to: 'tis well; away.
917    <S {Isab}.> Heauen keepe your honour safe.
918    <S {Ang}.> Amen.
919    For I am that way going to temptation,
920    Where prayers crosse.
921    <S {Isab}.> At what hower to morrow,
922    Shall I attend your Lordship?
923    <S {Ang}.> At any time 'fore- noone.
924    <S {Isab}.> 'Saue your Honour.
925    <S {Ang}.> From thee: euen from thy vertue.
926    What's this? what's this? is this her fault, or mine?
927    The Tempter, or the Tempted, who sins most? ha?
928    Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I,
929    That, lying by the Violet in the Sunne,
930    Doe as the Carrion do's, not as the flowre,
931    Corrupt with vertuous season: Can it be,
932    That Modesty may more betray our Sence
933   *Then womans lightnesse? hauing waste ground enough,
934    Shall we desire to raze the Sanctuary
935    And pitch our euils there? oh fie, fie, fie:
936    What dost thou? or what art thou {Angelo}?
937    Dost thou desire her fowly, for those things
938    That make her good? oh, let her brother liue:
939    Theeues for their robbery haue authority,
940    When Iudges steale themselues: what, doe I loue her,
941    That I desire to heare her speake againe?
942    And feast vpon her eyes? what is't I dreame on?
943    Oh cunning enemy, that to catch a Saint,
944    With Saints dost bait thy hooke: most dangerous
945    Is that temptation, that doth goad vs on
946    To sinne, in louing vertue: neuer could the Strumpet
947    With all her double vigor, #Art, and Nature
948    Once stir my temper: but this vertuous Maid
949    Subdues me quite: Euer till now
950   *When men were fond, I smild, and wondred how.  <D {Exit}.>
951    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
952    <D {Enter Duke and Prouost}.>
953    <S {Duke}.> Haile to you, {Prouost}, so I thinke you are.
954   *<S {Pro}.> I am the Prouost: whats your #will, good Frier?
955    <S {Duke}.> Bound by my charity, and my blest order,
956    I come to visite the afflicted spirits
957    Here in the prison: doe me the common right
958    To let me see them: and to make me know
959    The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
960    To them accordingly.
961   *<S {Pro}.> I would do more then that, if more were needfull
962    <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
963    Looke here comes one: a Gentlewoman of mine,
964    Who falling in the flawes of her owne youth,
965    Hath blisterd her report: She is with childe,
966    And he that got it, sentenc'd: a yong man,
967    More fit to doe another such offence,
968    Then dye for this.
969    <S {Duk}.> When must he dye?
970    <S {Pro}.> As I do thinke to morrow.
971    I haue prouided for you, stay #a while
972    And you shall be conducted.
973    <S {Duk}.> Repent you (faire one) of the sin you carry?
974    <S {Iul}.> I doe; and beare the shame most patiently.
975   *<S {Du}.> Ile teach you how you shal araign your conscie[n]ce
976    And try your penitence, if it be sound,
977    Or hollowly put on.
978    <S {Iul}.> Ile gladly learne.
979    <S {Duk}.> Loue you the man that wrong'd you?
980    <S {Iul}.> Yes, as I loue the woman that wrong'd him.
981    <S {Duk}.> So then it seemes your most offence full act
982    Was mutually committed.
983    <S {Iul}.> Mutually.
984    <S {Duk}.> Then was your sin of heauier kinde then his.
985    <S {Iul}.> I doe confesse it, and repent it (Father.)
      <P F5>
986   *<S {Duk}.> 'Tis meet so (daughter) but least you do repent
987    As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
988    Which sorrow is alwaies toward our selues, not heauen,
989    Showing we would not spare heauen, as we loue it,
990    But as we stand in feare.
991    <S {Iul}.> I doe repent me, as it is an euill,
992    And take the shame with ioy.
993    <S {Duke}.> There rest:
994    Your partner (as I heare) must die to morrow,
995    And I am going with instruction to him:
996    Grace goe with you, {Benedicite}.  <D {Exit}.>
997    <S {Iul}.> Must die to morrow? oh iniurious Loue
998    That respits me a life, whose very comfort
999    Is still a dying horror.
1000   <S {Pro}.> 'Tis pitty of him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1001   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1002   <D {Enter Angelo}.>
1003  *<S {An}.> When I would pray, & think, I thinke, and pray
1004   To seuerall subiects: heauen hath my empty words,
1005   Whilst my Inuention,  hearing not my Tongue,
1006   Anchors on {Isabell}: heauen in my mouth,
1007   As if I did but onely chew his name,
1008   And in my heart the strong and swelling euill
1009   Of my conception: the state whereon I studied
1010   Is like a good thing, being often read
1011   Growne feard, and tedious: yea, my Grauitie
1012   Wherein (let no man heare me) I take pride,
1013   Could I, with boote, change for an idle plume
1014   Which the ayre beats for vaine: oh place, oh forme,
1015   How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit
1016   Wrench awe from fooles, and tye the wiser soules
1017   To thy false seeming? Blood, thou art blood,
1018   Let's write good Angell on the Deuills horne
1019   'Tis not the Deuills Crest: how now? who's there?
1020   <D {Enter Seruant}.>
1021   <S {Ser}.> One {Isabell}, a Sister, desires accesse to you.
1022   <S {Ang}.> Teach her the way: oh, heauens
1023   Why doe's my bloud thus muster to my heart,
1024   Making both it vnable for it selfe,
1025   And dispossessing all my other parts
1026   Of necessary fitnesse?
1027   So play the foolish throngs with one that swounds,
1028   Come all to help him, and so stop the ayre
1029   By which hee should reuiue: and euen so
1030   The generall subiect to a wel- wisht King
1031   Quit their owne part, and in obsequious fondnesse
1032   Crowd to his presence, where their vn- taught loue
1033   Must needs appear offence: how now faire Maid.
1034   <D {Enter Isabella}.>
1035   <S {Isab}.> I am come to know your pleasure.
1036  *<S {An}.> That you might know it, wold much better please |(me,
1037   Then to demand what 'tis: your Brother cannot liue.
1038   <S {Isab}.> Euen so: heauen keepe your Honor.
1039   <S {Ang}.> Yet may he liue #a while: and it may be
1040   As long as you, or I: yet he must die.
1041   <S {Isab}.> Vnder your Sentence?
1042   <S {Ang}.> Yea.
1043   <S {Isab}.> When, I beseech you: that in his Reprieue
1044   (Longer, or shorter) he may be so fitted
1045   That his soule sicken not.
1046   <S {Ang}.> Ha? fie, these filthy vices: It were as good
      <C D>
1047   To pardon him, that hath from nature stolne
1048   A man already made, as to remit
1049   Their sawcie sweetnes, that do coyne heauens Image
1050   In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easie,
1051   Falsely to take away a life true made,
1052   As to put mettle in restrained meanes
1053   To make a false one.
1054   <S {Isab}.> 'Tis set downe so in heauen, but not in earth.
1055   <S {Ang}.> Say you so: then I shall poze you quickly.
1056   Which had you rather, that the most iust Law
1057   Now tooke your brothers life, and to redeeme him
1058   Giue vp your body to such sweet vncleannesse
1059   As she that he hath staind?
1060   <S {Isab}.> Sir, beleeue this.
1061   I had rather giue my body, then my soule.
1062   <S {Ang}.> I talke not of your soule: our compel'd sins
1063   Stand more for number, then for accompt.
1064   <S {Isab}.> How say you?
1065   <S {Ang}.> Nay Ile not warrant that: for I can speake
1066   Against the thing I say: Answere to this,
1067   I (now the voyce of the recorded Law)
1068   Pronounce a sentence on your Brothers life,
1069   Might there not be a charitie in sinne,
1070   To saue this Brothers life?
1071   <S {Isab}.> Please you to doo't,
1072   Ile take it as a perill to my soule,
1073   It is no sinne at all, but charitie.
1074   <S {Ang}.> Pleas'd you to doo't, at perill of your soule
1075   Were equall poize of sinne, and charitie.
1076   <S {Isab}.> That I do beg his life, if it be sinne
1077   Heauen let me beare it: you granting of my suit,
1078   If that be sin, Ile make it my Morne- praier,
1079   To haue it added to the faults of mine,
1080   And nothing of your answere.
1081   <S {Ang}.> Nay, but heare me,
1082   Your sence pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
1083   Or seeme so crafty; and that's not good.
1084   <S {Isab}.> Let be ignorant, and in nothing good,
1085   But graciously to know I am  no better.
1086  *<S {Ang}.> Thus wisdome wishes to appeare most bright,
1087   When it doth taxe it selfe: As these blacke Masques
1088   Proclaime an en- shield beauty ten times louder
1089   Then beauty could displaied: But marke me,
1090   To be receiued plaine, Ile speake more grosse:
1091   Your Brother is to dye.
1092   <S {Isab}.> So.
1093   <S {Ang}.> And his offence is so, as it appeares,
1094   Accountant to the Law, vpon that paine.
1095   <S {Isab}.> True.
1096   <S {Ang}.> Admit no other way to saue his life
1097   (As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
1098   But in the losse of question) that you, his Sister,
1099   Finding your selfe desir'd of such a person,
1100   Whose creadit with the Iudge, or owne great place,
1101   Could fetch your Brother from the Manacles
1102   Of the all- building- Law: and that there were
1103   No earthly meane to saue him, but that either
1104   You must lay downe the treasures of your body,
1105   To this supposed, or else to let him suffer:
1106   What would you doe?
1107   <S {Isab}.> As much for my poore Brother, as my selfe;
1108   That is: were I vnder the tearmes of death,
1109   Th' impression of keene whips, I'ld weare as Rubies,
1110   And strip my selfe to death, as to a bed,
1111   That longing haue bin sicke for, ere I'ld yeeld
1112   My body vp to shame.
      <P F5v><C B>
1113   <S {Ang}.> Then must your brother die.
1114   <S {Isa}.> And 'twer the cheaper way:
1115   Better it were a brother dide at once,
1116   Then that a sister, by redeeming him
1117   Should die for euer.
1118   <S {Ang}.> Were not you then as cruell as the Sentence,
1119   That you haue slander'd so?
1120   <S {Isa}.> Ignomie in ransome, and free pardon
1121   Are of two houses: lawfull mercie,
1122   Is nothing kin to fowle redemption.
1123  *<S {Ang}.> You seem'd of late to make the Law a tirant,
1124   And rather prou'd the sliding of your brother
1125   A merriment, then a vice.
1126   <S {Isa}.> Oh pardon me my Lord, it oft fals out
1127   To haue, what we would haue,
1128   We speake not what we meane;
1129   I something do excuse the thing I hate,
1130   For his aduantage that I dearely loue.
1131   <S {Ang}.> We are all fraile.
1132   <S {Isa}.> Else let my brother die,
1133   If not a fedarie but onely he
1134   Owe, and succeed thy weaknesse.
1135   <S {Ang}.> Nay, women are fraile too.
1136   <S {Isa}.> #I, as the glasses where they view themselues,
1137   Which are as easie broke as they make formes:
1138   Women? Helpe heauen; men their creation marre
1139   In profiting by them: Nay, call vs ten times fraile,
1140   For we are soft, as our complexions are,
1141   And credulous to false prints.
1142   <S {Ang}.> I thinke it well:
1143   And from this testimonie of your owne sex
1144   (Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
1145   Then faults may shake our frames) let me be bold;
1146   I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
1147   That is a woman; if you be more, #you'r none.
1148   If you be one (as you are well exprest
1149   By all externall warrants) shew it now,
1150   By putting on the destin'd Liuerie.
1151   <S {Isa}.> I haue no tongue but one; gentle my Lord,
1152   Let me entreate you speake the former language.
1153   <S {Ang}.> Plainlie conceiue I loue you.
1154   <S {Isa}.> My brother did loue {Iuliet},
1155   And you tell me that he shall die for't.
1156   <S {Ang}.> He shall not {Isabell} if you giue me loue.
1157   <S {Isa}.> I know your vertue hath a licence in't,
1158   Which seemes a little fouler then it is,
1159   To plucke on others.
1160   <S {Ang}.> Beleeue me on mine Honor,
1161   My words expresse my purpose.
1162   <S {Isa}.> Ha? Little honor, to be much beleeu'd,
1163   And most pernitious purpose: Seeming, seeming.
1164   I will proclaime thee {Angelo}, looke for't.
1165   Signe me a present pardon for my brother,
1166  *Or with an out- stretcht throate Ile tell the world aloud
1167   What man thou art.
1168   <S {Ang}.> Who will beleeue thee {Isabell}?
1169   My vnsoild name, th' austeerenesse of my life,
1170   My vouch against you, and my place i'th State,
1171   Will so your accusation ouer- weigh,
1172   That you shall stifle in your owne report,
1173   And smell of calumnie. I haue begun,
1174   And now I giue my sensuall race, the reine,
1175   Fit thy consent to my sharpe appetite,
1176   Lay by all nicetie, and prolixious blushes
1177  *That banish what they sue for: Redeeme thy brother,
1178   By yeelding vp thy bodie to my #will,
1179   Or else he must not onelie die the death,
1180   But thy vnkindnesse shall his death draw out
1181   To lingring sufferance: Answer me to morrow,
1182   Or by the affection that now guides me most,
1183   Ile proue a Tirant to him. As for you,
1184  *Say what you can; my false, ore- weighs your true.  <D {Exit}>
1185   <S {Isa}.> To whom should I complaine? Did I tell this,
1186   Who would beleeue me? O perilous mouthes
1187   That beare in them, one and the selfesame tongue,
1188   Either of condemnation, or approofe,
1189   Bidding the Law make curtsie to their #will,
1190   Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
1191   To follow as it drawes. Ile to my brother,
1192   Though he hath falne by prompture of the blood,
1193   Yet hath he in him such a minde of Honor,
1194   That had he twentie heads to tender downe
1195   On twentie bloodie blockes, hee'ld yeeld them vp,
1196   Before his sister should her bodie stoope
1197   To such abhord pollution.
1198   Then {Isabell} liue chaste, and brother die;
1199   "More then our Brother, is our Chastitie.
1200   Ile tell him yet of {Angelo's} request,
1201   And fit his minde to death, for his soules rest.  <D {Exit}.>
1202   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1203   <D {Enter Duke, Claudio, and Prouost}.>
1204  *<S {Du}.> So then you hope of pardon from Lord {Angelo}?
1205   <S {Cla}.> The miserable haue no other medicine
1206  *But onely hope: I'haue hope to liue, and am prepar'd to
1207   die.
1208   <S {Duke}.> Be absolute for death: either death or life
1209   Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
1210   If I do loose thee, I do loose a thing
1211   That none but fooles would keepe: a breath thou art,
1212   Seruile to all the skyie- influences
1213   That dost this habitation where thou keepst
1214   Hourely afflict: Meerely, thou art deaths foole,
1215   For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun,
1216   And yet runst toward him still. Thou art not noble,
1217   For all th' accommodations that thou bearst,
1218  *Are nurst by basenesse: Thou'rt by no meanes valiant,
1219   For thou dost feare the soft and tender forke
1220   Of a poore worme: thy best of rest is sleepe,
1221   And that thou oft prouoakst, yet grosselie fearst
1222   Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thy selfe,
1223   For thou exists on manie a thousand graines
1224   That issue out of dust. Happie thou art not,
1225   For what thou hast not, still thou striu'st to get,
1226   And what thou hast forgetst. Thou art not certaine,
1227   For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
1228   After the Moone: If thou art rich, thou'rt poore,
1229   For like an Asse, whose backe with Ingots bowes;
1230   Thou bearst thy heauie riches but a iournie,
1231   And death vnloads thee; Friend hast thou none.
1232   For thine owne bowels which do call thee, fire
1233   The meere effusion of thy proper loines
1234   Do curse the Gowt, Sapego, and the Rheume
1235  *For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth, nor age
1236   But as it were an after- dinners sleepe
1237   Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth
1238   Becomes as aged, and doth begge the almes
1239   Of palsied- Eld: and when thou art old, and rich
      <P F6>
1240   Thou hast neither heate, affection, limbe, nor beautie
1241   To make thy riches pleasant: what's yet in this
1242   That beares the name of life? Yet in this life
1243   Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we feare
1244   That makes these oddes, all euen.
1245   <S {Cla}.> I humblie thanke you.
1246   To sue to liue, I finde I seeke to die,
1247   And seeking death, finde life: Let it come on.
1248   <D {Enter Isabella}.>
1249  *<S {Isab}.> What hoa? Peace heere; Grace, and good com-panie.
1250  _
1251  *<S {Pro}.> Who's there? Come in, the wish deserues a
1252   welcome.
1253   <S {Duke}.> Deere sir, ere long Ile visit you againe.
1254   <S {Cla}.> Most holie Sir, I thanke you.
1255   <S {Isa}.> My businesse is a word or two with {Claudio}.
1256  *<S {Pro}.> And verie welcom: looke Signior, here's your
1257   sister.
1258   <S {Duke}.> Prouost, a word with you.
1259   <S {Pro}.> As manie as you please.
1260  *<S {Duke}.> Bring them to heare me speak, where I may be
1261   conceal'd.
1262   <S {Cla}.> Now sister, what's the comfort?
1263   <S {Isa}.> Why,
1264   As all comforts are: most good, most good indeede,
1265   Lord {Angelo} hauing affaires to heauen
1266   Intends you for his swift Ambassador,
1267   Where you shall be an euerlasting Leiger;
1268   Therefore your best appointment make with speed,
1269   To Morrow you set on.
1270   <S {Clau}.> Is there no remedie?
1271   <S {Isa}.> None, but such remedie, as to saue a head
1272   To cleaue a heart in twaine:
1273   <S {Clau}.> But is there anie?
1274   <S {Isa}.> Yes brother, you may liue;
1275   There is a diuellish mercie in the Iudge,
1276   If you'l implore it, that will free your life,
1277   But fetter you till death.
1278   <S {Cla}.> Perpetuall durance?
1279   <S {Isa}.> #I iust, perpetuall durance, a restraint
1280   Through all the worlds vastiditie you had
1281   To a determin'd scope.
1282   <S {Clau}.> But in what nature?
1283   <S {Isa}.> In such a one, as you consenting too't,
1284   Would barke your honor from that trunke you beare,
1285   And leaue you naked.
1286   <S {Clau}.> Let me know the point.
1287   <S {Isa}.> Oh, I do feare thee {Claudio}, and I quake,
1288   Least thou a feauorous life shouldst entertaine,
1289   And six or seuen winters more respect
1290   Then a perpetuall Honor. Dar'st thou die?
1291   The sence of death is most in apprehension,
1292   And the poore Beetle that we treade vpon
1293   In corporall sufferance, finds a pang as great,
1294   As when a Giant dies.
1295   <S {Cla}.> Why giue you me this shame?
1296   Thinke you I can a resolution fetch
1297   From flowrie tendernesse? If I must die,
1298   I will encounter darknesse as a bride,
1299   And hugge it in mine armes.
1300  *<S {Isa}.> There spake my brother: there my fathers graue
1301   Did vtter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
1302   Thou art too noble, to conserue a life
1303   In base appliances. This outward sainted Deputie,
1304   Whose setled visage, and deliberate word
1305   Nips youth i'th head, and follies doth emmew
1306   As Falcon doth the Fowle, is yet a diuell:
1307   His filth within being cast, he would appeare
1308   A pond, as deepe as #hell.
1309   <S {Cla}.> The prenzie, {Angelo}?
1310   <S {Isa}.> Oh 'tis the cunning Liuerie of #hell,
1311   The damnest bodie to inuest, and couer
1312   In prenzie gardes; dost thou thinke {Claudio},
1313   If I would yeeld him my virginitie
1314   Thou might'st be freed?
1315   <S {Cla}.> Oh heauens, it cannot be.
1316  *<S {Isa}.> Yes, he would giu't thee; from this rank offence
1317   So to offend him still. This night's the time
1318   That I should do what I abhorre to name,
1319   Or else thou diest to morrow.
1320   <S {Clau}.> Thou shalt not do't.
1321   <S {Isa}.> O, were it but my life,
1322   I'de throw it downe for your deliuerance
1323   As frankely as a pin.
1324   <S {Clau}.> Thankes deere {Isabell}.
1325   <S {Isa}.> Be readie {Claudio}, for your death to morrow.
1326   <S {Clau}.> Yes. Has he affections in him,
1327   That thus can make him bite the Law by th' nose,
1328   When he would force it? Sure it is no sinne,
1329   Or of the deadly seuen it is the least.
1330   <S {Isa}.> Which is the least?
1331   <S {Cla}.> If it were damnable, he being so wise,
1332   Why would he for the momentarie tricke
1333   Be perdurablie fin'de? Oh {Isabell}.
1334   <S {Isa}.> What saies my brother?
1335   <S {Cla}.> Death is a fearefull thing.
1336   <S {Isa}.> And shamed life, a hatefull.
1337   <S {Cla}.> #I, but to die, and go we know not where,
1338   To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot,
1339   This sensible warme motion, to become
1340   A kneaded clod; And the delighted spirit
1341   To bath in fierie floods, or to recide
1342   In thrilling Region of thicke- ribbed Ice,
1343   To be imprison'd in the viewlesse windes
1344   And blowne with restlesse violence round about
1345   The pendant world: or to be worse then worst
1346   Of those, that lawlesse and incertaine thought,
1347   Imagine howling, 'tis too horrible.
1348   The weariest, and most loathed worldly life
1349   That Age, Ache, periury, and imprisonment
1350   Can lay on nature, is a Paradise
1351   To what we feare of death.
1352   <S {Isa}.> Alas, alas.
1353   <S {Cla}.> Sweet Sister, let me liue.
1354   What sinne you do, to saue a brothers life,
1355   Nature dispenses with the deede so farre,
1356   That it becomes a vertue.
1357   <S {Isa}.> Oh you beast,
1358   Oh faithlesse Coward, oh dishonest wretch,
1359   Wilt thou be made a man, out of my vice?
1360   Is't not a kinde of Incest, to take life
1361  *From thine owne sisters shame? What should I thinke,
1362   Heauen shield my Mother plaid my Father faire:
1363   For such a warped slip of wildernesse
1364   Nere issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance,
1365   Die, perish: Might but my bending downe
1366   Repreeue thee from thy fate, it should proceede.
1367   Ile pray a thousand praiers for thy death,
1368   No word to saue thee.
1369   <S {Cla}.> Nay heare me {Isabell}.
1370   <S {Isa}.> Oh fie, fie, fie:
1371   Thy sinn's not accidentall, but a Trade;
      <P F6v><C C>
1372   Mercy to thee would proue it selfe a Bawd,
1373   'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
1374   <S {Cla}.> Oh heare me {Isabella}.
1375   <S {Duk}.> Vouchsafe a word, yong sister, but one word.
1376   <S {Isa}.> What is your #Will.
1377  *<S {Duk}.> Might you dispense with your leysure, I would
1378  *by and #by haue some speech with you: the satisfaction I
1379   would require, is likewise your owne benefit.
1380  *<S {Isa}.> I haue no superfluous leysure, my stay must be
1381  *stolen out of other affaires: but I will attend you #a while.
1382  *<S {Duke}.> Son, I haue ouer- heard what hath past between
1383  *you & your sister. {Angelo} had neuer the purpose to cor-rupt
1384  *her; onely he hath made an assay of her vertue, to
1385  *practise his iudgement with the disposition of natures.
1386  *She (hauing the truth of honour in her) hath made him
1387  *that gracious deniall, which he is most glad to receiue: I
1388  *am Confessor to {Angelo}, and I know this to be true, ther-fore
1389  *prepare your selfe to death: do not satisfie your re-solution
1390  *with hopes that are fallible, to morrow you
1391   must die, goe to your knees, and make ready.
1392  *<S {Cla}.> Let me ask my sister pardon, I am so out of loue
1393   with life, that I will sue to be rid of it.
1394  *<S {Duke}.> Hold you there: farewell: {Prouost}, a word
1395   with you.
1396   <S {Pro}.> What's your #will (father?)
1397  *<S {Duk}.> That now you are come, you wil be gone: leaue
1398  *me #a while with the Maid, my minde promises with my
1399   habit, no losse shall touch her by my company.
1400   <S {Pro}.> In good time.  <D {Exit}.>
1401  *<S {Duk}.> The hand that hath made you faire, hath made
1402  *you good: the goodnes that is cheape in beauty, makes
1403  *beauty briefe in goodnes; but grace being the soule of
1404  *your complexion, shall keepe the body of it euer faire:
1405  *the assault that {Angelo} hath made to you, Fortune hath
1406  *conuaid to my vnderstanding; and but that frailty hath
1407  *examples for his falling, I should wonder at {Angelo}: how
1408  *will you doe to content this Substitute, and to saue your
1409   Brother?
1410  *<S {Isab}.> I am now going to resolue him: I had rather
1411  *my brother die by the Law, then my sonne should be vn-lawfullie
1412  *borne. But (oh) how much is the good Duke
1413  *deceiu'd in {Angelo}: if euer he returne, and I can speake
1414  *to him, I will open my lips in vaine, or discouer his go-uernment.
1415  _
1416  *<S {Duke}.> That shall not be much amisse: yet, as the mat-ter
1417  *now stands, he will auoid your accusation: he made
1418  *triall of you onelie. Therefore fasten your eare on my
1419  *aduisings, to the loue I haue in doing good; a remedie
1420  *presents it selfe. I doe make my selfe beleeue that you
1421  *may most vprighteously do a poor wronged Lady a me-rited
1422  *benefit; redeem your brother from the angry Law;
1423  *doe no staine to your owne gracious person, and much
1424  *please the absent Duke, if peraduenture he shall euer re-turne
1425   to haue hearing of this businesse.
1426  *<S {Isab}.> Let me heare you speake farther; I haue spirit to
1427  *do any thing that appeares not fowle in the truth of my
1428   spirit.
1429  *<S {Duke}.> Vertue is bold, and goodnes neuer fearefull:
1430  *Haue you not heard speake of {Mariana} the sister of {Fre-dericke}
1431   the great Souldier, who miscarried at Sea?
1432  *<S {Isa}.> I haue heard of the Lady, and good words went
1433   with her name.
1434  *<S {Duke}.> Shee should this {Angelo} haue married: was af-fianced
1435  *to her oath, and the nuptiall appointed: between
1436  *which time of the contract, and limit of the solemnitie,
1437  *her brother {Fredericke} was wrackt at Sea, hauing in that
1438  *perished vessell, the dowry of his sister: but marke how
1439  *heauily this befell to the poore Gentlewoman, there she
1440  *lost a noble and renowned brother, in his loue toward
1441  *her, euer most kinde and naturall: with him the portion
1442  *and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry: with
1443  *both, her combynate- husband, this well- seeming
1444   {Angelo}.
1445   <S {Isab}.> Can this be so? did {Angelo} so leaue her?
1446  *<S {Duke}.> Left her in her teares, & dried not one of them
1447  *with his comfort: swallowed his vowes whole, preten-ding
1448  *in her, discoueries of dishonor: in few, bestow'd
1449  *her on her owne lamentation, which she yet weares for
1450  *his sake: and he, a marble to her teares, is washed with
1451   them, but relents not.
1452  *<S {Isab}.> What a merit were it in death to take this poore
1453  *maid from the world? what corruption in this life, that
1454  *it will let this man liue? But how out of this can shee a-uaile?
1455  _
1456  *<S {Duke}.> It is a rupture that you may easily heale: and the
1457  *cure of it not onely saues your brother, but keepes you
1458   from dishonor in doing it.
1459   <S {Isab}.> Shew me how (good Father.)
1460  *<S {Duk}.> This fore- named Maid hath yet in her the con-tinuance
1461  *of her first affection: his vniust vnkindenesse
1462  *(that in all reason should haue quenched her loue) hath
1463  *(like an impediment in the Current) made it more vio-lent
1464  *and vnruly: Goe you to {Angelo}, answere his requi-ring
1465  *with a plausible obedience, agree with his demands
1466  *to the point: onely referre your selfe to this aduantage;
1467  *first, that your stay with him may not be long: that the
1468  *time may haue all shadow, and silence in it: and the place
1469  *answere to conuenience: this being granted in course,
1470  *and now followes all: wee shall aduise this wronged
1471  *maid to steed vp your appointment, goe in your place:
1472  *if the encounter acknowledge it selfe heereafter, it may
1473  *compell him to her recompence; and heere, by this is
1474  *your brother saued, your honor vntainted, the poore
1475  *{Mariana} aduantaged, and the corrupt Deputy scaled.
1476  *The Maid will I frame, and make fit for his attempt: if
1477  *you thinke well to carry this as you may, the doublenes
1478  *of the benefit defends the deceit from reproofe. What
1479   thinke you of it?
1480  *<S {Isab}.> The image of it giues me content already, and I
1481   trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
1482  *<S {Duk}.> It lies much in your holding vp: haste you spee-dily
1483  *to {Angelo}, if for this night he intreat you to his bed,
1484  *giue him promise of satisfaction: I will presently to S[aint].
1485  *{Lukes}, there at the moated- Grange recides this deie-cted
1486  *{Mariana}; at that place call vpon me, and dispatch
1487   with {Angelo}, that it may be quickly.
1488  *<S {Isab}.> I thank you for this comfort: fare you well good
1489   father.  <D {Exit}.>
1490   <D {Enter Elbow, Clowne, Officers}.>
1491  *<S {Elb}.> Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you
1492  *will needes buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
1493  *shall haue all the world drinke browne & white bastard.
1494   <S {Duk}.> Oh heauens, what stuffe is heere.
1495  *<S {Clow}.> Twas neuer merry world since of two vsuries
1496  *the merriest was put downe, and the worser allow'd by
1497  *order of Law; a fur'd gowne to keepe him warme; and
1498  *furd with Foxe and Lamb- skins too, to signifie, that craft
1499   being richer then Innocency, stands for the facing.
1500  *<S {Elb}.> Come your way sir: 'blesse you good Father
1501   Frier.
1502  *<S {Duk}.> And you good Brother Father; what offence
1503   hath this man made you, Sir?
      <P G1><C B>
1504  *<S {Elb}.> Marry Sir, he hath offended the Law; and Sir,
1505  *we take him to be a Theefe too Sir: for wee haue found
1506  *vpon him Sir, a strange Pick- lock, which we haue sent
1507   to the Deputie.
1508   <S {Duke}.> Fie, sirrah, a Bawd, a wicked bawd,
1509   The euill that thou causest to be done,
1510   That is thy meanes to liue. Do thou but thinke
1511   What 'tis to cram a maw, or cloath a backe
1512   From such a filthie vice: say to thy selfe,
1513   From their abhominable and beastly touches
1514   I drinke, I eate away my selfe, and liue:
1515   Canst thou beleeue thy liuing is a life,
1516   So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
1517   <S {Clo}.> Indeed, it do's stinke in some sort, Sir:
1518   But yet Sir I would proue.
1519  *<S {Duke}.> Nay, if the diuell haue giuen thee proofs for sin
1520   Thou wilt proue his. Take him to prison Officer:
1521   Correction, and Instruction must both worke
1522   Ere this rude beast will profit.
1523  *<S {Elb}.> He must before the Deputy Sir, he ha's giuen
1524  *him warning: the Deputy cannot abide a Whore- ma-ster:
1525  *if he be a Whore- monger, and comes before him,
1526   he were as good go a mile on his errand.
1527  *<S {Duke}.> That we were all, as some would seeme to bee
1528   From our faults, as faults from seeming free.
1529   <D {Enter Lucio}.>
1530   <S {Elb}.> His necke will come to your #wast, a Cord sir.
1531  *<S {Clo}.> I spy comfort, I cry baile: Here's a Gentleman,
1532   and a friend of mine.
1533  *<S {Luc}.> How now noble {Pompey}? What, at the wheels
1534  *of {Caesar}? Art thou led in triumph? What is there none
1535  *of {Pigmalions} Images newly made woman to bee had
1536  *now, for putting the hand in the pocket, and extracting
1537  *clutch'd? What reply? Ha? What saist thou to this
1538  *Tune, Matter, and Method? Is't not drown'd i'th last
1539  *raine? Ha? What saist thou Trot? Is the world as it was
1540  *Man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words?
1541   Or how? The tricke of it?
1542   <S {Duke}.> Still thus, and thus: still worse?
1543  *<S {Luc}.> How doth my deere Morsell, thy Mistris? Pro-cures
1544   she still? Ha?
1545  *<S {Clo}.> Troth sir, shee hath eaten vp all her beefe, and
1546   she is her selfe in the tub.
1547  *<S {Luc}.> Why 'tis good: It is the right of it: it must be
1548  *so. Euer your fresh Whore, and your pouder'd Baud, an
1549  *vnshun'd consequence, it must be so. Art going to pri-son
1550   {Pompey}?
1551   <S {Clo}.> Yes faith sir.
1552  *<S {Luc}.> Why 'tis not amisse {Pompey}: farewell: goe say
1553   I sent thee thether: for debt {Pompey}? Or how?
1554   <S {Elb}.> For being a baud, for being a baud.
1555  *<S {Luc}.> Well, then imprison him: If imprisonment be
1556  *the due of a baud, why 'tis his right. Baud is he doubt-lesse,
1557  *and of antiquity too: Baud borne. Farwell good
1558  *{Pompey}: Commend me to the prison {Pompey}, you will
1559  *turne good husband now {Pompey}, you will keepe the
1560   house.
1561  *<S {Clo}.> I hope Sir, your good Worship wil be my baile?
1562  *<S {Luc}.> No indeed wil I not {Pompey}, it is not the wear:
1563  *I will pray ({Pompey}) to encrease your bondage if you
1564  *take it not patiently: Why, your mettle is the more:
1565   Adieu trustie {Pompey}.
1566   Blesse you Friar.
1567   <S {Duke}.> And you.
1568   <S {Luc}.> Do's {Bridget} paint still, {Pompey}? Ha?
1569   <S {Elb}.> Come your waies sir, come.
      <C C>
1570   <S {Clo}.> You will not baile me then Sir?
1571  *<S {Luc}.> Then {Pompey}, nor now: what newes abroad {Fri-er}?
1572   What newes?
1573   <S {Elb}.> Come your waies sir, come.
1574   <S {Luc}.> Goe to kennell ({Pompey}) goe:
1575   What newes {Frier} of the Duke?
1576   <S {Duke}.> I know none: can you tell me of any?
1577  *<S {Luc}.> Some say he is with the Emperor of {Russia}: other
1578   some,  he is in {Rome}: but where is he thinke you?
1579  *<S {Duke}.> I know not where: but wheresoeuer, I wish
1580   him well.
1581  *<S {Luc}.> It was a mad fantasticall tricke of him to steale
1582  *from the State, and vsurpe the beggerie hee was neuer
1583  *borne to: Lord {Angelo} Dukes it well in his absence: he
1584   puts transgression too't.
1585   <S {Duke}.> He do's well in't.
1586  *<S {Luc}.> A little more lenitie to Lecherie would doe no
1587   harme in him: Something too crabbed that way, {Frier}.
1588  *<S {Duk}.> It is too general a vice, and seueritie must cure it.
1589  *<S {Luc}.> Yes in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
1590  *it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirpe it quite,
1591  *Frier, till eating and drinking be put downe. They say
1592  *this {Angelo} was not made by Man and Woman, after
      <C T>
1593  *this downe- right way of Creation: is it true, thinke
1594   you?
1595   <S {Duke}.> How should he be made then?
1596  *<S {Luc}.> Some report, a Sea- maid spawn'd him. Some,
1597  *that he was begot betweene two Stock- fishes. But it
1598  *is certaine, that when he makes water, his Vrine is con-geal'd
1599  *ice, that I know to bee true: and he is a motion
1600   generatiue, that's infallible.
1601   <S {Duke}.> You are pleasant sir, and speake apace.
1602  *<S {Luc}.> Why, what a ruthlesse thing is this in him, for
1603  *the rebellion of a Cod- peece, to take away the life of a
1604  *man? Would the Duke that is absent haue done this?
1605  *Ere he would haue hang'd a man for the getting a hun-dred
1606  *Bastards, he would haue paide for the Nursing a
1607  *thousand. He had some feeling of the sport, hee knew
1608   the seruice, and that instructed him to mercie.
1609  *<S {Duke}.> I neuer heard the absent Duke much detected
      <C B>
1610   for Women, he was not enclin'd that way.
1611   <S {Luc}.> Oh Sir, you are deceiu'd.
1612   <S {Duke}.> 'Tis not possible.
1613  *<S {Luc}.> Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty:
1614  *and his vse was, to put a ducket in her Clack- dish; the
1615  *Duke had Crochets in him. Hee would be drunke too,
1616   that let me informe you.
1617   <S {Duke}.> You do him wrong, surely.
1618  *<S {Luc}.> Sir, I was an inward of his: a shie fellow was
1619  *the Duke, and I beleeue I know the cause of his with-drawing.
1620  _
1621   <S {Duke}.> What (I prethee) might be the cause?
1622  *<S {Luc}.> No, pardon: 'Tis a secret must bee lockt with-in
1623  *the teeth and the lippes: but this I can let you vnder-stand,
1624  *the greater file of the subiect held the Duke to be
1625   wise.
1626   <S {Duke}.> Wise? Why no question but he was.
1627  *<S {Luc}.> A very superficiall, ignorant, vnweighing fellow
1628  *<S {Duke}.> Either this is Enuie in you, Folly, or mista-king:
1629  *The very streame of his life, and the businesse he
1630  *hath helmed, must vppon a warranted neede, giue him
1631  *a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in
1632  *his owne bringings forth, and hee shall appeare to the
1633  *enuious, a Scholler, a Statesman, and a Soldier: there-fore
1634  *you speake vnskilfully: or, if your knowledge bee
1635   more, it is much darkned in your malice.
      <P G1v>
1636   <S {Luc}.> Sir, I know him, and I loue him.
1637  *<S {Duke}.> Loue talkes with better knowledge, & know-ledge
1638   with deare loue.
1639   <S {Luc}.> Come Sir, I know what I know.
1640  *<S {Duke}.> I can hardly beleeue that, since you know not
1641  *what you speake. But if euer the Duke returne (as our
1642  *praiers are he may) let mee desire you to make your an-swer
1643  *before him: if it bee honest you haue spoke, you
1644  *haue courage to maintaine it; I am bound to call vppon
1645   you, and I pray you your name?
1646  *<S {Luc}.> Sir my name is {Lucio}, wel known to the Duke.
1647  *<S {Duke}.> He shall know you better Sir, if I may liue to
1648   report you.
1649   <S {Luc}.> I feare you not.
1650  *<S {Duke}.> O, you hope the Duke will returne no more:
1651  *or you imagine me #to vnhurtfull an opposite: but indeed
1652  *I can doe you little harme: You'll for- sweare this a-gaine?
1653  _
1654  *<S {Luc}.> Ile be hang'd first: Thou art deceiu'd in mee
1655  *Friar. But no more of this: Canst thou tell if {Claudio}
1656   die to morrow, or no?
1657   <S {Duke}.> Why should he die Sir?
1658  *<S {Luc}.> Why? For filling a bottle with a Tunne- dish:
1659  *I would the Duke we talke of were return'd againe: this
1660  *vngenitur'd Agent will vn- people the Prouince with
1661  *Continencie. Sparrowes must not build in his house- eeues,
1662  *because they are lecherous: The Duke yet would
1663  *haue darke deeds darkelie answered, hee would neuer
1664  *bring them to light: would hee were return'd. Marrie
1665  *this {Claudio} is condemned for vntrussing. Farwell good
1666  *Friar, I prethee pray for me: The Duke (I say to thee
1667  *againe) would eate Mutton on Fridaies. He's now past
1668  *it, yet (and I say to thee) hee would mouth with a beg-gar,
1669  *though she smelt browne- bread and Garlicke: say
1670   that I said so: Farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
1671   <S {Duke}.> No #might, nor greatnesse in mortality
1672   Can censure scape: Back- wounding calumnie
1673   The whitest vertue strikes. What King so strong,
1674   Can tie the gall vp in the slanderous tong?
1675   But who comes heere?
1676   <D {Enter Escalus, Prouost, and Bawd}.>
1677   <S {Esc}.> Go, away with her to prison.
1678  *<S {Bawd}.> Good my Lord be good to mee, your Honor
1679   is accounted a mercifull man: good my Lord.
1680  *<S {Esc}.> Double, and trebble admonition, and still for-feite
1681  *in the same kinde? This would make mercy sweare
1682   and play the Tirant.
1683  *<S {Pro}.> A Bawd of eleuen yeares continuance, may it
1684   please your Honor.
1685  *<S {Bawd}.> My Lord, this is one {Lucio's} information a-gainst
1686  *me, Mistris {Kate Keepe- downe} was with childe by
1687  *him in the Dukes time, he promis'd her marriage: his
1688  *Childe is a yeere and a quarter olde come {Philip} and {Ia-cob}:
1689  *I haue kept it my selfe; and see how hee goes about
1690   to abuse me.
1691  *<S {Esc}.> That fellow is a fellow of much License: Let
1692  *him be call'd before vs, Away with her to prison: Goe
1693  *#too, no more words. Prouost, my Brother {Angelo} will
1694  *not be alter'd, {Claudio} must die to morrow: Let him be
1695  *furnish'd with Diuines, and haue all charitable prepara-tion.
1696  *If my brother wrought by my pitie, it should not
1697   be so with him.
1698  *<S {Pro}.> So please you, this Friar hath beene with him,
1699   and aduis'd him for th' entertainment of death.
1700   <S {Esc}.> Good' euen, good Father.
1701   <S {Duke}.> Blisse, and goodnesse on you.
1702   <S {Esc}.> Of whence are you?
1703  *<S {Duke}.> Not of this Countrie, though my chance is now
1704   To vse it for my time: I am a brother
1705   Of gracious Order, late come from the Sea,
1706   In speciall businesse from his Holinesse.
1707   <S {Esc}.> What newes abroad i'th World?
1708  *<S {Duke}.> None, but that there  is so great a Feauor on
1709  *goodnesse, that the dissolution of it must cure it. No-ueltie
1710  *is onely in request, and as it is as dangerous to be
1711  *aged in any kinde of course, as it is vertuous to be con-stant
1712  *in any vndertaking. There is scarse truth enough
1713  *aliue to make Societies secure, but Securitie enough to
1714  *make Fellowships accurst: Much vpon this riddle runs
1715  *the wisedome of the world: This newes is old enough,
1716  *yet it is euerie daies newes. I pray you Sir, of what dis-position
1717   was the Duke?
1718   <S {Esc}.> One, that aboue all other strifes,
1719   Contended especially to know himselfe.
1720   <S {Duke}.> What pleasure was he giuen to?
1721  *<S {Esc}.> Rather reioycing to see another merry, then
1722  *merrie at anie thing which profest to make him reioice.
1723  *A Gentleman of all temperance. But leaue wee him to
1724  *his euents, with a praier they may proue prosperous, &
1725  *let me desire to know, how you finde {Claudio} prepar'd?
1726  *I am made to vnderstand, that you haue lent him visita-tion.
1727  _
1728  *<S {Duke}.> He professes to haue receiued no sinister mea-sure
1729  *from his Iudge, but most willingly humbles him-selfe
1730  *to the determination of Iustice: yet had he framed
1731  *to himselfe (by the instruction of his frailty) manie de-ceyuing
1732  *promises of life, which I (by my good leisure)
1733   haue discredited to him, and now is he resolu'd to die.
1734  *<S {Esc}.> You haue paid the heauens your Function, and
1735  *the prisoner the verie debt of your Calling. I haue la-bour'd
1736  *for the poore Gentleman, to the extremest shore
1737  *of my modestie, but my brother- Iustice haue I found so
1738  *seuere, that he hath forc'd me to tell him, hee is indeede
1739   Iustice.
1740   <S {Duke}.> If his owne life,
1741   Answere the straitnesse of his proceeding,
1742  *It shall become him well: wherein if he chance to faile
1743   he hath sentenc'd himselfe.
1744  *<S {Esc}> I am going to visit the prisoner, Fare you well.
1745   <S {Duke}.> Peace be with you.
1746   He who the sword of Heauen will beare,
1747   Should be as holy, as seueare:
1748   Patterne in himselfe to know,
1749   Grace to stand, and Vertue go:
1750   More, nor lesse to others paying,
1751   Then by selfe- offences weighing.
1752   Shame to him, whose cruell striking,
1753   Kils for faults of his owne liking:
1754   Twice trebble shame on {Angelo},
1755   To weede my vice, and let his grow.
1756   Oh, what may Man within him hide,
1757   Though Angel on the outward side?
1758   How may likenesse made in crimes,
1759   Making practise on the Times,
1760   To draw with ydle Spiders strings
1761   Most ponderous and substantiall things?
1762   Craft against vice, I must applie.
1763   With {Angelo} to night shall lye
1764   His old betroathed (but  despised:)
1765   So disguise shall by th' disguised
1766   Pay with falshood, false exacting,
1767   And performe an olde contracting.  <D {Exit}>

1776   <D {Enter Duke}.>
1777  *<S {Mar}.> Breake off thy song, and haste thee quick away,
1778   Here comes a man of comfort, whose aduice
1779   Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
1780   I cry you mercie, Sir, and well could wish
1781   You had not found me here so musicall.
1782   Let me excuse me, and beleeue me so,
1783   My mirth it much displeas'd, but pleas'd my woe.
1784  *<S {Duk}.> 'Tis good; though Musick oft hath such a charme
1785   To make bad, good; and good prouoake to harme.
1786  *I pray you tell me, hath any body enquir'd for mee here
1787  *to day; much vpon this time haue I promis'd here to
1788   meete.
1789  *<S {Mar}.> You haue not bin enquir'd after: I haue sat
1790   here all day.
1791   <D {Enter Isabell}.>
1792  *<S {Duk}.> I doe constantly beleeue you: the time is come
1793  *euen now. I shall craue your forbearance a little, may be
1794  *I will call vpon you anone for some aduantage to your
1795   selfe.
1796   <S {Mar}.> I am alwayes bound to you.  <D {Exit}.>
1797   <S {Duk}.> Very well met, and well come:
1798   What is the newes from this good Deputie?
1799   <S {Isab}.> He hath a Garden circummur'd with Bricke,
1800   Whose westerne side is with a Vineyard back't;
1801   And to that Vineyard is a planched gate,
1802   That makes his opening with this bigger Key:
1803   This other doth command a little doore,
1804   Which from the Vineyard to the Garden leades,
1805   There haue I made my promise, vpon the
1806   Heauy midle of the night, to call vpon him.
1807  *<S {Duk}.> But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
1808   <S {Isab}.> I haue t'ane a due, and wary note vpon't,
1809   With whispering, and most guiltie diligence,
1810   In action all of precept, he did show me
1811   The way twice ore.
1812   <S {Duk}.> Are there no other tokens
1813   Betweene you 'greed, concerning her obseruance?
1814   <S {Isab}.> No: none but onely a repaire ith' darke,
1815   #And that I haue possest him, my most stay
1816   Can be but briefe: for I haue made him know,
1817   I haue a Seruant comes with me along
1818   That staies vpon me; whose perswasion is,
1819   I come about my Brother.
1820   <S {Duk}.> 'Tis well borne vp.
1821   I haue not yet made knowne to {Mariana}
1822   <D {Enter Mariana}.>
1823   A word of this: what hoa, within; come forth,
1824   I pray you be acquainted with this Maid,
1825   She comes to doe you good.
1826   <S {Isab}.> I doe desire the like.
1827   <S {Duk}.> Do you perswade your selfe that I respect you?
      <C C>
1828  *<S {Mar}.> Good Frier, I know you do, and haue found it.
1829   <S {Duke}.> Take then this your companion by the hand
1830   Who hath a storie readie for your eare:
1831   I shall attend your leisure, but make haste
1832   The vaporous night approaches.
1833   <S {Mar}.> #Wilt please you walke aside.  <D {Exit}.>
1834   <S {Duke}.> Oh Place, and greatnes: millions of false eies
1835   Are stucke vpon thee: volumes of report
1836   Run with these false, and most contrarious Quest
1837   Vpon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
1838   Make thee the father of their idle dreame,
1839  *And racke thee in their fancies. Welcome, how agreed?
1840   <D {Enter Mariana and Isabella}.>
1841   <S {Isab}.> Shee'll take the enterprize vpon her father,
1842   If you aduise it.
1843   <S {Duke}.> It is not my consent,
1844   But my entreaty too.
1845   <S {Isa}.> Little haue you to say
1846   When you depart from him, but soft and low,
1847   Remember now my brother.
1848   <S {Mar}.> Feare me not.
1849   <S {Duk}.> Nor gentle daughter, feare you not at all:
1850   He is your husband on a pre- contract:
1851   To bring you thus together 'tis no sinne,
1852   Sith that the Iustice of your title to him
1853   Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let vs goe,
1854  *Our Corne's to reape, for yet our Tithes to sow.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1855   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1856   <D {Enter Prouost and Clowne}.>
1857  *<S {Pro}.> Come hither sirha; can you cut off a mans head?
1858   <S {Clo}.> If the man be a Bachelor Sir, I can:
1859   But if he be a married man, he's his wiues head,
1860   And I can neuer cut off a womans head.
1861  *<S {Pro}.> Come sir, leaue me your snatches, and yeeld mee
1862  *a direct answere. To morrow morning are to die {Clau-dio}
1863  *and {Barnardine}: heere is in our prison a common exe-cutioner,
1864  *who in his office lacks a helper, if you will take
1865  *it on you to assist him, it shall redeeme you from your
1866  *Gyues: if not, you shall  haue your full time of imprison-ment,
1867  *and your deliuerance with an vnpittied whipping;
1868   for you haue beene a notorious bawd.
1869  *<S {Clo}.> Sir, I haue beene an vnlawfull bawd, time out of
1870  *minde, but yet I will bee content to be a lawfull hang-man:
1871  *I would bee glad to receiue some instruction from
1872   my fellow partner.
1873   <S {Pro}.> What hoa, {Abhorson}: where's {Abhorson} there?
1874   <D {Enter Abhorson}.>
1875   <S {Abh}.> Doe you call sir?
1876  *<S {Pro}.> Sirha, here's a fellow will helpe you to morrow
1877  *in your execution: if you thinke it meet, compound with
1878  *him by the yeere, and let him abide here with you, if not,
1879  *vse him for the present, and dismisse him, hee cannot
1880   plead his estimation with you: he hath beene a Bawd.
1881  *<S {Abh}.> A Bawd Sir? fie vpon him, he will discredit our
1882   mysterie.
1883  *<S {Pro}.> Goe #too Sir, you waigh equallie: a feather will
1884   turne the Scale.  <D {Exit}.>
1885  *<S {Clo}.> Pray sir, by your good fauor: for surely sir, a
1886  *good fauor you haue, but that you haue a hanging look:
1887   Doe you call sir, your occupation a Mysterie?
      <P G2v><C B>
1888   <S {Abh}.> #I Sir, a Misterie.
1889  *<S {Clo}.> Painting Sir, I haue heard say, is a Misterie; and
1890  *your Whores sir, being members of my occupation, v-sing
1891  *painting, do proue my Occupation, a Misterie: but
1892  *what Misterie there should be in hanging, if I should
1893   be hang'd, I cannot imagine.
1894   <S {Abh}.> Sir, it is a Misterie.
1895   <S {Clo}.> Proofe.
1896   <S {Abh}.> Euerie true mans apparrell fits your Theefe.
1897  *<S {Clo}.> If it be too little for your theefe, your true man
1898  *thinkes it bigge enough. If it bee too bigge for your
1899  *Theefe, your Theefe thinkes it little enough: So euerie
1900   true mans apparrell fits your Theefe.
1901   <D {Enter Prouost}.>
1902   <S {Pro}.> Are you agreed?
1903  *<S {Clo}.> Sir, I will serue him: For I do finde your Hang-man
1904  *is a more penitent Trade then your Bawd: he doth
1905   oftner aske forgiuenesse.
1906  *<S {Pro}.> You sirrah, prouide your blocke and your Axe
1907   to morrow, foure #a clocke.
1908  *<S {Abh}.> Come on (Bawd) I will instruct thee in my
1909   Trade: follow.
1910  *<S {Clo}.> I do desire to learne sir: and I hope, if you haue
1911  *occasion to vse me for your owne turne, you shall finde
1912  *me y'are. For truly sir, for your kindnesse, I owe you a
1913   good turne.  <D {Exit}>
1914   <S {Pro}.> Call hether {Barnardine} and {Claudio}:
1915   Th' one  has my pitie; not a iot the other,
1916   Being a Murtherer, though he were my brother.
1917   <D {Enter Claudio}.>
1918   Looke, here's the Warrant {Claudio}, for thy death,
1919   'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to morrow
1920   Thou must be made immortall. Where's {Barnardine}?
1921   <S {Cla}.> As fast lock'd vp in sleepe, as guiltlesse labour,
1922   When it lies starkely in the Trauellers bones,
1923   He will not wake.
1924   <S {Pro}.> Who can do good on him?
1925   Well, go, prepare your selfe. But harke, what noise?
1926   Heauen giue your spirits comfort: #by, and by,
1927   I hope it is some pardon, or repreeue
1928   For the most gentle {Claudio}. Welcome Father.
1929   <D {Enter Duke}.>
1930  *<S {Duke}.> The best, and wholsomst spirits of the night,
1931   Inuellop you, good Prouost: who call'd heere of late?
1932   <S {Pro}.> None since the Curphew rung.
1933   <S {Duke}.> Not {Isabell}?
1934   <S {Pro}.> No.
1935   <S {Duke}.> They will then er't be long.
1936   <S {Pro}.> What comfort is for {Claudio}?
1937   <S {Duke}.> There's some in hope.
1938   <S {Pro}.> It is a bitter Deputie.
1939   <S {Duke}.> Not so, not so: his life is paralel'd
1940   Euen with the stroke and line of his great Iustice:
1941   He doth with holie abstinence subdue
1942   That in himselfe, which he spurres on his powre
1943   To qualifie in others: were he meal'd with that
1944   Which he corrects, then were he tirrannous,
1945   But this being so, he's iust. Now are they come.
1946   This is a gentle Prouost, sildome when
1947   The steeled Gaoler is the friend of men:
1948   How now? what noise? That spirit's possest with #hast,
1949   That wounds th' vnsisting  Posterne with these strokes.
1950   <S {Pro}.> There he must stay vntil the Officer
1951   Arise to let him in: he is call'd vp.
1952   <S {Duke}.> Haue you no countermand for {Claudio} yet?
1953   But he must die to morrow?
1954   <S {Pro}.> None Sir, none.
1955   <S {Duke}.> As neere the dawning Prouost, as it is,
1956   You shall heare more ere Morning.
1957   <S {Pro}.> Happely
1958   You something know: yet I beleeue there comes
1959   No countermand: no such example haue we:
1960   Besides, vpon the verie siege of Iustice,
1961   Lord {Angelo} hath to the publike eare
1962   Profest the contrarie.
1963   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1964   <S {Duke}.> This is his Lords man.
1965   <S {Pro}.> And heere comes {Claudio's} pardon.
1966   <S {Mess}.> My Lord hath sent you this note,
1967   And by mee this further charge;
1968   That you swerue not from the smallest Article of it,
1969   Neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.
1970   Good morrow: for as I take it, it is almost day.
1971   <S {Pro}.> I shall obey him.
1972   <S {Duke}.> This is his Pardon purchas'd by such sin,
1973   For which the Pardoner himselfe is in:
1974   Hence hath offence his quicke celeritie,
1975   When it is borne in high Authority.
1976   When Vice makes Mercie; Mercie's so extended,
1977   That for the faults loue, is th' offender friended.
1978   Now Sir, what newes?
1979   <S {Pro}.> I told you:
1980   Lord {Angelo} (be- like) thinking me remisse
1981   In mine Office, awakens mee
1982   With this vnwonted putting on, methinks strangely:
1983   For he hath not vs'd it before.
1984   <S {Duk}.> Pray you let's heare.
1985   <D {The Letter}.>
1986  *{Whatsoeuer you may heare to the contrary, let Claudio be ex-ecuted}
1987  *{by foure of the clocke, and in the afternoone Bernar-dine:}
1988  *{For my better satisfaction, let mee haue Claudios}
1989  *{head sent me by fiue. Let this be duely performed with a}
1990  *{thought that more depends on it, then we must yet deliuer}.
1991  *{Thus faile not to doe your Office, as you will answere it at}
1992   {your perill}.
1993   What say you to this Sir?
1994  *<S {Duke}.> What is that {Barnardine}, who is to be execu-ted
1995   in th' afternoone?
1996  *<S {Pro}.> A Bohemian borne: But here nurst vp & bred,
1997   One that is a prisoner nine yeeres old.
1998  *<S {Duke}.> How came it, that the absent Duke had not
1999  *either deliuer'd him to his libertie, or executed him? I
2000   haue heard it was euer his manner to do so.
2001   <S {Pro}.> His friends still wrought Repreeues for him:
2002  *And indeed his fact till now in the gouernment of Lord
2003   {Angelo}, came not to an vndoubtfull proofe.
2004   <S {Duke}.> It is now apparant?
2005   <S {Pro}.> Most manifest, and not denied by himselfe.
2006  *<S {Duke}.> Hath he borne himselfe penitently in prison?
2007   How seemes he to be touch'd?
2008  *<S {Pro}.> A man that apprehends death no more dread-fully,
2009  *but as a drunken sleepe, carelesse, wreaklesse, and
2010  *fearelesse of what's past, present, or to come: insensible
2011   of mortality, and desperately mortall.
2012   <S {Duke}.> He wants aduice.
2013  *<S {Pro}.> He wil heare none: he hath euermore had the li-berty
2014  *of the prison: giue him leaue to escape hence, hee
2015  *would not. Drunke many times a day, if not many daies
2016  *entirely drunke. We haue verie oft awak'd him, as if to
2017  *carrie him to execution, and shew'd him a seeming war-rant
2018   for it, it hath not moued him at all.
      <P G3>
2019  *<S {Duke}.> More of him anon: There is written in your
2020  *brow Prouost, honesty and constancie; if I reade it not
2021  *truly, my ancient skill beguiles me: but in the boldnes
2022  *of my cunning, I will lay my selfe in hazard: {Claudio},
2023  *whom heere you haue warrant to execute, is no greater
2024  *forfeit to the Law, then {Angelo} who hath sentenc'd him.
2025  *To make you vnderstand this in a manifested effect, I
2026  *craue but foure daies respit: for the which, you are to
2027   do me both a present, and a dangerous courtesie.
2028   <S {Pro}.> Pray Sir, in what?
2029   <S {Duke}.> In the delaying death.
2030  *<S {Pro}.> Alacke, how may I do it? Hauing the houre li-mited,
2031  *and an expresse command, vnder penaltie, to de-liuer
2032  *his head in the view of {Angelo}? I may make my
2033   case as {Claudio's}, to crosse this in the smallest.
2034   <S {Duke}.> By the vow of mine Order, I warrant you,
2035   If my instructions may be your guide,
2036   Let this {Barnardine} be this morning executed,
2037   And his head borne to {Angelo}.
2038   <S {Pro}.> {Angelo} hath seene them both,
2039   And will discouer the fauour.
2040  *<S {Duke}.> Oh, death's a great disguiser, and you may
2041  *adde to it; Shaue the head, and tie the beard, and say it
2042  *was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'de before his
2043  *death: you know the course is common. If any thing
2044  *fall to you vpon this, more then thankes and good for-tune,
2045  *by the Saint whom I professe, I will plead against
2046   it with my life.
2047  *<S {Pro}.> Pardon me, good Father, it is against my oath.
2048  *<S {Duke}.> Were you sworne to the Duke, or to the De-putie?
2049  _
2050   <S {Pro}.> To him, and to his Substitutes.
2051  *<S {Duke}.> You will thinke you haue made no offence, if
2052   the Duke auouch the iustice of your dealing?
2053   <S {Pro}.> But what likelihood is in that?
2054  *<S {Duke}.> Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet since
2055  *I see you fearfull, that neither my coate, integrity, nor
2056  *perswasion, can with ease attempt you, I wil go further
2057  *then I meant, to plucke all feares out of you. Looke
2058  *you Sir, heere is the hand and Seale of the Duke: you
2059  *know the Charracter I doubt not, and the Signet is not
2060   strange to you?
2061   <S {Pro}.> I know them both.
2062  *<S {Duke}.> The Contents of this, is the returne of the
2063  *Duke; you shall anon ouer- reade it at your pleasure:
2064  *where you shall finde within these two daies, he wil be
2065  *heere. This is a thing that {Angelo} knowes not, for hee
2066  *this very day receiues letters of strange tenor, perchance
2067  *of the Dukes death, perchance entering into some Mo-nasterie,
2068  *but by chance nothing of what is writ. Looke,
2069  *th' vnfolding  Starre calles vp the Shepheard; put not
2070  *your selfe into amazement, how these things should be;
2071  *all difficulties are but easie when they are knowne. Call
2072  *your executioner, and off with {Barnardines} head: I will
2073  *giue him a present shrift, and aduise him for a better
2074  *place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall absolutely re-solue
2075  *you: Come away, it is almost cleere dawne.  <D {Exit}.>
2076   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2077   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
2078  *<S {Clo}.> I am as well acquainted heere, as I was in our
2079  *house of profession: one would thinke it were Mistris
2080  *{Ouer-dons} owne house, for heere be manie of her olde
2081  *Customers. First, here's yong Mr {Rash}, hee's in for a
2082  *commoditie of browne paper, and olde Ginger, nine
2083  *score and seuenteene pounds, of which hee made fiue
2084  *Markes readie money: marrie then, Ginger was not
2085  *much in request, for the olde Women were all dead.
2086  *Then is there heere one Mr  {Caper}, at the suite of Master
2087  *{Three- Pile} the Mercer, for some foure suites of Peach-colour'd
2088  *Satten, which now peaches him a beggar.
2089  *Then haue we heere, yong {Dizie}, and yong Mr  {Deepe-vow},
2090  *and Mr  {Copperspurre}, and Mr  {Starue- Lackey} the Ra-pier
2091  *and dagger man, and yong {Drop- heire} that kild lu-stie
2092  *{Pudding}, and Mr  {Forthlight} the Tilter, and braue Mr
2093  *{Shootie} the great Traueller, and wilde {Halfe- Canne} that
2094  *stabb'd Pots, and I thinke fortie more, all great doers in
2095   our Trade, and are now for the Lords sake.
2096   <D {Enter Abhorson}.>
2097   <S {Abh}.> Sirrah, bring {Barnardine} hether.
2098   <S {Clo}.> Mr  {Barnardine}, you must rise and be hang'd,
2099   Mr  {Barnardine}.
2100   <S {Abh}.> What hoa {Barnardine}.
2101   <D {Barnardine within}.>
2102  *<S {Bar}.> A pox o'your throats: who makes that noyse
2103   there? What are you?
2104   <S {Clo}.> Your friends Sir, the Hangman:
2105   You must be so good Sir to rise, and be put to death.
2106   <S {Bar}.> Away you Rogue, away, I am sleepie.
2107   <S {Abh}.> Tell him he must awake,
2108   And that quickly too.
2109  *<S {Clo}.> Pray Master {Barnardine}, awake till you are ex-ecuted,
2110   and sleepe afterwards.
2111   <S {Ab}.> Go in to him, and fetch him out.
2112  *<S {Clo}.> He is comming Sir, he is comming: I heare his
2113   Straw russle.
2114   <D {Enter Barnardine}.>
2115   <S {Abh}.> Is the Axe vpon the blocke, sirrah?
2116   <S {Clo}.> Verie readie Sir.
2117   <S {Bar}.> How now {Abhorson}?
2118   What's the newes with you?
2119  *<S {Abh}.> Truly Sir, I would desire you to clap into your
2120   prayers: for looke you, the Warrants come.
2121   <S {Bar}.> You Rogue, I haue bin drinking all night,
2122   I am not fitted for't.
2123  *<S {Clo}.> Oh, the better Sir: for he that drinkes all night,
2124  *and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleepe the
2125   sounder all the next day.
2126   <D {Enter Duke}.>
2127  *<S {Abh}.> Looke you Sir, heere comes your ghostly Fa-ther:
2128   do we iest now thinke you?
2129  *<S {Duke}.> Sir, induced by my charitie, and hearing how
2130   hastily you are to depart, I am come to aduise you,
2131   Comfort you, and pray with you.
2132  *<S {Bar}.> Friar, not I: I haue bin drinking hard all night,
2133  *and I will haue more time to prepare mee, or they shall
2134  *beat out my braines with billets: I will not consent to
2135   die this day, that's certaine.
2136  *<S {Duke}.> Oh sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
2137   Looke forward on the iournie you shall go.
2138  *<S {Bar}.> I sweare I will not die to day for anie mans per-swasion.
2139  _
2140   <S {Duke}.> But heare you:
2141  *<S {Bar}.> Not a word: if you haue anie thing to say to me,
2142   come to my Ward: for thence will not I to day.
2143   <D {Exit}>
2144   <D {Enter Prouost}.>
2145   <S {Duke}.> Vnfit to liue, or die: oh grauell heart.
      <P G3v>
2146   After him (Fellowes) bring him to the blocke.
2147   <S {Pro}.> Now Sir, how do you finde the prisoner?
2148   <S {Duke}.> A creature vnpre-par'd, vnmeet for death,
2149   And to transport him in the minde he is,
2150   Were damnable.
2151   <S {Pro}.> Heere in the prison, Father,
2152   There died this morning of a cruell Feauor,
2153   One {Ragozine}, a most notorious Pirate,
2154   A man of {Claudio's} yeares: his beard, and head
2155   Iust of his colour. What if we do omit
2156   This Reprobate, til he were wel enclin'd,
2157   And satisfie the Deputie with the visage
2158   Of {Ragozine}, more like to {Claudio}?
2159   <S {Duke}.> Oh, 'tis an accident that heauen prouides:
2160   Dispatch it presently, the houre drawes on
2161   Prefixt by {Angelo}: See this be done,
2162   And sent according to command, whiles I
2163   Perswade this rude wretch willingly to die.
2164   <S {Pro}.> This shall be done (good Father) presently:
2165   But {Barnardine} must die this afternoone,
2166   And how shall we continue {Claudio},
2167   To saue me from the danger that might come,
2168   If he were knowne aliue?
2169   <S {Duke}.> Let this be done,
2170   Put them in secret holds, both {Barnardine} and {Claudio},
2171   Ere twice the Sun hath made his iournall greeting
2172   To yond generation, you shal finde
2173   Your safetie manifested.
2174   <S {Pro}.> I am your free dependant.  <D {Exit}.>
2175  *<S {Duke}.> Quicke, dispatch, and send the head to {Angelo}
2176   Now wil I write Letters to {Angelo},
2177   (The Prouost he shal beare them) whose contents
2178   Shal witnesse to him I am neere at home:
2179   And that by great Iniunctions I am bound
2180   To enter publikely: him Ile desire
2181   To meet me at the consecrated Fount,
2182   A League below the Citie: and from thence,
2183   By cold gradation, and weale- ballanc'd forme.
2184   We shal proceed with {Angelo}.
2185   <D {Enter Prouost}.>
2186   <S {Pro}.> Heere is the head, Ile carrie it my selfe.
2187   <S {Duke}.> Conuenient is it: Make a swift returne,
2188   For I would commune with you of such things,
2189   That want no eare but yours.
2190   <S {Pro}.> Ile make all speede.  <D {Exit}>
2191   <D {Isabell within}.>
2192   <S {Isa}.> Peace hoa, be heere.
2193   <S {Duke}.> The tongue of {Isabell}. She's come to know,
2194   If yet her brothers pardon be come hither:
2195   But I will keepe her ignorant of her good,
2196   To make her heauenly comforts of dispaire,
2197   When it is least expected.
2198   <D {Enter Isabella}.>
2199   <S {Isa}.> Hoa, by your leaue.
2200   <S {Duke}.> Good morning to you, faire, and gracious
2201   daughter.
2202   <S {Isa}.> The better giuen me by so holy a man,
2203   Hath yet the Deputie sent my brothers pardon?
2204   <S {Duke}.> He hath releasd him, {Isabell}, from the world,
2205   His head is off, and sent to {Angelo}.
2206   <S {Isa}.> Nay, but it is not so.
2207   <S {Duke}.> It is no other,
2208   Shew your wisedome daughter in your close patience.
2209   <S {Isa}.> Oh, I wil to him, and plucke out his eies.
2210   <S {Duk}.> You shal not be admitted to his sight.
2211   <S {Isa}.> Vnhappie {Claudio}, wretched {Isabell},
2212   Iniurious world, most damned {Angelo}.
2213   <S {Duke}.> This nor hurts him, nor profits you a iot,
2214   Forbeare it therefore, giue your cause to heauen.
2215   Marke what I say, which you shal finde
2216   By euery sillable a faithful veritie.
2217   The Duke comes home to morrow: nay drie your eyes,
2218   One of our Couent, and his Confessor
2219   Giues me this instance: Already he hath carried
2220   Notice to {Escalus} and {Angelo},
2221   Who do prepare to meete him at the gates,
2222  *There to giue vp their powre: If you can pace your wis-|(dome,
2223   In that good path that I would wish it go,
2224   And you shal haue your bosome on this wretch,
2225   Grace of the Duke, reuenges to your heart,
2226   And general Honor.
2227   <S {Isa}.> I am directed by you.
2228   <S {Duk}.> This Letter then to Friar {Peter} giue,
2229   'Tis that he sent me of the Dukes returne:
2230   Say, by this token, I desire his companie
2231   At {Mariana's} house to night. Her cause, and yours
2232   Ile perfect  him withall, and he shal bring you
2233   Before the Duke; and to the head of {Angelo}
2234   Accuse him home and home. For my poore selfe,
2235   I am combined by a sacred Vow,
2236   And shall be absent. Wend you with this Letter:
2237   Command these fretting waters from your eies
2238   With a light heart; trust not my holie Order
2239   If I peruert your course: whose heere?
2240   <D {Enter Lucio}.>
2241   <S {Luc}.> Good' euen;
2242   Frier, where's the Prouost?
2243   <S {Duke}.> Not within Sir.
2244  *<S {Luc}.> Oh prettie {Isabella}, I am pale at mine heart, to
2245  *see thine eyes so red: thou must be  patient; I am faine
2246  *to dine and sup with water and bran: I dare not for my
2247  *head fill my belly. One fruitful Meale would set mee
2248  *too't: but they say the Duke will be heere to Morrow.
2249  *By my troth {Isabell} I lou'd thy brother, if the olde fan-tastical
2250  *Duke of darke corners had bene at home, he had
2251   liued.
2252  *<S {Duke}.> Sir, the Duke is marueilous little beholding
2253   to your reports, but the best is, he liues not in them.
2254  *<S {Luc}.> Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so wel as I
2255   do: he's a better woodman then thou tak'st him for.
2256  *<S {Duke}.> Well: you'l answer this one day. Fare ye well.
2257   <S {Luc}.> Nay tarrie, Ile go along with thee,
2258   I can tel thee pretty tales of the Duke.
2259  *<S {Duke}.> You haue told me too many of him already sir
2260   if they be true: if not true, none were enough.
2261  *<S {Lucio}.> I was once before him for getting a Wench
2262   with childe.
2263   <S {Duke}.> Did you such a thing?
2264  *<S {Luc}.> Yes marrie did I; but I was faine to forswear it,
2265  *They would else haue married me to the rotten Medler.
2266  *<S {Duke}.> Sir your company is fairer then honest, rest you
2267   well.
2268  *<S {Lucio}.> By my troth Ile go with thee to the lanes end:
2269  *if baudy talke offend you, wee'l haue very litle of it: nay
2270   Friar, I am a kind of Burre, I shal sticke.  <D {Exeunt}>
2271   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2272   <D {Enter Angelo & Escalus}.>
2273  *<S {Esc}.> Euery Letter he hath writ, hath disuouch'd other.
      <P G4><C C>
2274  *<S {An}.> In most vneuen and distracted manner, his actions
2275  *show much like to madnesse, pray heauen his wisedome
2276  *bee not tainted: and why meet him at the gates and de-liuer
2277   our authorities there?
2278   <S {Esc}.> I ghesse not.
2279  *<S {Ang}.> And why should wee proclaime it in an howre
2280  *before his entring, that if any craue redresse of iniustice,
2281   they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
2282  *<S {Esc}.> He showes his reason for that: to haue a dispatch
2283  *of Complaints, and to deliuer vs from deuices heere-after,
2284  *which shall then haue no power to stand against
2285   vs.
2286  *<S {Ang}.> Well: I beseech you let it bee proclaim'd be-times
2287  *i'th' morne, Ile call you at your house: giue notice
2288   to such men of sort and suite as are to meete him.
2289   <S {Esc}.> I shall sir: fareyouwell.  <D {Exit}.>
2290   <S {Ang}.> Good night.
2291   This deede vnshapes me quite, makes me vnpregnant
2292   And dull to all proceedings. A deflowred maid,
2293   And by an eminent body, that enforc'd
2294   The Law against it? But that her tender shame
2295   Will not proclaime against her maiden losse,
2296   How might she tongue me? yet reason dares her no,
2297   For my Authority beares of a credent bulke,
2298   That no particular scandall once can touch
2299   But it confounds the breather. He should haue liu'd,
2300   Saue that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
2301   Might in the times to come haue ta'ne reuenge
2302   By so receiuing a dishonor'd life
2303   With ransome of such shame: would yet he had liued.
2304   Alack, when once our grace we haue forgot,
2305  *Nothing goes right, we would, and we would not.  <D {Exit}.>
2306   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
2307   <D {Enter Duke and Frier Peter}.>
2308   <S {Duke}.> These Letters at fit time deliuer me,
2309   The Prouost knowes our purpose and our plot,
2310   The matter being #a foote, keepe your instruction
2311   And hold you euer to our speciall drift,
2312   Though sometimes you doe blench from this to that
2313   As cause doth minister: Goe call at {Flauia's} house,
2314   And tell him where I stay: giue the like notice
2315   To {Valencius}, {Rowland}, and to {Crassus},
2316   And bid them bring the Trumpets to the gate:
2317   But send me {Flauius} first.
2318   <S {Peter}.> It shall be speeded well.
2319   <D {Enter Varrius}.>
2320  *<S {Duke}.> I thank thee {Varrius}, thou hast made good #hast,
2321   Come, we will walke: There's other of our friends
2322   Will greet vs heere anon: my gentle {Varrius}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2323   <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
2324   <D {Enter Isabella and Mariana}.>
2325   <S {Isab}.> To speake so indirectly I am loath,
2326   I would say the truth, but to accuse him so
2327   That is your part, yet I am aduis'd to doe it,
2328   He saies, to vaile full purpose.
2329   <S {Mar}.> Be rul'd by him.
      <C D>
2330   <S {Isab}.> Besides he tells me, that if peraduenture
2331   He speake against me on the aduerse side,
2332   I should not thinke it strange, for 'tis a physicke
2333   That's bitter, to sweet end.
2334   <D {Enter Peter}.>
2335   <S {Mar}.> I would {Frier Peter}
2336   <S {Isab}.> Oh peace, the {Frier} is come.
2337   <S {Peter}.> Come I haue found you out a stand most fit,
2338   Where you may haue such vantage on the {Duke}
2339   He shall not passe you:
2340   Twice haue the Trumpets sounded.
2341   The generous, and grauest Citizens
2342   Haue hent the gates, and very neere vpon
2343   The {Duke} is entring:
2344   Therefore hence away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2345   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima}.>
2346   <D {Enter Duke, Varrius, Lords, Angelo, Esculus, Lucio},
2347   {Citizens at seuerall doores}.>
2348   <S {Duk}.> My very worthy Cosen, fairely met,
2349   Our old, and faithfull friend, we are glad to see you.
2350   <S {Ang}. {Esc}.>  Happy returne be to your royall grace.
2351   <S {Duk}.> Many and harty thankings to you both:
2352   We haue made enquiry of you, and we heare
2353   Such goodnesse of your Iustice, that our soule
2354   Cannot but yeeld you forth to publique thankes
2355   Forerunning more requitall.
2356   <S {Ang}.> You make my bonds still greater.
2357  *<S {Duk}.> Oh your desert speaks loud, & I should wrong it
2358   To locke it in the wards of couert bosome
2359   When it deserues with characters of brasse
2360   A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time,
2361   And razure of obliuion: Giue we your hand
2362   And let the Subiect see, to make them know
2363   That outward curtesies would faine proclaime
2364   Fauours that keepe within: Come {Escalus},
2365   You must walke by vs, on our other hand:
2366   And good supporters are you.
2367   <D {Enter Peter and Isabella}.>
2368   <S {Peter}.> Now is your time
2369   Speake loud, and kneele before him.
2370   <S {Isab}.> Iustice, O royall {Duke}, vaile your regard
2371   Vpon a wrong'd (I would faine haue said a Maid)
2372   Oh worthy Prince, dishonor not your eye
2373   By throwing it on any other obiect,
2374   Till you haue heard me, in my true complaint,
2375   And giuen me Iustice, Iustice, Iustice, Iustice.
2376   <S {Duk}.> Relate your wrongs;
2377   In what, by whom? be briefe:
2378   Here is Lord {Angelo} shall giue you Iustice,
2379   Reueale your selfe to him.
2380   <S {Isab}.> Oh worthy {Duke},
2381   You bid me seeke redemption of the diuell,
2382   Heare me your selfe: for that which I must speake
2383   Must either punish me, not being beleeu'd,
2384   Or wring redresse from you:
2385   Heare me: oh heare me, heere.
2386   <S {Ang}.> My Lord, her wits I feare me are not firme:
2387   She hath bin a suitor to me, for her Brother
2388   Cut off by course of Iustice.
2389   <S {Isab}.> By course of Iustice.
2390  *<S {Ang}.> And she will speake most bitterly, and strange.
      <P G4v>
2391  *<S {Isab}.> Most strange: but yet most truely wil I speake,
2392   That {Angelo}'s forsworne, is it not strange?
2393   That {Angelo}'s a murtherer, is't not strange?
2394   That {Angelo} is an adulterous thiefe,
2395   An hypocrite, a virgin violator,
2396   Is it not strange? and strange?
2397   <S {Duke}.> Nay it is ten times strange?
2398   <S {Isa}.> It is not truer he is {Angelo},
2399   Then this is all as true, as it is strange;
2400   Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth
2401   To th' end of reckning.
2402   <S {Duke}.> Away with her: poore soule
2403   She speakes this, in th' infirmity of sence.
2404   <S {Isa}.> Oh Prince, I coniure thee, as thou beleeu'st
2405   There is another comfort, then this world,
2406   That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
2407  *That I am touch'd with madnesse: make not impossible
2408   That which but seemes vnlike, 'tis not impossible
2409   But one, the wickedst caitiffe on the ground
2410   May seeme as shie, as graue, as iust, as absolute:
2411   As {Angelo}, euen so may {Angelo}
2412   In all his dressings, caracts, titles, formes,
2413   Be an arch- villaine: Beleeue it, royall Prince
2414   If he be lesse, he's nothing, but he's more,
2415   Had I more name for badnesse.
2416   <S {Duke}.> By mine honesty
2417   If she be mad, as I beleeue no other,
2418   Her madnesse hath the oddest frame of sense,
2419   Such a dependancy of thing, on thing,
2420   As ere I heard in madnesse.
2421   <S {Isab}.> Oh gracious {Duke}
2422   Harpe not on that; nor do not banish reason
2423   For inequality, but let your reason serue
2424   To make the truth appeare, where it seemes hid,
2425   And hide the false seemes true.
2426   <S {Duk}.> Many that are not mad
2427   Haue sure more lacke of reason:
2428   What would you say?
2429   <S {Isab}.> I am the Sister of one {Claudio},
2430   Condemnd vpon the Act of Fornication
2431   To loose his head, condemn'd by {Angelo},
2432   I, (in probation of a Sisterhood)
2433   Was sent to by my Brother; one {Lucio}
2434   As then the Messenger.
2435   <S {Luc}.> That's I, and't like your Grace:
2436   I came to her from {Claudio}, and desir'd her,
2437   To try her gracious fortune with Lord {Angelo},
2438   For her poore Brothers pardon.
2439   <S {Isab}.> That's he indeede.
2440   <S {Duk}.> You were not bid to speake.
2441   <S {Luc}.> No, my good Lord,
2442   Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
2443   <S {Duk}.> I wish you now then,
2444   Pray you take note of it: and when you haue
2445   A businesse for your selfe: pray heauen you then
2446   Be perfect.
2447   <S {Luc}.> I warrant your honor.
2448   <S {Duk}.> The warrant's for your selfe: take heede to't.
2449   <S {Isab}.> This Gentleman told somewhat  of my Tale.
2450   <S {Luc}.> Right.
2451   <S {Duk}.> It may be right, but you are i'the wrong
2452   To speake before your time: proceed,
2453   <S {Isab}.> I went
2454   To this pernicious Caitiffe Deputie.
2455   <S {Duk}.> That's somewhat madly spoken.
2456   <S {Isab}.> Pardon it,
      <C C>
2457   The phrase is to the matter.
2458   <S {Duke}.> Mended againe: the matter: proceed.
2459   <S {Isab}.> In briefe, to set the needlesse processe by:
2460   How I perswaded, how I praid, and kneel'd,
2461   How he refeld me, and how I replide
2462   (For this was of much length) the vild conclusion
2463   I now begin with griefe, and shame to vtter.
2464   He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
2465   To his concupiscible intemperate lust
2466   Release my brother; and after much debatement,
2467   My sisterly remorse, confutes mine honour,
2468   And I did yeeld to him: But the next morne betimes,
2469   His purpose surfetting, he sends a warrant
2470   For my poore brothers head.
2471   <S {Duke}.> This is most likely.
2472   <S {Isab}.> Oh that it were as like as it is true.
2473  *<S {Duk}.> By heauen (fond wretch) y knowst not what thou |(speak'st,
2474   Or else thou art suborn'd against his honor
2475   In hatefull practise: first his Integritie
2476   Stands without blemish: next it imports no reason,
2477   That with such vehemency he should pursue
2478   Faults proper to himselfe: if he had so offended
2479   He would haue waigh'd thy brother by himselfe,
2480   And not haue cut him off: some one hath set you on:
2481   Confesse the truth, and say by whose aduice
2482   Thou cam'st heere to complaine.
2483   <S {Isab}.> And is this all?
2484   Then oh you blessed Ministers aboue
2485   Keepe me in patience, and with ripened time
2486   Vnfold the euill, which is heere wrapt vp
2487   In countenance: heauen shield your Grace from woe,
2488   As I thus wrong'd, hence vnbeleeued goe.
2489   <S {Duke}.> I know you'ld faine be gone: An Officer:
2490   To prison with her: Shall we thus permit
2491   A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall,
2492   On him so neere vs? This needs must be a practise:
2493   Who knew of your intent and comming hither?
2494   <S {Isa}.> One that I would were heere, {Frier Lodowick}.
2495   <S {Duk}.> A ghostly Father, belike:
2496   Who knowes that {Lodowicke}?
2497   <S {Luc}.> My Lord, I know him, 'tis a medling Fryer,
2498   I doe not like the man: had he been Lay my Lord,
2499   For certaine words he spake against your Grace
2500   In your retirment, I had swing'd him soundly.
2501  *<S {Duke}.> Words against mee? #this' a good Fryer belike
2502   And to set on this wretched woman here
2503   Against our Substitute: Let this Fryer be found.
2504   <S {Luc}.> But yesternight my Lord, she and that Fryer
2505   I saw them at the prison: a sawcy Fryar,
2506   A very scuruy fellow.
2507   <S {Peter}.> Blessed be your Royall Grace:
2508   I haue stood by my Lord, and I haue heard
2509   Your royall eare abus'd: first hath this woman
2510   Most wrongfully accus'd your Substitute,
2511   Who is as free from touch, or soyle with her
2512   As she from one vngot.
2513   <S {Duke}.> We did beleeue no lesse.
2514   Know you that Frier {Lodowick} that she speakes of?
2515   <S {Peter}.> I know him for a man diuine and holy,
2516   Not scuruy, nor a temporary medler
2517   As he's reported by this Gentleman:
2518   And on my trust, a man that neuer yet
2519   Did (as he vouches) mis- report your Grace.
2520   <S {Luc}.> My Lord, most villanously, beleeue it.
2521  *<S {Peter}.> Well: he in time may come to cleere himselfe;
2522   But at this instant he is sicke, my Lord:
      <P G5>
2523   Of a strange Feauor: vpon his meere request
2524   Being come to knowledge, that there was complaint
2525   Intended 'gainst Lord {Angelo}, came I hether
2526   To speake as from his mouth, what he doth know
2527   Is true, and false: And what he with his oath
2528   And all probation will make vp full cleare
2529   Whensoeuer he's conuented: First for this woman,
2530   To iustifie this worthy Noble man
2531   So vulgarly and personally accus'd,
2532   Her shall you heare disproued to her eyes,
2533   Till she her selfe confesse it.
2534   <S {Duk}.> Good Frier, let's heare it:
2535   Doe you not smile at this, Lord {Angelo}?
2536   Oh heauen, the vanity of wretched fooles.
2537   Giue vs some seates, Come cosen {Angelo},
2538   In this I'll be impartiall: be you Iudge
2539   Of your owne Cause: Is this the Witnes Frier?
2540   <D {Enter Mariana}.>
2541   First, let her shew your face, and after, speake.
2542   <S {Mar}.> Pardon my Lord, I will not shew my face
2543   Vntill my husband bid me.
2544   <S {Duke}.> What, are you married?
2545   <S {Mar}.> No my Lord.
2546   <S {Duke}.> Are you a Maid?
2547   <S {Mar}.> No my Lord.
2548   <S {Duk}.> A Widow then?
2549   <S {Mar}.> Neither, my Lord.
2550  *<S {Duk}.> Why you are nothing then: neither Maid, Wi-dow,
2551   nor Wife?
2552  *<S {Luc}.> My Lord, she may be a Puncke: for many of
2553   them, are neither Maid, Widow, nor Wife.
2554  *<S {Duk}.> Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
2555   to prattle for himselfe.
2556   <S {Luc}.> Well my Lord.
2557   <S {Mar}.> My Lord, I doe confesse I nere was married,
2558   And I confesse besides, I am no Maid,
2559   I haue known my husband, yet my husband
2560   Knowes not, that euer he knew me.
2561  *<S {Luc}.> He was drunk then, my Lord, it can be no better.
2562  *<S {Duk}.> For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so #to.
2563   <S {Luc}.> Well, my Lord.
2564   <S {Duk}.> This is no witnesse for Lord {Angelo}.
2565   <S {Mar}.> Now I come to't, my Lord.
2566   Shee that accuses him of Fornication,
2567   In selfe- same manner, doth accuse my husband,
2568   And charges him, my Lord, with such a time,
2569   When I'le depose I had him in mine Armes
2570   With all th' effect of Loue.
2571   <S {Ang}.> Charges she moe then me?
2572   <S {Mar}.> Not that I know.
2573   <S {Duk}.> No? you say your husband.
2574   <S {Mar}.> Why iust, my Lord, and that is {Angelo},
2575   Who thinkes he knowes, that he nere knew my body,
2576   But knows, he thinkes, that he knowes {Isabels}.
2577   <S {Ang}.> This is a strange abuse: Let's see thy face.
2578   <S {Mar}.> My husband bids me, now I will vnmaske.
2579   This is that face, thou cruell {Angelo}
2580   Which once thou sworst, was worth the looking on:
2581   This is the hand, which with a vowd contract
2582   Was fast belockt in thine: This is the body
2583   That tooke away the match from {Isabell},
2584   And did supply thee at thy garden- house
2585   In her Imagin'd person.
2586   <S {Duke}.> Know you this woman?
2587   <S {Luc}.> Carnallie she saies.
2588   <S {Duk}.> Sirha, no more.
2589   <S {Luc}.> Enough my Lord.
2590  *<S {Ang}.> My Lord, I must confesse, I know this woman,
2591   And fiue yeres since there was some speech of marriage
2592   Betwixt my selfe, and her: which was broke off,
2593   Partly for that her promis'd proportions
2594   Came short of Composition: But in chiefe
2595   For that her reputation was dis- valued
2596   In leuitie: Since which time of fiue yeres
2597   I neuer spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her
2598   Vpon my faith, and honor.
2599   <S {Mar}.> Noble Prince,
2600  *As there comes light from heauen, and words fro[m] breath,
2601   As there is sence in truth, and truth in vertue,
2602   I am affianced this mans wife, as strongly
2603   As words could make vp vowes: And my good Lord,
2604   But Tuesday night last gon, in's garden house,
2605   He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
2606   Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
2607   Or else for euer be confixed here
2608   A Marble Monument.
2609   <S {Ang}.> I did but smile till now,
2610   Now, good my Lord, giue me the scope of Iustice,
2611   My patience here is touch'd: I doe perceiue
2612   These poore informall women, are no more
2613   But instruments of some more mightier member
2614   That sets them on. Let me haue way, my Lord
2615   To finde this practise out.
2616   <S {Duke}.> #I, with my heart,
2617   And punish them to your height of pleasure.
2618   Thou foolish Frier, and thou pernicious woman
2619  *Compact with her that's gone: thinkst thou, thy oathes,
2620  *Though they would swear downe each particular Saint,
2621   Were testimonies against his worth, and credit
2622   That's seald in approbation? you, Lord {Escalus}
2623   Sit with my Cozen, lend him your kinde paines
2624   To finde out this abuse, whence 'tis deriu'd.
2625   There is another Frier that set them on,
2626   Let him be sent for.
2627   <S {Peter}.> Would he were here, my Lord, for he indeed
2628   Hath set the women on to this Complaint;
2629   Your Prouost knowes the place where he abides,
2630   And he may fetch him.
2631   <S {Duke}.> Goe, doe it instantly:
2632   And you, my noble and well- warranted Cosen
2633   Whom it concernes to heare this matter forth,
2634   Doe with your iniuries as seemes you best
2635   In any chastisement; I for #a while
2636   Will leaue you; but stir not you till you haue
2637   Well determin'd vpon these Slanderers. <D {Exit}.>
2638  *<S {Esc}.> My Lord, wee'll doe it throughly: Signior {Lu-cio},
2639  *did not you say you knew that Frier {Lodowick} to be a
2640   dishonest person?
2641  *<S {Luc}.> {Cucullus non facit Monachum}, honest in nothing
2642  *but in his Clothes, and one that hath spoke most villa-nous
2643   speeches of the Duke.
2644  *<S {Esc}.> We shall intreat you to abide heere till he come,
2645  *and inforce them against him: we shall finde this Frier a
2646   notable fellow.
2647   <S {Luc}.> As any in {Vienna}, on my word.
2648  *<S {Esc}.> Call that same {Isabell} here once againe, I would
2649  *speake with her: pray you, my Lord, giue mee leaue to
2650   question, you shall see how Ile handle her.
2651   <S {Luc}.> Not better then he, by her owne report.
2652   <S {Esc}.> Say you?
2653   <S {Luc}.> Marry sir, I thinke, if you handled her priuately
      <P G5v><C D>
2654  *She would sooner confesse, perchance publikely she'll be
2655   asham'd.
2656   <D {Enter Duke, Prouost, Isabella}>.
2657   <S {Esc}.> I will goe darkely to worke with her.
2658  *<S {Luc}.> That's the way: for women are light at mid-night.
2659  _
2660   <S {Esc}.> Come on Mistris, here's a Gentlewoman,
2661   Denies all that you haue said.
2662   <S {Luc}.> My Lord, here comes the rascall I spoke of,
2663   Here, with the {Prouost}.
2664  *<S {Esc}.> In very good time: speake not you to him, till
2665   we call vpon you.
2666   <S {Luc}.> Mum.
2667  *<S {Esc}.> Come Sir, did you set these women on to slan-der
2668   Lord {Angelo}? they haue confes'd you did.
2669   <S {Duk}.> 'Tis false.
2670   <S {Esc}.> How? Know you where you are?
2671  *<S {Duk}.> Respect to your great place; and let the diuell
2672   Be sometime honour'd, for his burning throne.
2673   Where is the {Duke}? 'tis he should heare me speake.
2674  *<S {Esc}.> The {Duke's} in vs: and we will heare you speake,
2675   Looke you speake iustly.
2676   <S {Duk}.> Boldly, at least. But oh poore soules,
2677   Come you to seeke the Lamb here of the Fox;
2678   Good night to your redresse: Is the {Duke} gone?
2679   Then is your cause gone too: The {Duke's} vniust,
2680   Thus to retort your manifest Appeale,
2681   And put your triall in the villaines mouth,
2682   Which here you come to accuse.
2683   <S {Luc}.> This is the rascall: this is he I spoke of.
2684   <S {Esc}.> Why thou vnreuerend, and vnhallowed Fryer:
2685   Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women,
2686   To accuse this worthy man? but in foule mouth,
2687   And in the witnesse of his proper eare,
2688   To call him villaine; and then to glance from him,
2689   To th'{#Duke} himselfe, to taxe him with Iniustice?
2690  *Take him hence; to th' racke with him: #we'll towze you
2691   Ioynt by ioynt, but we will know his purpose:
2692   What? vniust?
2693   <S {Duk}.> Be not so hot: the {Duke} dare
2694   No more stretch this finger of mine, then he
2695   Dare racke his owne: his Subiect am I not,
2696   Nor here Prouinciall: My businesse in this State
2697   Made me a looker on here in {Vienna},
2698   Where I haue seene corruption boyle and bubble,
2699   Till it ore- run the Stew: Lawes, for all faults,
2700   But faults so countenanc'd, that the strong Statutes
2701   Stand like the forfeites in a Barbers shop,
2702   As much in mocke, as marke.
2703   <S {Esc}.> Slander to th' State:
2704   Away with him to prison.
2705  *<S {Ang}.> What can you vouch against him Signior {Lucio}?
2706   Is this the man you did tell vs of?
2707  *<S {Luc}.> 'Tis he, my Lord: come hither goodman bald- pate,
2708   doe you know me?
2709  *<S {Duk}.> I remember you Sir, by the sound of your voice,
2710   I met you at the Prison, in the absence of the {Duke}.
2711  *<S {Luc}.> Oh, did you so? and do you remember what you
2712   said of the {Duke}.
2713   <S {Duk}.> Most notedly Sir.
2714  *<S {Luc}.> Do you so Sir: And was the {Duke} a flesh- mon-ger,
2715  *a foole, and a coward, as you then reported him
2716   to be?
2717  *<S {Duk}.> You must (Sir) change persons with me, ere you
2718  *make that my report: you indeede spoke so of him, and
2719   much more, much worse.
2720  *<S {Luc}.> Oh thou damnable fellow: did I not plucke thee
2721   by the nose, for thy speeches?
2722   <S {Duk}.> I protest, I loue the {Duke}, as I loue my selfe.
2723  *<S {Ang}.> Harke how the villaine would close now, after
2724   his treasonable abuses.
2725  *<S {Esc}.> Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withall: Away
2726  *with him to prison: Where is the {Prouost}? away with
2727  *him to prison: lay bolts enough vpon him: let him speak
2728  *no more: away with those Giglets too, and with the o-ther
2729   confederate companion.
2730   <S {Duk}.> Stay Sir, stay #a while.
2731   <S {Ang}.> What, resists he? helpe him {Lucio}.
2732  *<S {Luc}.> Come sir, come sir, come sir: foh sir, why you
2733  *bald- pated lying rascall: you must be hooded must you?
2734  *show your knaues visage with a poxe to you: show your
2735  *sheepe- biting face, and be hang'd an houre: Will't
2736   not off?
2737  *<S {Duk}.> Thou art the first knaue, that ere mad'st a {Duke}.
2738   First {Prouost}, let me bayle these gentle three:
2739   Sneake not away Sir, for the Fryer, and you,
2740   Must haue a word anon: lay hold on him.
2741   <S {Luc}.> This may proue worse then hanging.
2742  *<S {Duk}.> What you haue spoke, I pardon: sit you downe,
2743   #We'll borrow place of him; Sir, by your leaue:
2744   Ha'st thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
2745   That yet can doe thee office? If thou ha'st
2746   Rely vpon it, till my tale be heard,
2747   And hold no longer out.
2748   <S {Ang}.> Oh, my dread Lord,
2749   I should be guiltier then my guiltinesse,
2750   To thinke I can be vndiscerneable,
2751   When I perceiue your grace, like powre diuine,
2752   Hath look'd vpon my passes. Then good Prince,
2753   No longer Session hold vpon my shame,
2754   But let my Triall, be mine owne Confession:
2755   Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
2756   Is all the grace I beg.
2757   <S {Duk}.> Come hither {Mariana},
2758   Say: was't thou ere contracted to this woman?
2759   <S {Ang}.> I was my Lord.
2760   <S {Duk}.> Goe take her hence, and marry her instantly.
2761   Doe you the office ({Fryer}) which consummate,
2762   Returne him here againe: goe with him {Prouost}.  <D {Exit}.>
2763   <S {Esc}.> My Lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonor,
2764   Then at the strangenesse of it.
2765   <S {Duk}.> Come hither {Isabell},
2766   Your {Frier} is now your Prince: As I was then
2767   Aduertysing, and holy to your businesse,
2768   (Not changing heart with habit) I am still,
2769   Atturnied at your seruice.
2770   <S {Isab}.> Oh giue me pardon
2771   That I, your vassaile, haue imploid, and pain'd
2772   Your vnknowne Soueraigntie.
2773   <S {Duk}.> You are pardon'd {Isabell}:
2774   And now, deere Maide, be you as free to vs.
2775   Your Brothers death I know sits at your heart:
2776   And you may maruaile, why I obscur'd my selfe,
2777   Labouring to saue his life: and would not rather
2778   Make rash remonstrance of my hidden powre,
2779   Then let him so be lost: oh most kinde Maid,
2780   It was the swift celeritie of his death,
2781   Which I did thinke, with slower foot came on,
2782   That brain'd my purpose: but peace be with him,
2783   That life is better life past fearing death,
2784   Then that which liues to feare: make it your comfort,
      <P G6>
2785   So happy is your Brother.
2786   <D {Enter Angelo, Maria, Peter, Prouost}.>
2787   <S {Isab}.> I doe my Lord.
2788   <S {Duk}.> For this new- maried man, approaching here,
2789   Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
2790   Your well defended honor: you must pardon
2791   For {Mariana's} sake: But as he adiudg'd your Brother,
2792   Being criminall, in double violation
2793   Of sacred Chastitie, and of promise- breach,
2794   Thereon dependant for your Brothers life,
2795   The very mercy of the Law cries out
2796   Most audible, euen from his proper tongue.
2797   An {Angelo} for {Claudio}, death for death:
2798   Haste still paies haste, and leasure, answers leasure;
2799   Like doth quit like, and {Measure} still for {Measure}:
2800   Then {Angelo}, thy fault's thus manifested;
2801  *Which though thou would'st deny, denies thee vantage.
2802   We doe condemne thee to the very Blocke
2803   Where {Claudio} stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
2804   Away with him.
2805   <S {Mar}.> Oh my most gracious Lord,
2806   I hope you will not mocke me with a husband?
2807  *<S {Duk}.> It is your husband mock't you with a husband,
2808   Consenting to the safe- guard of your honor,
2809   I thought your marriage fit: else Imputation,
2810   For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
2811   And choake your good to come: For his Possessions,
2812   Although by confutation they are ours;
2813   We doe en- state, and widow you with all,
2814   To buy you a better husband.
2815   <S {Mar}.> Oh my deere Lord,
2816   I craue no other, nor no better man.
2817   <S {Duke}.> Neuer craue him, we are definitiue.
2818   <S {Mar}.> Gentle my Liege.
2819   <S {Duke}.> You doe but loose your labour.
2820   Away with him to death: Now Sir, to you.
2821  *<S {Mar}.> Oh my good Lord, sweet {Isabell}, take my part,
2822   Lend me your knees, and all my life to come,
2823   I'll lend you all my life to doe you seruice.
2824   <S {Duke}.> Against all sence you doe importune her,
2825   Should she kneele downe, in mercie of this fact,
2826   Her Brothers ghost, his paued bed would breake,
2827   And take her hence in horror.
2828   <S {Mar}.> {Isabell}:
2829   Sweet {Isabel}, doe yet but kneele by me,
2830   Hold vp your hands, say nothing: I'll speake all.
2831   They say best men are moulded out of faults,
2832   And for the most, become much more the better
2833   For being a little bad: So may my husband.
2834   Oh {Isabel}: will you not lend a knee?
2835   <S {Duke}.> He dies for {Claudio's} death.
2836   <S {Isab}.> Most bounteous Sir.
2837   Looke if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
2838   As if my Brother liu'd: I partly thinke,
2839   A due sinceritie gouerned his deedes,
2840   Till he did looke on me: Since it is so,
2841   Let him not die: my Brother had but Iustice,
2842   In that he did the thing for which he dide.
2843   For {Angelo}, his Act did not ore- take his bad intent,
2844   And must be buried but as an intent
2845   That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subiects
2846   Intents, but meerely thoughts.
2847   <S {Mar}.> Meerely my Lord.
2848   <S {Duk}.> Your suite's vnprofitable: stand vp I say:
2849   I haue bethought me of another fault.
2850   {Prouost}, how came it {Claudio} was beheaded
      <C C>
2851   At an vnusuall howre?
2852   <S {Pro}.> It was commanded so.
2853   <S {Duke}.> Had you a speciall warrant for the deed?
2854  *<S {Pro}.> No my good Lord: it was by priuate message.
2855   <S {Duk}.> For which I doe discharge you of your office,
2856   Giue vp your keyes.
2857   <S {Pro}.> Pardon me, noble Lord,
2858   I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,
2859   Yet did repent me after more aduice,
2860   For testimony whereof,  one in the prison
2861   That should by priuate order else haue dide,
2862   I haue reseru'd aliue.
2863   <S {Duk}.> What's he?
2864   <S {Pro}.> His name is {Barnardine}.
2865   <S {Duke}.> I would thou hadst done so by {Claudio}:
2866   Goe fetch him hither, let me looke vpon him.
2867   <S {Esc}.> I am sorry, one so learned, and so wise
2868   As you, Lord {Angelo}, haue stil appear'd,
2869   Should slip so grosselie, both in the heat of bloud
2870   And lacke of temper'd iudgement afterward.
2871   <S {Ang}.> I am sorrie, that such sorrow I procure,
2872   And so deepe sticks it in my penitent heart,
2873   That I craue death more willingly then mercy,
2874   'Tis my deseruing, and I doe entreat it.
2875   <D {Enter Barnardine and Prouost, Claudio, Iulietta}.>
2876   <S {Duke}.> Which is that {Barnardine}?
2877   <S {Pro}.> This my Lord.
2878   <S {Duke}.> There was a Friar told me of this man.
2879   Sirha, thou art said to haue a stubborne soule
2880   That apprehends no further then this world,
2881   And squar'st thy life according: Thou'rt condemn'd,
2882   But for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
2883   And pray thee take this mercie to prouide
2884   For better times to come: Frier aduise him,
2885   I leaue him to your hand. What muffeld fellow's that?
2886   <S {Pro}.> This is another prisoner that I sau'd,
2887   Who should haue #di'd when {Claudio} lost his head,
2888   As like almost to {Claudio}, as himselfe.
2889   <S {Duke}.> If he be like your brother, for his sake
2890   Is he pardon'd, and for your louelie sake
2891   Giue me your hand, and say you will be mine,
2892   He is my brother too: But fitter time for that:
2893   By this Lord {Angelo} perceiues he's safe,
2894   Methinkes I see a quickning in his eye:
2895   Well {Angelo}, your euill quits you well.
2896  *Looke that you loue your wife: her worth, worth yours
2897   I finde an apt remission in my selfe:
2898   And yet heere's one in place I cannot pardon,
2899   You sirha, that knew me for a foole, a Coward,
2900   One all of Luxurie, an asse, a mad man:
2901   Wherein haue I so deseru'd of you
2902   That you extoll me thus?
2903  *<S {Luc}.> 'Faith my Lord, I spoke it but according to the
2904   trick: if you will hang me for it you may: but I  had ra-ther
2905   it would please you, I might be whipt.
2906   <S {Duke}.> Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
2907   Proclaime it Prouost round about the Citie,
2908   If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
2909   (As I haue heard him sweare himselfe there's one
2910   whom he begot with childe) let her appeare,
2911   And he shall marry her: the nuptiall finish'd,
2912   Let him be whipt and hang'd.
2913  *<S {Luc}.> I beseech your Highnesse doe not marry me to
2914  *a Whore: your Highnesse said euen now I made you a
2915  *Duke, good my Lord do not recompence me, in making
2916   me a Cuckold.
      <P G6v><C D>
2917   <S {Duke}.> Vpon mine honor thou shalt marrie her.
2918   Thy slanders I forgiue, and therewithall
2919   Remit thy other forfeits: take him to prison,
2920   And see our pleasure herein executed.
2921  *<S {Luc}.> Marrying a punke my Lord, is pressing to death,
2922   Whipping and hanging.
2923   <S {Duke}.> Slandering a Prince deserues it.
2924   She {Claudio} that you wrong'd, looke you restore.
2925   Ioy to you {Mariana}, loue her {Angelo}:
2926   I haue confes'd her, and I know her vertue.
2927   Thanks good friend, {Escalus}, for thy much goodnesse,
2928   There's more behinde that is more gratulate.
2929   Thanks {Prouost} for thy care, and secrecie,
2930   We shall imploy thee in a worthier place.
2931   Forgiue him {Angelo}, that brought you home
2932   The head of {Ragozine} for {Claudio's},
2933   Th' offence pardons it selfe. Deere {Isabell},
2934   I haue a motion much imports your good,
2935   Whereto if you'll a willing eare incline;
2936   What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.
2937   So bring vs to our Pallace, where wee'll show
2938   What's yet behinde, that meete you all should know.
