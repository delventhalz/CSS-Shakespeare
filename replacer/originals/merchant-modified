2      <D {Enter Anthonio, Salarino, and Salanio}.>
3      <S {Anthonio}.>
4      In sooth I know not why I am so sad,
5      It wearies me: you say it wearies you;
6      But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
7      What stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,
8     *I am to learne: and such a Want- wit sadnesse makes of
9      mee,
10     That I haue much ado to know my selfe.
11     <S {Sal}.> Your minde is tossing on the Ocean,
12     There where your Argosies with portly saile
13     Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,
14     Or as it were the Pageants of the sea,
15     Do ouer- peere the pettie Traffiquers
16     That curtsie to them, do them reuerence
17     As they flye by them with their wouen wings.
18     <S {Salar}.> Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,
19     The better part of my affections, would
20     Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
21     Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,
22     Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:
23     And euery obiect that might make me feare
24     Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
25     Would make me sad.
26     <S {Sal}.> My winde cooling my broth,
27     Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought
28     What harme a winde too great might doe at sea.
29     I should not see the sandie houre- glasse runne,
30     But I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,
31     And see my wealthy {Andrew} docks in sand,
32     Vailing her high top lower then her ribs
33     To kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church
34     And see the holy edifice of stone,
35     And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,
36     Which touching but my gentle Vessels side
37     Would scatter all her spices on the streame,
38     Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes,
39     And in a word, but euen now worth this,
40     And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought
41     To thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought
42     That such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?
43     But tell me, I know {Anthonio}
44     Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize.
45     <S {Anth}.> Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,
46     My ventures are not in one bottome trusted,
47     Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
      <C C>
48     Vpon the fortune of this present yeere:
49     Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad.
50     <S {Sola}.> Why then you are in loue.
51     <S {Anth}.> Fie, fie.
52    *<S {Sola}.> Not in loue neither: then let vs say you are sad
53     Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easie
54     For you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry
55     Because you are not sad. Now by two- headed {Ianus},
56     Nature hath fram'd strange fellowes in her time:
57     Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes,
58     And laugh like Parrats at a bag- piper.
59     And other of such vineger aspect,
60     That they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile,
61     Though {Nestor} sweare the iest be laughable.
62     <D {Enter Bassanio, Lorenso}, and {Gratiano}.>
63     <S {Sola}.> Heere comes {Bassanio},
64     Your most noble Kinsman,
65     {Gratiano}, and {Lorenso}. Faryewell,
66     We leaue you now with better company.
67     <S {Sala}.> I would haue staid till I had made you merry,
68     If worthier friends had not preuented me.
69     <S {Ant}.> Your worth is very deere in my regard.
70     I take it your owne busines calls on you,
71     And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
72     <S {Sal}.> Good morrow my good Lords.
73    *<S {Bass}.> Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, |(when?
74     You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
75     <S {Sal}.> Wee'll make our leysures to attend on yours.
76     <D {Exeunt Salarino, and Solanio}.>
77    *<S {Lor}.> My Lord {Bassanio}, since you haue found {Anthonio}
78     We two will leaue you, but at dinner time
79     I pray you haue in minde where we   must meete.
80     <S {Bass}.> I will not faile you.
81     <S {Grat}.> You looke not well signior {Anthonio},
82     You haue too much respect vpon the world:
83     They loose it that doe buy it with much care,
84     Beleeue me you are maruellously chang'd.
85     <S {Ant}.> I hold the world but as the world {Gratiano},
86     A stage, where euery man must play a part,
87     And mine a sad one.
88     <S {Grati}.> Let me play the foole,
89     With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,
90     And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,
91     Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.
92     Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,
93     Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?
94     Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies
      <P O4v><C B>
95     By being peeuish? I tell thee what {Anthonio},
96     I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:
97     There are a sort of men, whose visages
98     Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,
99     And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,
100    With purpose to be drest in an opinion
101    Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,
102    As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,
103    And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.
104    O my {Anthonio}, I do know of these
105    That therefore onely are reputed wise,
106    For saying nothing; when I am verie sure
107    If they should speake, would almost dam those eares
108    Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:
109    Ile tell thee more of this another time.
110    But fish not with this melancholly baite
111    For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:
112    Come good {Lorenzo}, faryewell #a while,
113    Ile end my exhortation after dinner.
114    <S {Lor}.> Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.
115    I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.
116    For {Gratiano} neuer let's me speake.
117   *<S {Gra}.> Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,
118    Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue.
119    <S {Ant}.> Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare.
120   *<S {Gra}.> Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable
121    In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.  <D {Exit}.>
122    <S {Ant}.> It is that any thing now.
123   *<S {Bas}.> {Gratiano} speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
124   *more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
125   *graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
126   *seeke all day ere you finde them, & when you haue them
127    they are not worth the search.
128    <S {An}.> Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same
129    To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage
130    That you to day promis'd to tel me of?
131    <S {Bas}.> Tis not vnknowne to you {Anthonio}
132    How much I haue disabled mine estate,
133    By something shewing   a more swelling port
134    Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:
135    Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd
136    From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care
137    Is to come fairely off from the great debts
138    Wherein my time something too prodigall
139    Hath left me gag'd: to you {Anthonio}
140    I owe the most in money, and in loue,
141    And from your loue I haue a warrantie
142    To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,
143    How to get cleere of all the debts I owe.
144    <S {An}.> I pray you good {Bassanio} let me know it,
145    And if it stand as you your selfe still do,
146    Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
147    My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes
148    Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions.
149   *<S {Bass}.> In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft
150    I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight
151    The selfesame way, with more aduised watch
152    To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,
153    I oft found both. I vrge this child- hoode proofe,
154    Because what followes is pure innocence.
155    I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,
156    That which I owe is lost: but if you please
157    To shoote another arrow that selfe way
158    Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
159    As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,
160    Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,
      <C C>
161    And thankfully rest debter for the first.
162    <S {An}.> You know me well, and herein spend but time
163    To winde about my loue with circumstance,
164    And out of doubt you doe more wrong
165    In making question of my vttermost
166    Then if you had made waste of all I haue:
167    Then doe but say to me what I should doe
168    That in your knowledge may by me be done,
169    And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake.
170    <S {Bass}.> In {Belmont} is a Lady richly left,
171    And she is faire, and fairer then that word,
172    Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes
173    I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:
174    Her name is {Portia}, nothing vndervallewd
175    To {Cato's} daughter, {Brutus Portia},
176    Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
177    For the four windes blow in from euery coast
178    Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks
179    Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
180    Which makes her seat of {Belmont Cholchos} strond,
181    And many {Iasons} come in quest of her.
182    O my {Anthonio}, had I but the meanes
183    To hold a riuall place with one of them,
184    I haue a minde presages me such thrift,
185    That I should questionlesse be fortunate.
186    <S {Anth}.> Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,
187    Neither haue I money, nor commodity
188    To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth
189    Try what my credit can in {Venice} doe,
190    That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,
191    To furnish thee to {Belmont} to faire {Portia}.
192    Goe presently enquire, and so will I
193    Where money is, and I no question make
194    To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.  <D {Exeunt}.>
195    <D {Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa}.>
196   *<S {Portia}.> By my troth {Nerrissa}, my little body is #a wea-rie
197    of this great world.
198   *<S {Ner}.> You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
199   *were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
200   *and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
201   *too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
202   *happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, super-fluitie
203   *comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
204    liues longer.
205    <S {Portia}.> Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
206    <S {Ner}.> They would be better if well followed.
207   *<S {Portia}.> If to doe were as easie as to know what were
208   *good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
209   *mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
210   *followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twen-tie
211   *what were good to be done, then be one of the twen-tie
212   *to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may de-uise
213   *lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
214   *colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
215   *ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
216   *reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
217   *the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
218   *nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the #wil of a liuing daugh-ter
219   *curb'd by the #will of a dead father: it is not hard {Ner-rissa},
220    that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none.
221   *<S {Ner}.> Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
222   *at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lot-terie
223   *that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
224   *siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
      <P O5><C D>
225   *chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any right-ly,
226   *but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
227   *is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
228    suters that are already come?
229   *<S {Por}.> I pray thee ouer- name them, and as thou namest
230   *them, I will describe them, and according to my descrip-tion
231    leuell at my affection.
232    <S {Ner}.> First there is the Neopolitane Prince.
233   *<S {Por}.> #I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
234   *talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropria-tion
235   *to his owne good parts that he can shoo him him-selfe:
236   *I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
237    with a Smyth.
238    <S {Ner}.> Than is there the Countie Palentine.
239   *<S {Por}.> He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
240   *say, #and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
241   *tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
242   *Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vn-mannerly
243   *sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be marri-ed
244   *to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to ei-ther
245    of these: God defend me from these two.
246   *<S {Ner}.> How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
247    {Le Boune}?
248   *<S {Por}.> God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
249   *man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
250   *why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a bet-ter
251   *bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
252   *is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
253   *#a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
254   *marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
255   *would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
256    to madnesse, I should neuer requite him.
257   *<S {Ner}.> What say you then to {Fauconbridge}, the yong
258    Baron of {England}?
259   *<S {Por}.> You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnder-stands
260   *not me, nor I him: he hath neither {Latine}, {French},
261   *nor {Italian}, and you will come into the Court & sweare
262   *that I haue a poore pennie- worth in the {English}: hee is a
263   *proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
264   *dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
265   *his doublet in {Italie}, his round hose in {France}, his bonnet
266    in {Germanie}, and his behauiour euery where.
267   *<S {Ner}.> What thinke you of the other Lord his neigh-bour?
268   _
269   *<S {Por}.> That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
270   *he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the {Englishman}, and
271   *swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
272   *thinke the {Frenchman} became his suretie, and seald vnder
273    for another.
274   *<S {Ner}.> How like you the yong {Germaine}, the Duke of
275    {Saxonies} Nephew?
276   *<S {Por}.> Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
277   *and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
278   *when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
279   *he is worst, he is little better then a beast: #and the worst
280   *fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go with-out
281    him.
282   *<S {Ner}.> If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
283   *Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers #will,
284    if you should refuse to accept him.
285   *<S {Por}.> Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
286   *a deepe glasse of Reinish- wine on the contrary Casket,
287   *for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
288   *I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing {Nerrissa}
289    ere I will be married to a spunge.
290   *<S {Ner}.> You neede not feare Lady the #hauing any of
291   *these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their deter-minations,
292   *which is indeede to returne to their home,
293   *and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
294   *be won by some other sort then your Fathers impositi-on,
295    depending on the Caskets.
296   *<S {Por}.> If I liue to be as olde as {Sibilla}, I will dye as
297   *chaste as {Diana}: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
298   *of my Fathers #will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
299   *are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
300   *I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire de-parture.
301   _
302   *<S {Ner}.> Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fa-thers
303   *time, a {Venecian}, a Scholler and a Souldior that
304   *came hither in companie of the Marquesse of {Mount-ferrat}?
305   _
306   *<S {Por}.> Yes, yes, it was {Bassanio}, as I thinke, so was hee
307    call'd.
308   *<S {Ner}.> True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
309   *foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
310    Lady.
311   *<S {Por}.> I remember him well, and I remember him wor-thy
312    of thy praise.
313    <D {Enter a Seruingman}.>
314   *<S {Ser}.> The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
315   *their leaue: and there is a fore- runner come from a fift,
316   *the Prince of {Moroco}, who brings word the Prince his
317    Maister will be here to night.
318   *<S {Por}.> If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
319   *heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
320   *glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
321   *and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
322   *shriue me then wiue me. Come {Nerrissa}, sirra go before;
323   *whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
324    knocks at the doore.  <D {Exeunt}.>
325    <D {Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew}.>
326    <S {Shy}.> Three thousand ducates, well.
327    <S {Bass}.> #I sir, for three months.
328    <S {Shy}.> For three months, well.
329    <S {Bass}.> For the which, as I told you,
330    {#Anthonio} shall be bound.
331    <S {Shy}.> {Anthonio} shall become bound, well.
332    <S {Bass}.> May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?
333    Shall I know your answere.
334    <S {Shy}.> Three thousand ducats for three months,
335    and {Anthonio} bound.
336    <S {Bass}.> Your answere to that.
337    <S {Shy}.> {Anthonio} is a good man.
338   *<S {Bass}.> Haue you heard any imputation to the con-trary.
339   _
340   *<S {Shy}.> Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
341   *good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is suffi-cient,
342   *yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argo-sie
343   *bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnder-stand
344   *moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexi-co,
345   *a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
346   *squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
347   *men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
348   *and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
349   *perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not with-standing
350   *sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
351    take his bond.
352    <S {Bas}.> Be assured you may.
      <P O5v>
353   *<S {Iew}.> I will be assured I may: and that I may be assu-red,
354   *I will bethinke mee, may I speake with {Antho-nio}?
355   _
356    <S {Bass}.> If it please you to dine with vs.
357   *<S {Iew}.> Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation
358   *which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell
359   *into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with
360   *you, walke with you, and so following: but I will
361   *not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.
362    What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
363    <D {Enter Anthonio}.>
364    <S {Bass}.> This is signior {Anthonio}.
365    <S {Iew}.> How like a fawning publican he lookes.
366    I hate him for he is a Christian:
367    But more, for that in low simplicitie
368    He lends out money gratis, and brings downe
369    The rate of vsance here with vs in {Venice}.
370    If I can catch him once vpon the hip,
371    I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.
372    He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes
373    Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate
374    On me, my bargaines, and my well- worne thrift,
375    Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe
376    If I forgiue him.
377    <S {Bass}.> {Shylock}, doe you heare.
378    <S {Shy}.> I am debating of my present store,
379    And by the neere gesse of my memorie
380    I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse
381    Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?
382    {Tuball} a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe
383    Will furnish me: but soft, how many months
384    Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,
385    Your worship was the last man in our mouthes.
386    <S {Ant}.> {Shylocke}, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
387    By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,
388    Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
389    Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest
390    How much he would?
391    <S {Shy}.> #I, #I, three thousand ducats.
392    <S {Ant}.> And for three months.
393    <S {Shy}.> I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
394    Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,
395    Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow
396    Vpon aduantage.
397    <S {Ant}.> I doe neuer vse it.
398    <S {Shy}.> When {Iacob} graz'd his vncle {Labans} sheepe,
399    This {Iacob} from our holy {Abram} was
400    (As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)
401    The third possesser; #I, he was the third.
402    <S {Ant}.> And what of him, did he take interrest?
403    <S {Shy}.> No, not take interest, not as you would say
404    Directly interest, marke what {Iacob} did,
405    When {Laban} and himselfe were compremyz'd
406    That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied
407    Should fall as {Iacobs} hier, the Ewes being rancke,
408    In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,
409    And when the worke of generation was
410    Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,
411    The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,
412    And in the #dooing of the deede of kinde,
413    He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,
414    Who then conceauing, did in eaning time
415    Fall party- colour'd lambs, and those were {Iacobs}.
416    This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:
417    And thrift is blessing if men steale it not.
418    <S {Ant}.> This was a venture sir that {Iacob} seru'd for,
419    A thing not in his power to bring to passe,
420    But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.
421    Was this inserted to make interrest good?
422    Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?
423    <S {Shy}.> I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,
424    But note me signior.
425    <S {Ant}.> Marke you this {Bassanio},
426    The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,
427    An euill soule producing holy witnesse,
428    Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,
429    A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
430    O what a goodly outside falsehood hath.
431    <S {Shy}.> Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.
432    Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate.
433    <S {Ant}.> Well {Shylocke}, shall we be beholding to you?
434    <S {Shy}.> Signior {Anthonio}, many a time and oft
435    In the Ryalto you haue rated me
436    About my monies and my vsances:
437    Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,
438    (For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)
439    You call me misbeleeuer, cut- throate dog,
440    And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,
441    And all for vse of that which is mine owne.
442    Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:
443    Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,
444    {#Shylocke}, we would haue moneyes, you say so:
445    You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,
446    And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre
447    Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.
448    What should I say to you? Should I not say,
449    Hath a dog money? Is it possible
450    A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or
451    Shall I bend low, and in a bond- mans key
452    With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,
453    Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;
454    You spurn'd me such a day; another time
455    You cald me dog: and for these curtesies
456    Ile lend you thus much moneyes.
457    <S {Ant}.> I am as like to call thee so againe,
458    To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.
459    If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
460    As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
461    A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?
462    But lend it rather to thine enemie,
463    Who if he breake, thou maist with better face
464    Exact the penalties.
465    <S {Shy}.> Why looke you how you storme,
466    I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,
467    Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,
468    Supplie your present wants, and take no doite
469    Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,
470    This is kinde I offer.
471    <S {Bass}.> This were kindnesse.
472    <S {Shy}.> This kindnesse will I showe,
473    Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there
474    Your single bond, and in a merrie sport
475    If you repaie me not on such a day,
476    In such a place, such sum or sums as are
477    Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite
478    Be nominated for an equall pound
479    Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken
480    In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me.
481    <S {Ant}.> Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,
482    And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew.
      <P O6>
483    <S {Bass}.> You shall not seale to such a bond for me,
484    Ile rather dwell in my necessitie.
485    <S {Ant}.> Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,
486    Within these two months, that's a month before
487    This bond expires, I doe expect returne
488    Of thrice three times the valew of this bond.
489    <S {Shy}.> O father {Abram}, what these Christians are,
490    Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect
491    The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,
492    If he should breake his daie, what should I gaine
493    By the exaction of the forfeiture?
494    A pound of mans flesh taken from a man,
495    Is not so estimable, profitable neither
496    As flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say
497    To buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,
498    If he will take it, so: if not adiew,
499    And for my loue I praie you wrong me not.
500    <S {Ant}.> Yes {Shylocke}, I will seale vnto this bond.
501    <S {Shy}.> Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,
502    Giue him direction for this merrie bond,
503    And I will goe and purse the ducats straite.
504    See to my house left in the fearefull gard
505    Of an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie
506    Ile be with you.  <D {Exit}.>
507   *<S {Ant}.> Hie thee gentle {Iew}. This Hebrew will turne
508    Christian, he growes kinde.
509    <S {Bass}.> I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde.
510    <S {Ant}.> Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,
511    My Shippes come home a month before the daie.
512    <D {Exeunt}.>
513    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
514   *<D {Enter Morochus a tawnie Moore all in white, and three or}
515    {foure followers accordingly, with Portia},
516    {Nerrissa, and their traine}.
517    {Flo. Cornets}.>
518    <S {Mor}.> Mislike me not for my complexion,
519    The shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne,
520    To whom I am a neighbour, and neere bred.
521    Bring me the fairest creature North- ward borne,
522    Where {Phoebus} fire scarce thawes the ysicles,
523    And let vs make incision for your loue,
524    To proue whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
525    I tell thee Ladie this aspect of mine
526    Hath feard the valiant, (by my loue I sweare)
527    The best regarded Virgins of our Clyme
528    Haue lou'd it #to: I would not change this hue,
529    Except to steale your thoughts my gentle Queene.
530    <S {Por}.> In tearmes of choise I am not solie led
531    By nice direction of a maidens eies:
532    Besides, the lottrie of my destenie
533    Bars me the right of voluntarie choosing:
534    But if my Father had not scanted me,
535    And hedg'd me by his wit to yeelde my selfe
536    His wife, who wins me by that meanes I told you,
537    Your selfe (renowned Prince) than stood as faire
538    As any commer I haue look'd on yet
539    For my affection.
540    <S {Mor}.> Euen for that I thanke you,
541    Therefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets
542    To trie my fortune: By this Symitare
543    That slew the Sophie, and a Persian Prince
544    That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
545    I would ore- stare the sternest eies that looke:
546    Out- braue the heart most daring on the earth:
547    Plucke the yong sucking Cubs from the #she Beare,
548    Yea, mocke the Lion when he rores for pray
549    To win the Ladie. But alas, the while
550    If {Hercules} and {Lychas} plaie at dice
551    Which is the better man, the greater throw
552    May turne by fortune from the weaker hand:
553    So is {Alcides} beaten by his rage,
554    And so may I, blinde fortune leading me
555    Misse that which one vnworthier may attaine,
556    And die with grieuing.
557    <S {Port}.> You must take your chance,
558    And either not attempt to choose at all,
559    Or sweare before you choose, if you choose wrong
560    Neuer to speake to Ladie afterward
561    In way of marriage, therefore be aduis'd.
562   *<S {Mor}.> Nor will not, come bring me vnto my chance.
563    <S {Por}.> First forward to the temple, after dinner
564    Your hazard shall be made.
565    <S {Mor}.> Good fortune then,  <D {Cornets}.>
566    To make me blest or cursed'st among men.  <D {Exeunt}.>
567    <D {Enter the Clowne alone}.>
568   *<S {Clo}.> Certainely, my conscience will serue me to run
569   *from this Iew my Maister: the fiend is at mine elbow,
570   *and tempts me, saying to me, {Iobbe}, {Launcelet Iobbe}, good
571   *{Launcelet}, or good {Iobbe}, or good {Launcelet Iobbe}, vse
572   *your legs, take the start, run awaie: my conscience saies
573   *no; take heede honest {Launcelet}, take heed honest {Iobbe},
574   *or as afore- said honest {Launcelet Iobbe}, doe not runne,
575   *scorne running with thy heeles; well, the most coragi-ous
576   *fiend bids me packe, {fia} saies the fiend, away saies
577   *the fiend, for the heauens rouse vp a braue minde saies
578   *the fiend, and run; well, my conscience hanging about
579   *the necke of my heart, saies verie wisely to me: my ho-nest
580   *friend {Launcelet},   being an honest mans sonne, or ra-ther
581   *an honest womans sonne, for indeede my Father did
582   *something smack, something grow #too; he had a kinde of
583   *taste; wel, my conscience saies {Lancelet} bouge not, bouge
584   *saies the fiend, bouge not saies my conscience, conscience
585   *say I you counsaile well, fiend say I you counsaile well,
586   *to be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the {Iew}
587   *my Maister, (who God blesse the marke) is a kinde of di-uell;
588   *and to run away from the {Iew} I should be ruled by
589   *the fiend, who sauing your reuerence is the diuell him-selfe:
590   *certainely the {Iew} is the verie diuell incarnation,
591   *and in my conscience, my conscience is a kinde of hard
592   *conscience, to offer to counsaile me to stay with the {Iew};
593   *the fiend giues the more friendly counsaile: I will runne
594   *fiend, my heeles are at your commandement, I will
595    runne.
596    <D {Enter old Gobbe with a Basket}.>
597   *<S {Gob}.> Maister yong- man, you I praie you, which is the
598    waie to Maister {Iewes}?
599   *<S {Lan}.> O heauens, this is my true begotten Father, who
600   *being more then sand- blinde, high grauel blinde, knows
601    me not, I will trie confusions with him.
602   *<S {Gob}.> Maister yong Gentleman, I praie you which is
603    the waie to Maister {Iewes}.
604   *<S {Laun}.> Turne vpon your right hand at the next tur-ning,
      <P O6v>
605   *but at the next turning of all on your left; marrie
606   *at the verie next turning, turne of no hand, but turn down
607    indirectlie to the {Iewes} house.
608   *<S {Gob}.> #Be Gods sonties 'twill be a hard waie to hit, can
609   *you tell me whether one {Launcelet} that dwels with him
610    dwell with him or no.
611   *<S {Laun}.> Talke you of yong Master {Launcelet}, marke
612   *me now, now will I raise the waters; talke you of yong
613    Maister {Launcelet}?
614   *<S {Gob}.> No Maister sir, but a poore mans sonne, his Fa-ther
615   *though I say't is an honest exceeding poore man,
616    and God be thanked well to liue.
617   *<S {Lan}.> Well, let his Father be what #a will, wee talke of
618    yong Maister {Launcelet}.
619    <S {Gob}.> Your worships friend and {Launcelet}.
620   *<S {Laun}.> But I praie you {ergo} old man, {ergo} I beseech you,
621    talke you of yong Maister {Launcelet}.
622    <S {Gob}.> Of {Launcelet}, ant please your maistership.
623   *<S {Lan}.> {Ergo} Maister {Lancelet}, talke not of maister {Lance-let}
624   *Father, for the yong gentleman according to fates and
625   *destinies, and such odde sayings, the sisters three, & such
626   *branches of learning, is indeede deceased, or as you
627    would say in plaine tearmes, gone to heauen.
628   *<S {Gob}.> Marrie God forbid, the boy was the verie staffe
629    of my age, my verie prop.
630   *<S {Lau}.> Do I look like a cudgell or a houell- post, a staffe
631    or a prop: doe you know me Father.
632   *<S {Gob}.> Alacke the day, I know you not yong Gentle-man,
633   *but I praie you tell me, is my boy God rest his soule
634    aliue or dead.
635    <S {Lan}.> Doe you not know me Father.
636    <S {Gob}.> Alacke sir I am sand blinde, I know you not.
637   *<S {Lan}.> Nay, indeede if you had your eies you might
638   *faile of the knowing me: it is a wise Father that knowes
639   *his owne childe. Well, old man, I will tell you newes of
640   *your son, giue me your blessing, truth will come to light,
641   *murder cannot be hid long, a mans sonne may, but in the
642    end truth will out.
643   *<S {Gob}.> Praie you sir stand vp, I am sure you are not
644    {Lancelet} my boy.
645   *<S {Lan}.> Praie you let's haue no more fooling about
646   *it, but giue mee your blessing: I am {Lancelet} your
647   *boy that was, your sonne that is, your childe that
648    shall be.
649    <S {Gob}.> I cannot thinke you are my sonne.
650   *<S {Lan}.> I know not what I shall thinke of that: but I am
651   *{#Lancelet} the {Iewes} man, and I am sure {Margerie} your wife
652    is my mother.
653   *<S {Gob}.> Her name is {Margerie} indeede, Ile be sworne if
654   *thou be {Lancelet}, thou art mine owne flesh and blood:
655   *Lord worshipt might he be, what a beard hast thou got;
656   *thou hast got more haire on thy chin, then Dobbin my
657    philhorse has on his taile.
658   *<S {Lan}.> It should seeme then that Dobbins taile
659   *growes backeward. I am sure he had more haire of his
660    taile then I haue of my face when I last saw him.
661   *<S {Gob}.> Lord how art thou chang'd: how doost thou
662   *and thy Master agree, I haue brought him a present; how
663    gree you now?
664   *<S {Lan}.> Well, well, but for mine owne part, as I haue set
665   *vp my rest to run awaie, so I will not rest till I haue run
666   *some ground; my Maister's a verie {Iew}, giue him a pres-ent,
667   *giue him a halter, I am famisht in his seruice. You
668   *may tell euerie finger I haue with my ribs: Father I am
669   *glad you are come, giue me your present to one Maister
670   *{Bassanio}, who indeede giues rare new Liuories, if I serue
671   *not him, I will run as far as God has anie ground. O rare
672   *fortune, here comes the man, to him Father, for I am a
673    {#Iew} if I serue the {Iew} anie longer.
674    <D {Enter Bassanio with a follower or two}.>
675   *<S {Bass}.> You may doe so, but let it be so hasted that
676   *supper be readie at the farthest by fiue of the clocke:
677   *see these Letters deliuered, put the Liueries to mak-ing,
678   *and desire {Gratiano} to come anone to my lodg-ing.
679   _
680    <S {Lan}.> To him Father.
681    <S {Gob}.> God blesse your worship.
682    <S {Bass}.> Gramercie, would'st thou ought with me.
683    <S {Gob}.> Here's   my sonne sir, a poore boy.
684   *<S {Lan}.> Not a poore boy sir, but the rich {Iewes} man that
685    would sir as my Father shall specifie.
686   *<S {Gob}.> He hath a great infection sir, as one would say
687    to serue.
688   *<S {Lan}.> Indeede the short and the long is, I serue the
689    {#Iew}, and haue a desire as my Father shall specifie.
690   *<S {Gob}.> His Maister and he (sauing your worships reue-rence)
691    are scarce catercosins.
692   *<S {Lan}.> To be briefe, the verie truth is, that the {Iew}
693   *hauing done me wrong, doth cause me as my Father be-ing
694    I hope an old man shall frutifie vnto you.
695   *<S {Gob}.> I haue here a dish of Doues that I would bestow
696    vpon your worship, and my suite is.
697   *<S {Lan}.> In verie briefe, the suite is impertinent to my
698   *selfe, as your worship shall know by this honest old man,
699   *and though I say it, though old man, yet poore man my
700    Father.
701    <S {Bass}.> One speake for both, what would you?
702    <S {Lan}.> Serue you sir.
703    <S {Gob}.> That is the verie defect of the matter sir.
704    <S {Bass}.> I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suite,
705    {#Shylocke} thy Maister spoke with me this daie,
706    And hath prefer'd thee, if it be preferment
707    To leaue a rich {Iewes} seruice, to become
708    The follower of so poore a Gentleman.
709   *<S {Clo}.> The old prouerbe is verie well parted betweene
710   *my Maister {Shylocke} and you sir, you haue the grace of
711    God sir, and he hath enough.
712   *<S {Bass}.> Thou speak'st well; go Father with thy Son,
713    Take leaue of thy old Maister, and enquire
714    My lodging out, giue him a Liuerie
715    More garded then his fellowes: see it done.
716   *<S {Clo}.> Father in, I cannot get a seruice, no, I haue nere
717   *a tongue in my head, well: if anie man in {Italie} haue a
718   *fairer table which doth offer to sweare vpon a booke, I
719   *shall haue good fortune; goe #too, here's a simple line
720   *of life, here's a small trifle of wiues, alas, fifteene wiues
721   *is nothing, #a leuen widdowes and nine maides is a sim-ple
722   *comming in for one man, and then to scape drow-ning
723   *thrice, and to be in perill of my life with the edge
724   *of a featherbed, here are simple scapes: well, if Fortune
725   *be a woman, she's a good wench for this gere: Father
726    come, Ile take my leaue of the {Iew} in the twinkling.
727    <D {Exit Clowne}.>
728    <S {Bass}.> I praie thee good {Leonardo} thinke on this,
729    These things being bought and orderly bestowed
730    Returne in haste, for I doe feast to night
731    My best esteemd acquaintance, hie thee goe.
732   *<S {Leon}.> my best endeuors shall be done herein.  <D {Exit #Le}.>

734    <S {Gra}.> Where's your Maister.
      <P P1>
735    <S {Leon}.> Yonder sir he walkes.
736    <S {Gra}.> Signior {Bassanio}.
737    <S {Bas}.> {Gratiano}.
738    <S {Gra}.> I haue a sute to you.
739    <S {Bass}.> You haue obtain'd it.
740   *<S {Gra}.> You must not denie me, I must goe with you to
741    Belmont.
742   *<S {Bass}.> Why then you must: but heare thee {Gratiano},
743    Thou art #to wilde, #to rude, and bold of voyce,
744    Parts that become thee happily enough,
745    And in such eyes as ours appeare not faults;
746    But where they are not knowne, why there they show
747    Something too liberall, pray thee take paine
748    To allay with some cold drops of modestie
749   *Thy skipping spirit, least through thy wilde behauiour
750    I be misconsterd in the place I goe to,
751    And loose my hopes.
752    <S {Gra}.> Signor {Bassanio}, heare me,
753    If I doe not put on a sober habite,
754    Talke with respect, and sweare but now and than,
755    Weare prayer bookes in my pocket, looke demurely,
756    Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes
757    Thus with my hat, and sigh and say Amen:
758    Vse all the obseruance of ciuillitie
759    Like one well studied in a sad ostent
760    To please his Grandam, neuer trust me more.
761    <S {Bas}.> Well, we shall see your bearing.
762   *<S {Gra}.> Nay but I barre to night, you shall not gage me
763    By what we doe to night.
764    <S {Bas}.> No that were pittie,
765    I would intreate you rather to put on
766    Your boldest suite of mirth, for we haue friends
767    That purpose merriment: but far you well,
768    I haue some businesse.
769    <S {Gra}.> And I must to {Lorenso} and the rest,
770    But we will visite you at supper time.  <D {Exeunt}.>
771    <D {Enter Iessica and the Clowne}.>
772    <S {Ies}.> I am sorry thou wilt leaue my Father so,
773    Our house is #hell, and thou a merrie diuell
774    Did'st rob it of some taste of tediousnesse;
775    But far thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
776    And {Lancelet}, soone at supper shalt thou see
777    {Lorenzo}, who is thy new Maisters guest,
778    Giue him this Letter, doe it secretly,
779    And so farewell: I would not haue my Father
780    see me talke with thee.
781   *<S {Clo}.> Adue, teares exhibit my tongue, most beautifull
782   *Pagan, most sweete Iew, if a Christian doe not play the
783   *knaue and get thee, I am much deceiued; but adue, these
784   *foolish drops doe somewhat drowne my manly spirit:
785    adue.  <D {Exit}.>
786    <S {Ies}.> Farewell good {Lancelet}.
787    Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me
788    To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe,
789    But though I am a daughter to his blood,
790    I am not to his manners: O {Lorenzo},
791    If thou keepe promise I shall end this strife,
792    Become a Christian, and thy louing wife.  <D {Exit}.>
793    <D {Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino, and Salanio}.>
794    <S {Lor}.> Nay, we will slinke away in supper time,
795    Disguise vs at my lodging, and returne all in an houre.
796    <S {Gra}.> We haue not made good preparation.
797    <S {Sal}.> We haue not spoke vs yet of Torch- bearers.
798    <S {Sol}.> 'Tis vile vnlesse it may be quaintly ordered,
799    And better in my minde not vndertooke.
800   *<S {Lor}.> 'Tis now but foure of clock, we haue two houres
801    To furnish vs; friend {Lancelet} what's the newes.
802    <D {Enter Lancelet with a Letter}.>
803   *<S {Lan}.> #And it shall please you to breake vp this, shall it
804    seeme to signifie.
805    <S {Lor}.> I know the hand, in faith 'tis a faire hand
806    And whiter then the paper it writ on,
807    Is the faire hand that writ.
808    <S {Gra}.> Loue newes in faith.
809    <S {Lan}.> By your leaue sir.
810    <S {Lor}.> Whither goest thou?
811   *<S {Lan}.> Marry sir to bid my old Master the {Iew} to sup
812    to night with my new Master the Christian.
813    <S {Lor}.> Hold here, take this, tell gentle {Iessica}
814    I will not faile her, speake it priuately:
815   *Go Gentlemen, will you prepare you for this Maske to
816    night,
817    I am prouided of a Torch- bearer.  <D {Exit. Clowne}.>
818    <S {Sal}.> #I marry, ile be gone about it strait.
819    <S {Sol}.> And so will I.
820    <S {Lor}.> Meete me and {Gratiano} at {Gratianos} lodging
821    Some houre hence.
822    <S {Sal}.> 'Tis good we do so.  <D {Exit}.>
823    <S {Gra}.> Was not that Letter from faire {Iessica}?
824    <S {Lor}.> I must needes tell thee all, she hath directed
825    How I shall take her from her Fathers house,
826    What gold and iewels she is furnisht with,
827    What Pages suite she hath in readinesse:
828    If ere the {Iew} her Father come to heauen,
829    It will be for his gentle daughters sake;
830    And neuer dare misfortune crosse her foote,
831    Vnlesse she doe it vnder this excuse,
832    That she is issue to a faithlesse {Iew}:
833    Come goe with me, pervse this as thou goest,
834    Faire {Iessica} shall be my Torch- bearer.  <D {Exit}.>
835    <D {Enter Iew, and his man that was the Clowne}.>
836    <S {Iew}.> Well, thou shall see, thy eyes shall be thy iudge,
837    The difference of old {Shylocke} and {Bassanio};
838    What {Iessica}, thou shalt not gurmandize
839    As thou hast done with me: what {Iessica}?
840    And sleepe, and snore, and rend apparrell out.
841    Why {Iessica} I say.
842    <S {Clo}.> Why {Iessica}.
843    <S {Shy}.> Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
844    <S {Clo}.> Your worship was wont to tell me
845    I could doe nothing without bidding.
846    <D {Enter Iessica}.>
847    <S {Ies}.> Call you? what is your #will?
848    <S {Shy}.> I am bid forth to supper {Iessica},
849    There are my Keyes: but wherefore should I go?
850    I am not bid for loue, they flatter me,
851    But yet Ile goe in hate, to feede vpon
852    The prodigall Christian. {Iessica} my girle,
853    Looke to my house, I am right loath to goe,
854    There is some #ill #a bruing towards my rest,
855    For I did dreame of money bags to night.
856    <S {Clo}.> I beseech you sir goe, my yong Master
857    Doth expect your reproach.
858    <S {Shy}.> So doe I his.
859   *<S {Clo}.> And they haue conspired together, I will not say
860   *you shall see a Maske, but if you doe, then it was not for
861   *nothing that my nose fell #a bleeding on blacke monday
      <P P1v><C C>
862   *last, at six #a clocke ith morning, falling out that yeere on
863    ashwensday was foure yeere in th' afternoone.
864    <S {Shy}.> What are their maskes? heare you me {Iessica},
865    Lock vp my doores, and when you heare the drum
866    And the vile squealing of the wry- neckt Fife,
867    Clamber not you vp to the casements then,
868    Nor thrust your head into the publique streete
869    To gaze on Christian fooles with varnisht faces:
870    But stop my houses eares, I meane my casements,
871    Let not the sound of shallow fopperie enter
872    My sober house. By {Iacobs} staffe I sweare,
873    I haue no minde of feasting forth to night:
874    But I will goe: goe you before me sirra,
875    Say I will come.
876    <S {Clo}.> I will goe before sir,
877    Mistris looke out at window for all this;
878    There will come a Christian by,
879    Will be worth a Iewes eye.
880   *<S {Shy}.> What saies that foole of {Hagars} off- spring?
881    ha.
882    <S {Ies}.> His words were farewell mistris, nothing else.
883    <S {Shy}.> The patch is kinde enough, but a huge feeder:
884    Snaile- slow in profit, but he sleepes by day
885    More then the wilde- cat: drones hiue not with me,
886    Therefore I part with him, and part with him
887    To one that I would haue him helpe to waste
888    His borrowed purse. Well {Iessica} goe in,
889    Perhaps I will returne immediately;
890   *Doe as I bid you, shut dores after you, fast binde, fast
891    finde,
892    A prouerbe neuer stale in thriftie minde.  <D {Exit}.>
893    <S {Ies}.> Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,
894    I haue a Father, you a daughter lost.  <D {Exit}.>
895    <D {Enter the Maskers, Gratiano and Salino}.>
896    <S {Gra}.> This is the penthouse vnder which {Lorenzo}
897    Desired vs to make a stand.
898    <S {Sal}.> His houre is almost past.
899    <S {Gra}.> And it is meruaile he out- dwels his houre,
900    For louers euer run before the clocke.
901    <S {Sal}.> O ten times faster {Venus} Pidgions flye
902    To steale loues bonds new made, then they are wont
903    To keepe obliged faith vnforfaited.
904    <S {Gra}.> That euer holds, who riseth from a feast
905    With that keene appetite that he sits downe?
906    Where is the horse that doth vntread againe
907    His tedious measures with the vnbated fire,
908    That he did pace them first: all things that are,
909    Are with more spirit chased then enioy'd.
910    How like a yonger or a prodigall
911    The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay,
912    Hudg'd and embraced by the strumpet winde:
913    How like a prodigall doth she returne
914    With ouer- wither'd ribs and ragged sailes,
915    Leane, rent, and begger'd by the strumpet winde?
916    <D {Enter Lorenzo}.>
917   *<S {Salino}.> Heere comes {Lorenzo}, more of this here-after.
918   _
919   *<S {Lor}.> Sweete friends, your patience for my long a-bode,
920   _
921    Not I, but my affaires haue made you wait;
922    When you shall please to play the theeues for wiues
923    Ile watch as long for you then: approach
      <C D>
924    Here dwels my father Iew. Hoa, who's within?
925    <D {#Iessica aboue}.>
926    <S {Iess}.> Who are you? tell me for more certainty,
927    Albeit Ile sweare that I do know your tongue.
928    <S {Lor}.> {Lorenzo}, and thy Loue.
929    <S {Ies}.> {Lorenzo} certaine, and my loue indeed,
930    For who loue I so much? and now who knowes
931    But you {Lorenzo}, whether I am yours?
932   *<S {Lor}.> Heauen and thy thoughts are witness that thou
933    art.
934    <S {Ies}.> Heere, catch this casket, it is worth the paines,
935    I am glad 'tis night, you do not looke on me,
936    For I am much asham'd of my exchange:
937    But loue is blinde, and louers cannot see
938    The pretty follies that themselues commit,
939    For if they could, {Cupid} himselfe would blush
940    To see me thus transformed to a boy.
941    <S {Lor}.> Descend, for you must be my torch- bearer.
942    <S {Ies}.> What, must I hold a Candle to my shames?
943    They in themselues goodsooth are too too light.
944    Why, 'tis an office of discouery Loue,
945    And I should be obscur'd.
946    <S {Lor}.> So you are sweet,
947    Euen in the louely garnish of a boy: but come at once,
948    For the close night doth play the run- away,
949    And we are staid for at {Bassanio's} feast.
950    <S {Ies}.> I will make fast the doores and guild my selfe
951    With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
952    <S {Gra}.> Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Iew.
953    <S {Lor}.> Beshrew me but I loue her heartily.
954    For she is wise, if I can iudge of her.
955    And faire she is, if that mine eyes be true,
956    And true she is, as she hath prou'd her selfe:
957    And therefore like her selfe, wise, faire, and true,
958    Shall she be placed in my constant soule.
959    <D {Enter Iessica}.>
960    What, art thou come? on gentlemen, away,
961    Our masking mates by this time for vs stay.  <D {Exit}.>
962    <D {Enter Anthonio}.>
963    <S {Ant}.> Who's there?
964    <S {Gra}.> Signior {Anthonio}?
965    <S {Ant}.> Fie, fie, {Gratiano}, where are all the rest?
966    'Tis nine #a clocke, our friends all stay for you,
967    No maske to night, the winde is come about,
968    {#Bassanio} presently will goe aboord,
969    I haue sent twenty out to seeke for you.
970    <S {Gra}.> I am glad on't, I desire no more delight
971    Then to be vnder saile, and gone to night.  <D {Exeunt}.>
972    <D {Enter Portia with Morrocho, and both their traines}.>
973    <S {Por}.> Goe, draw aside the curtaines, and discouer
974    The seuerall Caskets to this noble Prince:
975    Now make your choyse.
976    <S {Mor}.> The first of gold, who this inscription beares,
977    Who chooseth me, shall gaine what men desire.
978    The second siluer, which this promise carries,
979    Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
980    This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
981    Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
982    How shall I know if I doe choose the right?
      <P P2>
983    How shall I know if I doe choose the right.
984   *<S {Por}.> The one of them containes my picture Prince,
985    If you choose that, then I am yours withall.
986   *<S {Mor}.> Some God direct my iudgement, let me see,
987    I will suruay the inscriptions, backe againe:
988    What saies this leaden casket?
989    Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
990    Must giue, for what? for lead, hazard for lead?
991    This casket threatens men that hazard all
992    Doe it in hope of faire aduantages:
993    A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse,
994    Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead.
995    What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue?
996    Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
997    As much as he deserues; pause there {Morocho},
998    And weigh thy value with an euen hand,
999    If thou beest rated by thy estimation
1000   Thou doost deserue enough, and yet enough
1001   May not extend so farre as to the Ladie:
1002   And yet to be afeard of my deseruing,
1003   Were but a weake disabling of my selfe.
1004   As much as I deserue, why that's the Lady.
1005   I doe in birth deserue her, and in fortunes,
1006   In graces, and in qualities of breeding:
1007   But more then these, in loue I doe deserue.
1008   What if I strai'd no farther, but chose here?
1009   Let's see once more this saying grau'd in gold.
1010  *Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire:
1011   Why that's the Lady, all the world desires her:
1012   From the foure corners of the earth they come
1013   To kisse this shrine, this mortall breathing Saint.
1014   The Hircanion deserts, and the vaste wildes
1015   Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
1016   For Princes to come view faire {Portia}.
1017   The waterie Kingdome, whose ambitious head
1018   Spets in the face of heauen, is no barre
1019   To stop the forraine spirits, but they come
1020   As ore a brooke to see faire {Portia}.
1021   One of these three containes her heauenly picture.
1022   Is't like that Lead containes her? 'twere damnation
1023   To thinke so base a thought, it were too grose
1024   To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue:
1025   Or shall I thinke in Siluer she's immur'd
1026   Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold;
1027   O sinfull thought, neuer so rich a Iem
1028   Was set in worse then gold! They haue in England
1029   A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell
1030   Stampt in gold, but that's insculpt vpon:
1031   But here an Angell in a golden bed
1032   Lies all within.   Deliuer me the key:
1033   Here doe I choose, and thriue I as I may.
1034  *<S {Por}.> There take it Prince, and if my forme lye there
1035   Then I am yours.
1036   <S {Mor}.> O #hell! what haue we here, a carrion death,
1037   Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule;
1038   Ile reade the writing.
1039   {All that glisters is not gold},
1040   {Often haue you heard that told;}
1041   {Many a man his life hath sold}
1042   {But my outside to behold;}
1043   {Guilded timber doe wormes infold}:
1044   {Had you beene as wise as bold},
1045   {Yong in limbs, in iudgement old},
1046   {Your answere had not beene inscrold},
1047   {Fareyouwell, your suite is cold},
1048   <S {Mor}.> Cold indeede, and labour lost,
1049   Then farewell heate, and welcome frost:
1050   {#Portia} adew, I haue too grieu'd a heart
1051   To take a tedious leaue: thus loosers part.  <D {Exit}.>
1052   <S {Por}.> A gentle riddance: draw the curtaines, go:
1053   Let all of his complexion choose me so.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1054   <D {Enter Salarino and Solanio}.>
1055   <D {Flo. Cornets}.>
1056   <S {Sal}.> Why man I saw {Bassanio} vnder sayle;
1057   With him is {Gratiano} gone along;
1058   And in their ship I am sure {Lorenzo} is not.
1059   <S {Sol}.> The villaine {Iew} with outcries raisd the Duke.
1060   Who went with him to search {Bassanios} ship.
1061   <S {Sal}.> He comes too late, the ship was vndersaile;
1062   But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand
1063   That in a Gondilo were seene together
1064   {Lorenzo} and his amorous {Iessica}.
1065   Besides, {Anthonio} certified the Duke
1066   They were not with {Bassanio} in his ship.
1067   <S {Sol}.> I neuer heard a passion so confusd,
1068   So strange, outragious, and so variable,
1069   As the dogge {Iew} did vtter in the streets;
1070   My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter,
1071   Fled with a Christian, O my Christian ducats!
1072   Iustice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter;
1073   A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
1074   Of double ducats, stolne from me by my daughter,
1075   And iewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
1076   Stolne by my daughter: iustice, finde the girle,
1077   She hath the stones vpon her, and the ducats.
1078   <S {Sal}.> Why all the boyes in Venice follow him,
1079   Crying his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
1080   <S {Sol}.> Let good {Anthonio} looke he keepe his day
1081   Or he shall pay for this.
1082   <S {Sal}.> Marry well remembred,
1083   I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
1084   Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
1085   The French and English, there miscaried
1086   A vessell of our countrey richly fraught:
1087   I thought vpon {Anthonio} when he told me,
1088   And wisht in silence that it were not his.
1089   <S {Sol}.> You were best to tell {Anthonio} what you heare.
1090   Yet doe not suddainely, for it may grieue him.
1091   <S {Sal}.> A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth,
1092   I saw {Bassanio} and {Anthonio} part,
1093   {Bassanio} told him he would make some speede
1094   Of his returne: he answered, doe not so,
1095   Slubber not businesse for my sake {Bassanio},
1096   But stay the very riping of the time,
1097   And for the {Iewes} bond which he hath of me,
1098   Let it not enter in your minde of loue:
1099   Be merry, and imploy your chiefest thoughts
1100   To courtship, and such faire ostents of loue
1101   As shall conueniently become you there;
1102   And euen there his eye being big with teares,
1103   Turning his face, he put his hand behinde him,
1104   And with affection wondrous sencible
1105   He wrung {Bassanios} hand, and so they parted.
1106   <S {Sol}.> I thinke he onely loues the world for him,
1107   I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out
1108   And quicken his embraced heauinesse
1109   With some delight or other.
1110   <S {Sal}.> Doe we so.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1111   <D {Enter Nerrissa and a Seruiture}.>
1112  *<S {Ner}.> Quick, quick I pray thee, draw the curtain strait,
      <P P2v>
1113   The Prince of Arragon hath tane his oath,
1114   And comes to his election presently.
1115   <D {Enter Arragon, his traine, and Portia}.
1116   {Flor. Cornets}.>
1117   <S {Por}.> Behold, there stand the caskets noble Prince,
1118   If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
1119   Straight shall our nuptiall rights be solemniz'd:
1120   But if thou faile, without more speech my Lord,
1121   You must be gone from hence immediately.
1122   <S {Ar}.> I am enioynd by oath to obserue three things;
1123   First, neuer to vnfold to any one
1124   Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I faile
1125   Of the right casket, neuer in my life
1126   To wooe a maide in way of marriage:
1127   Lastly, if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse,
1128   Immediately to leaue you, and be gone.
1129   <S {Por}.> To these iniunctions euery one doth sweare
1130   That comes to hazard for my worthlesse selfe.
1131   <S {Ar}.> And so haue I addrest me, fortune now
1132   To my hearts hope: gold, siluer, and base lead.
1133   Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath.
1134   You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard.
1135   What saies the golden chest, ha, let me see.
1136   Who chooseth me, shall gaine what many men desire:
1137   What many men desire, that many may be meant
1138   By the foole multitude that choose by show,
1139   Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach,
1140   Which pries not to th' interior, but like the Martlet
1141   Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
1142   Euen in the force and rode of casualtie.
1143   I will not choose what many men desire,
1144   Because I will not iumpe with common spirits,
1145   And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes.
1146   Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house,
1147   Tell me once more, what title thou doost beare;
1148   Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues:
1149   And well said too; for who shall goe about
1150   To cosen Fortune, and be honourable
1151   Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume
1152   To weare an vndeserued dignitie:
1153   O that estates, degrees, and offices,
1154   Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour
1155   Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer;
1156   How many then should couer that stand bare?
1157   How many be commanded that command?
1158   How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned
1159   From the true seede of honor? And how much honor
1160   Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times,
1161   To be new varnisht: Well, but to my choise.
1162   Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues.
1163   I will assume desert; giue me a key for this,
1164   And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here.
1165   <S {Por}.> Too long a pause for that which you finde there.
1166   <S {Ar}.> What's here, the portrait of a blinking idiot
1167   Presenting me a scedule, I will reade it:
1168   How much vnlike art thou to {Portia}?
1169   How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings?
1170   Who chooseth me, shall haue as much as he deserues.
1171   Did I deserue no more then a fooles head,
1172   Is that my prize, are my deserts no better?
1173   <S {Por}.> To offend and iudge are distinct offices,
1174   And of opposed natures.
1175   <S {Ar}.> What is here?
1176   {The fier seauen times tried this},
1177   {Seauen times tried that iudgement is},
1178   {That did neuer choose amis},
1179   {Some there be that shadowes kisse},
1180   {Such haue but a shadowes blisse:}
1181   {There be fooles aliue Iwis}
1182   {Siluer'd o're, and so was this:}
1183   {Take what wife you will to bed},
1184   {I will euer be your head:}
1185   {So be gone, you are sped}.
1186   <S {Ar}.> Still more foole I shall appeare
1187   By the time I linger here,
1188   With one fooles head I came to woo,
1189   But I goe away with two.
1190   Sweet adue, Ile keepe my oath,
1191   Patiently to beare my wroath.
1192   <S {Por}.> Thus hath the candle sing'd the moath:
1193   O these deliberate fooles when they doe choose,
1194   They haue the wisdome by their wit to loose.
1195   <S {Ner}.> The ancient saying is no heresie,
1196   Hanging and wiuing goes by destinie.
1197   <S {Por}.> Come draw the curtaine {Nerrissa}.
1198   <D {Enter Messenger}.>
1199   <S {Mes}.> Where is my Lady?
1200   <S {Por}.> Here, what would my Lord?
1201   <S {Mes}.> Madam, there is a- lighted at your gate
1202   A yong Venetian, one that comes before
1203   To signifie th' approaching of his Lord,
1204   From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
1205   To wit (besides commends and curteous breath)
1206   Gifts of rich value; yet I haue not seene
1207   So likely an Embassador of loue.
1208   A day in Aprill neuer came so sweete
1209   To show how costly Sommer was at hand,
1210   As this fore- spurrer comes before his Lord.
1211   <S {Por}.> No more I pray thee, I am halfe a- feard
1212   Thou wilt say anone he is some kin to thee,
1213   Thou spend'st such high- day wit in praising him:
1214   Come, come {Nerryssa}, for I long to see
1215   Quicke {Cupids} Post, that comes so mannerly.
1216   <S {Ner}.> {Bassanio} Lord, loue if thy #will it be.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1217   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1218   <D {Enter Solanio and Salarino}.>
1219   <S {Sol}.> Now, what newes on the Ryalto?
1220  *<S {Sal}.> Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that {Anthonio}
1221  *hath a ship of rich lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the
1222  *Goodwins I thinke they call the place, a very dangerous
1223  *flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many a tall ship, lye
1224  *buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an honest wo-man
1225   of her word.
1226  *<S {Sol}.> I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as euer
1227  *knapt Ginger, or made her neighbours beleeue she wept
1228  *for the death of a third husband: but it is true, without
1229  *any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plaine high- way of
1230  *talke, that the good {Anthonio}, the honest {Anthonio}; o that
1231   I had a title good enough to keepe his name company!
1232   <S {Sal}.> Come, the full stop.
1233  *<S {Sol}.> Ha, what sayest thou, why the end is, he hath lost
1234   a ship.
      <P P3>
1235   <S {Sal}.> I would it might proue the end of his losses.
1236  *<S {Sol}.> Let me say Amen betimes, least the diuell crosse
1237  *my praier, for here he comes in the likenes of a {Iew}. How
1238   now {Shylocke}, what newes among the Merchants?
1239   <D {Enter Shylocke}.>
1240  *<S {Shy}.> You knew none so well, none so well as you, of
1241   my daughters flight.
1242  *<S {Sal}.> That's certaine, I for my part knew the Tailor
1243   that made the wings she flew withall.
1244  *<S {Sol}.> And {Shylocke} for his owne part knew the bird was
1245  *fledg'd, and then it is the complexion of them al to leaue
1246   the dam.
1247   <S {Shy}.> She is damn'd for it.
1248   <S {Sal}.> That's certaine, if the diuell may be her Iudge.
1249   <S {Shy}.> My owne flesh and blood to rebell.
1250  *<S {Sol}.> Out vpon it old carrion, rebels it at these yeeres.
1251   <S {Shy}.> I say my daughter is my flesh and bloud.
1252  *<S {Sal}.> There is more difference betweene thy flesh and
1253  *hers, then betweene Iet and Iuorie, more betweene your
1254  *bloods, then there is betweene red wine and rennish: but
1255  *tell vs, doe you heare whether {Anthonio} haue had anie
1256   losse at sea or no?
1257  *<S {Shy}.> There I haue another bad match, a bankrout, a
1258  *prodigall, who dare scarce shew his head on the Ryalto,
1259  *a begger that was vsd to come so smug vpon the Mart:
1260  *let him look to his bond, he was wont to call me Vsurer,
1261  *let him looke to his bond, he was wont to lend money
1262   for a Christian curtsie, let him looke to his bond.
1263  *<S {Sal}.> Why I am sure if he forfaite, thou wilt not take
1264   his flesh, what's that good for?
1265  *<S {Shy}.> To baite fish withall, if it will feede nothing
1266  *else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
1267  *hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
1268  *my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
1269  *cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
1270  *reason? I am a {Iewe}: Hath not a {Iew} eyes? hath not a
1271  *{#Iew} hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passi-ons,
1272  *fed with the same foode, hurt with the same wea-pons,
1273  *subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
1274  *meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
1275  *Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
1276  *bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
1277  *vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not re-uenge?
1278  *if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
1279  *in that. If a {Iew} wrong a {Christian}, what is his humility,
1280  *reuenge? If a {Christian} wrong a {Iew}, what should his suf-ferance
1281  *be by Christian example, why reuenge? The vil-lanie
1282  *you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
1283   but I will better the instruction.
1284   <D {Enter a man from} Anthonio.>
1285  *Gentlemen, my maister {Anthonio} is at his house, and
1286   desires to speake with you both.
1287   <S {Sal}.> We haue beene vp and downe to seeke him.
1288   <D {Enter} Tuball.>
1289  *<S {Sol}.> Here comes another of the Tribe, a third cannot
1290   be matcht, vnlesse the diuell himselfe turne {Iew}.
1291   <D {Exeunt Gentlemen}.>
1292  *<S {Shy}.> How now {Tuball}, what newes from {Genowa}? hast
1293   thou found my daughter?
1294  *<S {Tub}.> I often came where I did heare of her, but can-not
1295   finde her.
1296  *<S {Shy}.> Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
1297  *cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse ne-uer
1298  *fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
1299  *two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, preci-ous
1300  *iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
1301  *and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
1302  *foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
1303  *why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
1304  *why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
1305  *much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfa-ction,
1306  *no reuenge, nor no #ill luck stirring but what lights
1307  *#a my shoulders, no sighes but #a my breathing, no teares
1308   but #a my shedding.
1309  *<S {Tub}.> Yes, other men haue #ill lucke too, {Anthonio} as I
1310   heard in Genowa?
1311   <S {Shy}.> What, what, what, #ill lucke, #ill lucke.
1312  *<S {Tub}.> Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tri-polis.
1313  _
1314  *<S {Shy}.> I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?
1315  *<S {Tub}.> I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped
1316   the wracke.
1317  *<S {Shy}.> I thanke thee good {Tuball}, good newes, good
1318   newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa.
1319  *<S {Tub}.> Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one
1320   night fourescore ducats.
1321  *<S {Shy}.> Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my
1322  *gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore du-cats.
1323  _
1324  *<S {Tub}.> There came diuers of {Anthonios} creditors in my
1325  *company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
1326   breake.
1327  *<S {Shy}.> I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture
1328   him, I am glad of it,
1329  *<S {Tub}.> One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of
1330   your daughter for a Monkie.
1331  *<S {Shy}.> Out vpon her, thou torturest me {Tuball}, it was
1332  *my Turkies, I had it of {Leah} when I was a Batcheler: I
1333   would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies.
1334   <S {Tub}.> But {Anthonio} is certainely vndone.
1335  *<S {Shy}.> Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe {Tuball}, see
1336  *me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
1337  *haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Ve-nice,
1338  *I can make what merchandize I will: goe {Tuball},
1339  *and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good {Tuball}, at our
1340   Sinagogue {Tuball}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1341   <D {Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine}.>
1342   <S {Por}.> I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two
1343   Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
1344   I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,
1345   There's something tels me (but it is not loue)
1346   I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,
1347   Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;
1348   But least you should not vnderstand me well,
1349   And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,
1350   I would detaine you here some month or two
1351   Before you venture for me. I could teach you
1352   How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,
1353   So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,
1354   But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,
1355   That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,
1356   They haue ore- lookt me and deuided me,
1357   One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,
1358   Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,
1359   And so all yours; O these naughtie times
1360   Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.
1361   And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)
1362   Let Fortune goe to #hell for it, not I.
1363   I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
1364   To ich it, and to draw it out in length,
1365   To stay you from election.
      <P P3v>
1366   <S {Bass}.> Let me choose,
1367   For as I am, I liue vpon the racke.
1368   <S {Por}.> Vpon the racke {Bassanio}, then confesse
1369   What treason there is mingled with your loue.
1370   <S {Bass}.> None but that vglie treason of mistrust.
1371   Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:
1372   There may as well be amitie and life,
1373   'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue.
1374   <S {Por}.> #I, but I feare you speake vpon the racke,
1375   Where men enforced doth speake any thing.
1376   <S {Bass}.> Promise me life, and ile confesse the truth.
1377   <S {Por}.> Well then, confesse and liue.
1378   <S {Bass}.> Confesse and loue
1379   Had beene the verie sum of my confession:
1380   O happie torment, when my torturer
1381   Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:
1382   But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
1383   <S {Por}.> Away then, I am lockt in one of them,
1384   If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.
1385   {#Nerryssa} and the rest, stand all aloofe,
1386   Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,
1387   Then if he loose he makes a Swan- like end,
1388   Fading in musique. That the comparison
1389   May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame
1390   And watrie death- bed for him: he may win,
1391   And what is musique than? Than musique is
1392   Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe
1393   To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,
1394   As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,
1395   That creepe into the dreaming bride- groomes eare,
1396   And summon him to marriage. Now he goes
1397   With no lesse presence, but with much more loue
1398   Then yong {Alcides}, when he did redeeme
1399   The virgine tribute, paied by howling {Troy}
1400   To the Sea- monster: I stand for sacrifice,
1401   The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:
1402   With bleared visages come forth to view
1403   The issue of th' exploit: Goe Hercules,
1404   Liue thou, I liue with much more dismay
1405   I view the sight, then thou that mak'st the fray.
1406   <D {Here Musicke}.

1409   {Tell me where is fancie bred},
1410   {Or in the heart, or in the head:}
1411   {How begot, how nourished.  Replie, replie}.
1412   {It is engendred in the eyes},
1413   {With gazing fed, and Fancie dies},

1416   Ile begin it.
1417   {Ding, dong, bell}.
1418   <S All.> {Ding, dong, bell}.
1419  *<S {Bass}.> So may the outward showes be least themselues
1420   The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.
1421   In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,
1422   But being season'd with a gracious voice,
1423   Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,
1424   What damned error, but some sober brow
1425   Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,
1426   Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:
1427   There is no voice so simple, but assumes
1428   Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;
1429   How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false
1430   As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins
1431   The beards of {Hercules} and frowning {Mars},
1432   Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,
1433   And these assume but valors excrement,
1434   To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,
1435   And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,
1436   Which therein workes a miracle in nature,
1437   Making them lightest that weare most of it:
1438   So are those crisped snakie golden locks
1439   Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde
1440   Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne
1441   To be the dowrie of a second head,
1442   The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.
1443   Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
1444   To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe
1445   Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,
1446   The seeming truth which cunning times put on
1447  *To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,
1448   Hard food for {Midas}, I will none of thee,
1449   Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
1450   'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead
1451   Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,
1452   Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,
1453   And here choose I, ioy be the consequence.
1454   <S {Por}.> How all the other passions fleet to ayre,
1455   As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:
1456   And shuddring feare, and greene- eyed iealousie.
1457   O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,
1458   In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,
1459   I feele too much thy blessing, make it lesse,
1460   For feare I surfeit.
1461   <S {Bas}.> What finde I here?
1462   Faire {Portias} counterfeit. What demie God
1463   Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?
1464   Or whether riding on the bals of mine
1465   Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips
1466   Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre
1467   Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires
1468   The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen
1469   A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men
1470   Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,
1471   How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,
1472   Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his
1473   And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre
1474   The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
1475   In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow
1476   Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,
1477   The continent, and summarie of my fortune.
1478   {You that choose not by the view}

1483   {And hold your fortune for your blisse},
1484   {Turne you where your Lady is},
1485   {And claime her with a louing kisse}.
1486   <S {Bass}.> A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,
1487   I come by note to giue, and to receiue,
1488   Like one of two contending in a prize
1489   That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:
1490   Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,
1491   Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
1492   Whether those peales of praise be his or no.
      <P P4><C C>
1493   So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,
1494   As doubtfull whether what I see be true,
1495   Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
1496   <S {Por}.> You see my Lord {Bassiano} where I stand,
1497   Such as I am; though for my selfe alone
1498   I would not be ambitious in my wish,
1499   To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,
1500   I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,
1501   A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times
1502   More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,
1503   I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,
1504   Exceed account: but the full summe of me
1505   Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,
1506   Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,
1507   Happy in this, she is not yet so old
1508   But she may learne: happier then this,
1509   Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;
1510   Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
1511   Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,
1512   As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.
1513   My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours
1514   Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord
1515   Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,
1516   Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,
1517   This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe
1518   Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,
1519   Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,
1520   Let it presage the ruine of your loue,
1521   And be my vantage to exclaime on you.
1522   <S {Bass}.> Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,
1523   Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,
1524   And there is such confusion in my powers,
1525   As after some oration fairely spoke
1526   By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare
1527   Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
1528   Where euery something being blent together,
1529   Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy
1530   Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring
1531   Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,
1532   O then be bold to say {Bassanio}'s dead.
1533   <S {Ner}.> My Lord and Lady, it is now our time
1534   That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,
1535   To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady.
1536   <S {Gra}.> My Lord {Bassanio}, and my gentle Lady,
1537   I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:
1538   For I am sure you can wish none from me:
1539   And when your Honours meane to solemnize
1540   The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you
1541   Euen at that time I may be married too.
1542   <S {Bass}.> With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
1543  *<S {Gra}.> I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.
1544   My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:
1545   You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:
1546   You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,
1547   No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;
1548   Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,
1549   And so did mine too, as the matter falls:
1550   For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,
1551   And swearing till my very rough was dry
1552   With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,
1553   I got a promise of this faire one heere
1554   To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune
1555   Atchieu'd her mistresse.
1556   <S {Por}.> Is this true {Nerrissa}?
1557   <S {Ner}.> Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall.
1558   <S {Bass}.> And doe you {Gratiano} meane good faith?
1559   <S {Gra}.> Yes faith my Lord.
1560  *<S {Bass}.> Our feast shall be much honored in your mar-riage.
1561  _
1562  *<S {Gra}.> Weele play with them the first boy for a thou-sand
1563   ducats.
1564   <S {Ner}.> What and stake downe?
1565   <S {Gra}.> No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake
1566   downe.
1567   But who comes heere? {Lorenzo} and his Infidell?
1568   What and my old Venetian friend {Salerio}?
1569   <D {Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio}.>
1570   <S {Bas}.> {Lorenzo} and {Salerio}, welcome hether,
1571   If that the youth of my new interest heere
1572   Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue
1573   I bid my verie friends and Countrimen
1574   Sweet {Portia} welcome.
1575   <S {Por}.> So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome.
1576   <S {Lor}.> I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,
1577   My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,
1578   But meeting with {Salerio} by the way,
1579   He did intreate mee past all saying nay
1580   To come with him along.
1581   <S {Sal}.> I did my Lord,
1582   And I haue reason for it, Signior {Anthonio}
1583   Commends him to you.
1584   <S {Bass}.> Ere I ope his Letter
1585   I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
1586   <S {Sal}.> Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,
1587   Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there
1588   Wil shew you his estate.
1589   <D {Opens the Letter}.>
1590  *<S {Gra}.> {Nerrissa}, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.
1591   Your hand {Salerio}, what's the newes from Venice?
1592   How doth that royal Merchant good {Anthonio};
1593   I know he will be glad of our successe,
1594   We are the {Iasons}, we haue won the fleece.
1595  *<S {Sal}.> I would you had won the fleece that hee hath
1596   lost.
1597  *<S {Por}.> There are some shrewd contents in yond same
1598   Paper,
1599   That steales the colour from {Bassianos} cheeke,
1600   Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world
1601   Could turne so much the constitution
1602   Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?
1603   With leaue {Bassanio} I am halfe your selfe,
1604   And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing
1605   That this same paper brings you.
1606   <S {Bass}.> O sweet {Portia},
1607   Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words
1608   That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie
1609   When I did first impart my loue to you,
1610   I freely told you all the wealth I had
1611   Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,
1612   And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,
1613   Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see
1614   How much I was a Braggart, when I told you
1615   My state was nothing, I should then haue told you
1616   That I was worse then nothing: for indeede
1617   I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,
1618   Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie
1619   To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,
1620   The paper as the bodie of my friend,
1621   And euerie word in it a gaping wound
1622   Issuing life blood. But is it true {Salerio},
      <P P4v>
1623   Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,
1624   From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
1625   From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
1626   And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch
1627   Of Merchant- marring rocks?
1628   <S {Sal}.> Not one my Lord.
1629   Besides, it should appeare, that if he had
1630   The present money to discharge the Iew,
1631   He would not take it: neuer did I know
1632   A creature that did beare the shape of man
1633   So keene and greedy to confound a man.
1634   He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,
1635   And doth impeach the freedome of the state
1636   If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,
1637   The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes
1638   Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,
1639   But none can driue him from the enuious plea
1640   Of  forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond.
1641  *<S {Iessi}.> When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare
1642   To {Tuball} and to {Chus}, his Countri- men,
1643   That he would rather haue {Anthonio's} flesh,
1644   Then twenty times the value of the summe
1645   That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,
1646   If law, authoritie, and power denie not,
1647   It will goe hard with poore {Anthonio}.
1648   <S {Por}.> Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?
1649   <S {Bass}.> The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,
1650   The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit
1651   In doing curtesies: and one in whom
1652   The ancient Romane honour more appeares
1653   Then any that drawes breath in Italie.
1654   <S {Por}.> What summe owes he the Iew?
1655   <S {Bass}.> For me three thousand ducats.
1656   <S {Por}.> What, no more?
1657   Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:
1658   Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,
1659   Before a friend of this description
1660   Shall lose a haire through {Bassanio's} fault.
1661   First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,
1662   And then away to Venice to your friend:
1663   For neuer shall you lie by {Portias} side
1664   With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold
1665   To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.
1666   When it is payd, bring your true friend along,
1667   My maid {Nerrissa}, and my selfe meane time
1668   Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,
1669   For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:
1670   Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,
1671   Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.
1672   But let me heare the letter of your friend.
1673  *{Sweet} Bassanio, {my ships haue all miscarried, my Credi-tors}
1674  *{grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is}
1675  *{forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all}
1676  *{debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my}
1677  *{death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not}
1678   {perswade you to come, let not my letter}.
1679   <S {Por}.> O loue! dispach all busines and be gone.
1680   <S {Bass}.> Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,
1681   I will make #hast; but till I come againe,
1682   No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,
1683   Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1684   <D {Enter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio},
1685   {and the Iaylor}.>
1686   <S {Iew}.> Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,
1687   This is the foole that lends out money {gratis}.
1688   Iaylor, looke to him.
1689   <S {Ant}.> Heare me yet good {Shylok}.
1690  *<S {Iew}.> Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,
1691   I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:
1692   Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
1693   But since I am a dog, beware my phangs,
1694   The Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder
1695   Thou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond
1696   To come abroad with him at his request.
1697   <S {Ant}.> I pray thee heare me speake.
1698  *<S {Iew}.> Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,
1699   Ile haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,
1700   Ile not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,
1701   To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld
1702   To Christian intercessors: follow not,
1703   Ile haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.  <D {Exit Iew}.>
1704   <S {Sol}.> It is the most impenetrable curre
1705   That euer kept with men.
1706   <S {Ant}.> Let him alone,
1707   Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:
1708   He seekes my life, his reason well I know;
1709   I oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures
1710   Many that haue at times made mone to me,
1711   Therefore he hates me.
1712   <S {Sol}.> I am sure the Duke will neuer grant
1713   this forfeiture to hold.
1714   <S {An}.> The Duke cannot deny the course of law:
1715   For the commoditie that strangers haue
1716   With vs in Venice, if it be denied,
1717   Will much impeach the iustice of the State,
1718   Since that the trade and profit of the citty
1719   Consisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,
1720   These greefes and losses haue so bated mee,
1721   That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
1722   To morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.
1723   Well Iaylor, on, pray God {Bassanio} come
1724   To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1725  *<D {Enter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of}
1726   {Portias}.>
1727  *<S {Lor}.> Madam, although I speake it in your presence,
1728   You haue a noble and a true conceit
1729   Of god- like amity, which appeares most strongly
1730   In bearing thus the absence of your Lord.
1731   But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,
1732   How true a Gentleman you send releefe,
1733   How deere a louer of my Lord your husband,
1734   I know you would be prouder of the worke
1735   Then customary bounty can enforce you.
1736   <S {Por}.> I neuer did repent for doing good,
1737   Nor shall not now: for in companions
1738   That do conuerse and waste the time together,
1739   Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.
1740   There must be needs a like proportion
1741   Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;
1742   Which makes me thinke that this {Anthonio}
1743   Being the bosome louer of my Lord,
1744   Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,
1745   How little is the cost I haue bestowed
1746   In purchasing the semblance of my soule;
1747   From out the state of hellish cruelty,
1748   This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,
1749   Therefore no more of it: heere other things
1750   {#Lorenso} I commit into your hands,
      <P P5>
1751   The husbandry and mannage of my house,
1752   Vntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part
1753   I haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,
1754   To liue in prayer and contemplation,
1755   Onely attended by {Nerrissa} heere,
1756   Vntill her husband and my Lords returne:
1757   There is a monastery #too miles off,
1758   And there we  will abide. I doe desire you
1759   Not to denie this imposition,
1760   The which my loue and some necessity
1761   Now layes vpon you.
1762   <S {Lorens}.> Madame, with all my heart,
1763   I shall obey you in all faire commands.
1764   <S {Por}.> My people doe already know my minde,
1765   And will acknowledge you and {Iessica}
1766   In place of Lord {Bassanio} and my selfe.
1767   So far you well till we shall meete againe.
1768  *<S {Lor}.> Faire thoughts & happy houres attend on you.
1769   <S {Iessi}.> I wish your Ladiship all hearts content.
1770  *<S {Por}.> I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
1771   To wish it backe on you: faryouwell {Iessica}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1772   Now {Balthaser}, as I haue euer found thee honest true,
1773   So let me finde thee still: take this same letter,
1774   And vse thou all the indeauor of a man,
1775   In speed to Mantua, see thou render this
1776   Into my cosins hand, Doctor {Belario},
1777  *And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,
1778   Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed
1779   Vnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie
1780   Which trades to Venice; waste no time in words,
1781   But get thee gone, I shall be there before thee.
1782   <S {Balth}.> Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed.
1783   <S {Por}.> Come on {Nerissa}, I haue worke in hand
1784   That you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands
1785   Before they thinke of vs?
1786   <S {Nerrissa}.> Shall they see vs?
1787   <S {Portia}.> They shall {Nerrissa}: but in such a habit,
1788   That they shall thinke we are accomplished
1789   With that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager
1790   When we are both accoutered like yong men,
1791   Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two,
1792   And weare my dagger with the brauer grace,
1793   And speake betweene the change of man and boy,
1794   With a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps
1795   Into a manly stride; and speake of frayes
1796   Like a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes
1797   How honourable Ladies sought my loue,
1798   Which I denying, they fell sicke and died.
1799   I could not doe withall: then Ile repent,
1800   And wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;
1801   And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,
1802   That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole
1803   Aboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde
1804   A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,
1805   Which I will practise.
1806   <S {Nerris}.> Why, shall wee turne to men?
1807   <S {Portia}.> Fie, what a questions that?
1808   If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:
1809   But come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice
1810   When I am in my coach, which stayes for vs
1811   At the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,
1812   For we must measure twentie miles to day.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1813   <D {Enter Clowne and Iessica}.>
1814  *<S {Clown}.> Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Fa-ther
1815  *are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise
1816  *you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so
1817  *now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of
1818  *good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is
1819  *but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is
1820   but a kinde of bastard hope neither.
1821   <S {Iessica}.> And what hope is that I pray thee?
1822  *<S {Clow}.> Marrie you may partlie hope that your father
1823   got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter.
1824  *<S {Ies}.> That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the
1825   sins of my mother should be visited vpon me.
1826  *<S {Clow}.> Truly then I feare you are damned both by fa-ther
1827  *and mother: thus when I shun {Scilla} your father, I
1828  *fall into {Charibdis} your mother; well, you are gone both
1829   waies.
1830  *<S {Ies}.> I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me
1831   a Christian.
1832   <S {Clow}.> Truly the more to blame he, we were Christi-ans
1833  *enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by a-nother:
1834  *this making of Christians will raise the price of
1835  *Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke- eaters, wee shall not
1836   shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.
1837   <D {Enter Lorenzo}.>
1838  *<S {Ies}.> Ile tell my husband {Lancelet} what you say, heere
1839   he comes.
1840  *<S {Loren}.> I shall grow iealous of you shortly {Lancelet},
1841   if you thus get my wife into corners?
1842  *<S {Ies}.> Nay, you need not feare vs {Lorenzo, Launcelet}
1843  *and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee
1844  *in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
1845  *you are no good member of the common wealth, for
1846  *in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
1847   of Porke.
1848  *<S {Loren}.> I shall answere that better to the Common-wealth,
1849  *than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bel-lie:
1850   the Moore is with childe by you {Launcelet}?
1851  *<S {Clow}.> It is much that the Moore should be more then
1852  *reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is
1853   indeed more then I tooke her for.
1854  *<S {Loren}.> How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I
1855  *thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into si-lence,
1856  *and discourse grow commendable in none onely
1857   but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?
1858   <S {Clow}.> That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?
1859  *<S {Loren}.> Goodly Lord, what a witte- snapper are you,
1860   then bid them prepare dinner.
1861   <S {Clow}.> That is done #to sir, onely couer is the word.
1862   <S {Loren}.> Will you couer than sir?
1863   <S {Clow}.> Not so sir neither, I know my dutie.
1864  *<S {Loren}.> Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou
1865  *shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray
1866  *thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe
1867  *to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the
1868   meat, and we will come in to dinner.
1869  *<S {Clow}.> For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the
1870  *meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to
1871  *dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall go-uerne.
1872   <D {Exit Clowne}.>
1873   <S {Lor}.> O deare discretion, how his words are suted,
1874   The foole hath planted in his memory
1875   An Armie of good words, and I doe know
1876   #A many fooles that stand in better place,
1877   Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word
1878   Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou {Iessica},
1879   And now good sweet say thy opinion,
      <P P5v>
1880   How dost thou like the Lord {Bassiano's} wife?
1881   <S {Iessi}.> Past all expressing, it is very meete
1882   The Lord {Bassanio} liue an vpright life
1883   For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,
1884   He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,
1885   And if on earth he doe not meane it, it
1886   Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?
1887   Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,
1888   And on the wager lay two earthly women,
1889   And {Portia} one: there must be something else
1890   Paund with the other, for the poore rude world
1891   Hath not her fellow.
1892   <S {Loren}.> Euen such a husband
1893   Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife.
1894   <S {Ies}.> Nay, but aske my opinion #to of that?
1895   <S {Lor}.> I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?
1896  *<S {Ies}.> Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?
1897   <S {Lor}.> No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,
1898   Then how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,
1899   I shall digest it?
1900   <S {Iessi}.> Well, Ile set you forth.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1901   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1902  *<D {Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Anthonio, Bassanio, and}
1903   {Gratiano}.>
1904   <S {Duke}.> What, is {Anthonio} heere?
1905   <S {Ant}.> Ready, so please your grace?
1906   <S {Duke}.> I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere
1907   A stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,
1908   Vncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty
1909   From any dram of mercie.
1910   <S {Ant}.> I haue heard
1911   Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie
1912   His rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,
1913   And that no lawful meanes can carrie me
1914   Out of his enuies reach, I do oppose
1915   My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
1916   To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,
1917   The very tiranny and rage of his.
1918   <S {Du}.> Go one and cal the Iew into the Court.
1919   <S {Sal}.> He is ready at the doore, he comes my Lord.
1920   <D {Enter Shylocke}.>
1921   <S {Du}.> Make roome, and let him stand before our face.
1922   {#Shylocke} the world thinkes, and I thinke so #to
1923   That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice
1924   To the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought
1925   Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,
1926   Than is thy strange apparant cruelty;
1927   And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
1928   Which is a pound of this poore Merchants   flesh,
1929   Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,
1930   But touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:
1931   Forgiue a moytie of the principall,
1932   Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses
1933   That haue of late so hudled on his backe,
1934   Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe;
1935   And plucke commiseration of his state
1936   From brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,
1937   From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind
      <C B>
1938   To offices of tender curtesie,
1939   We all expect a gentle answer Iew?
1940   <S {Iew}.> I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,
1941   And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne
1942   To haue the due and forfeit of my bond.
1943   If you denie it, let the danger light
1944   Vpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.
1945   You'l aske me why I rather choose to haue
1946   A weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue
1947   Three thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:
1948   But say it is my humor; Is it answered?
1949   What if my house be troubled with a Rat,
1950   And I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates
1951   To haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?
1952   Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:
1953   Some that are mad, if they behold a Cat:
1954   And others, when the bag- pipe sings i'th nose,
1955   Cannot containe their Vrine for affection.
1956   Masters of passion swayes it to the moode
1957   Of what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:
1958   As there is no firme reason to be rendred
1959   Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?
1960   Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?
1961   Why he a woollen bag- pipe: but of force
1962   Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,
1963   As to offend himselfe being offended:
1964   So can I giue no reason, nor I will not,
1965   More then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing
1966   I beare {Anthonio}, that I follow thus
1967   A loosing suite against him? Are you answered?
1968   <S {Bass}.> This is no answer thou vnfeeling man,
1969   To excuse the currant of thy cruelty.
1970  *<S {Iew}.> I am not bound to please thee with my answer.
1971   <S {Bass}.> Do all men kil the things they do not loue?
1972   <S {Iew}.> Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
1973   <S {Bass}.> Euerie offence is not a hate at first.
1974  *<S {Iew}.> What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee
1975   twice?
1976  *<S {Ant}.> I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:
1977   You may as well go stand vpon the beach,
1978   And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,
1979   Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,
1980   The Ewe bleate for the Lambe:
1981   You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines
1982   To wagge their high tops, and to make no noise
1983   When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:
1984   You may as well do any thing most hard,
1985   As seeke to soften that, then which what harder?
1986   His Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you
1987   Make no more offers, vse no farther meanes,
1988   But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie
1989   Let me haue iudgement, and the Iew his #will.
1990   <S {Bas}.> For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six.
1991   <S {Iew}.> If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates
1992   Were in sixe parts, and euery part a Ducate,
1993   I would not draw them, I would haue my bond?
1994  *<S {Du}.> How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?
1995  *<S {Iew}.> What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?
1996   You haue among you many a purchast slaue,
1997   Which like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,
1998   You vse in abiect and in slauish parts,
1999   Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,
2000   Let them be free, marrie them to your heires?
2001   Why sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds
2002   Be made as soft as yours: and let their pallats
2003   Be season'd with such Viands: you will answer
      <P P6>
2004   The slaues are ours. So do I answer you.
2005   The pound of flesh which I demand of him
2006   Is deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.
2007   If you deny me; fie vpon your Law,
2008   There is no force in the decrees of Venice;
2009   I stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?
2010   <S {Du}.> Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court,
2011   Vnlesse {Bellario} a learned Doctor,
2012   Whom I haue sent for to determine this,
2013   Come heere to day.
2014   <S {Sal}.> My Lord, heere stayes without
2015   A Messenger with Letters from the Doctor,
2016   New come from Padua.
2017   <S {Du}.> Bring vs the Letters, Call the Messengers.
2018  *<S {Bass}.> Good cheere {Anthonio}. What man, corage yet:
2019   The Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
2020   Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood.
2021   <S {Ant}.> I am a tainted Weather of the flocke,
2022   Meetest for death, the weakest kinde of fruite
2023   Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;
2024   You cannot better be employ'd {Bassanio},
2025   Then to liue still, and write mine Epitaph.
2026   <D {Enter Nerrissa}.>
2027   <S {Du}.> Came you from Padua from {Bellario}?
2028   <S {Ner}.> From both.
2029   My Lord {Bellario} greets your Grace.
2030   <S {Bas}.> Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
2031  *<S {Iew}.> To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there.
2032   <S {Gra}.> Not on thy soale: but on thy soule harsh Iew
2033   Thou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,
2034   No, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse
2035   Of thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
2036   <S {Iew}.> No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
2037   <S {Gra}.> O be thou damn'd, inexecrable dogge,
2038   And for thy life let iustice be accus'd:
2039   Thou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;
2040   To hold opinion with {Pythagoras},
2041   That soules of Animals infuse themselues
2042   Into the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit
2043   Gouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,
2044   Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;
2045   And whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,
2046   Infus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires
2047   Are Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous.
2048  *<S {Iew}.> Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond
2049   Thou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:
2050   Repaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall
2051   To endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law.
2052   <S {Du}.> This Letter from {Bellario} doth commend
2053   A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;
2054   Where is he?
2055   <S {Ner}.> He attendeth heere hard by
2056   To know your answer, whether you'l admit him.
2057   <S {Du}.> With all my heart. Some three or four of you
2058   Go giue him curteous conduct to this place,
2059   Meane time the Court shall heare {Bellarioes} Letter.
2060  *{Your Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your}
2061  *{Letter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your mes-senger}
2062  *{came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Do-ctor}
2063  *{of Rome, his name is} Balthasar: {I acquainted him with}
2064  *{the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and} Anthonio
2065  *{the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is}
2066  *{furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne lear-ning},
2067  *{the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes}
2068  *{with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in}
2069  *{my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment}
2070  *{to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so}
2071  *{yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious}
2072  *{acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation}.
2073   <D {Enter Portia for Balthazar}.>
2074  *<S {Duke}.> You heare the learn'd {Bellario} what he writes,
2075   And heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.
2076   Giue me your hand: Came you from old {Bellario}?
2077   <S {Por}.> I did my Lord.
2078   <S {Du}.> You are welcome: take your place;
2079   Are you acquainted with the difference
2080   That holds this present question in the Court.
2081   <S {Por}.> I am enformed throughly of the cause.
2082   Which is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?
2083   <S {Du}.> {Anthonio} and old {Shylocke}, both stand forth.
2084   <S {Por}.> Is your name {Shylocke}?
2085   <S {Iew}.> {Shylocke} is my name.
2086   <S {Por}.> Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,
2087   Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law
2088   Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.
2089   You stand within his danger, do you not?
2090   <S {Ant}.> #I, so he sayes.
2091   <S {Por}.> Do you confesse the bond?
2092   <S {Ant}.> I do.
2093   <S {Por}.> Then must the Iew be mercifull.
2094   <S {Iew}.> On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that.
2095   <S {Por}.> The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
2096   It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen
2097   Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,
2098   It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,
2099   'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes
2100   The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.
2101   His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,
2102   The attribute to awe and Maiestie,
2103   Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:
2104   But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,
2105   It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,
2106   It is an attribute to God himselfe;
2107   And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods
2108   When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,
2109   Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,
2110   That in the course of Iustice, none of vs
2111   Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,
2112   And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render
2113   The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much
2114   To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:
2115   Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice
2116   Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there.
2117   <S {Shy}.> My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,
2118   The penaltie and forfeite of my bond.
2119   <S {Por}.> Is he not able to discharge the money?
2120   <S {Bas}.> Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,
2121   Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,
2122   I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,
2123   On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
2124   If this will not suffice, it must appeare
2125   That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you
2126   Wrest once the Law to your authority.
2127   To do a great right, do a little wrong,
2128   And curbe this cruell diuell of his #will.
2129   <S {Por}.> It must not be, there is no power in Venice
2130   Can alter a decree established:
2131   'Twill be recorded for a President,
      <P P6v>
2132   And many an error by the same example,
2133   Will rush into the state: It cannot be.
2134   <S {Iew}.> A {Daniel} come to iudgement, yea a {Daniel}.
2135   O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee.
2136   <S {Por}.> I pray you let me looke vpon the bond.
2137   <S {Iew}.> Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is.
2138   <S {Por}.> {Shylocke}, there's thrice thy monie offered thee.
2139   <S {Shy}.> An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:
2140   Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?
2141   No not for Venice.
2142   <S {Por}.> Why this bond is forfeit,
2143   And lawfully by this the Iew may claime
2144   A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
2145   Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,
2146   Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond.
2147   <S {Iew}.> When it is paid according to the tenure.
2148   It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:
2149   You know the Law, your exposition
2150   Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,
2151   Whereof you are a well- deseruing pillar,
2152   Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,
2153   There is no power in the tongue of man
2154   To alter me: I stay heere on my bond.
2155   <S {An}.> Most heartily I do beseech the Court
2156   To giue the iudgement.
2157   <S {Por}.> Why then thus it is:
2158   You must prepare your bosome for his knife.
2159   <S {Iew}.> O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man.
2160   <S {Por}.> For the intent and purpose of the Law
2161   Hath full relation to the penaltie,
2162   Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond.
2163   <S {Iew}.> 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,
2164   How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?
2165   <S {Por}.> Therefore lay bare your bosome.
2166   <S {Iew}.> #I, his brest,
2167   So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?
2168   Neerest his heart, those are the very words.
2169  *<S {Por}.> It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the
2170   flesh?
2171   <S {Iew}.> I haue them ready.
2172  *<S {Por}.> Haue by some Surgeon {Shylock} on your charge
2173   To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death.
2174   <S {Iew}.> It is not nominated in the bond?
2175   <S {Por}.> It is not so exprest: but what of that?
2176   'Twere good you do so much for charitie.
2177   <S {Iew}.> I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond.
2178   <S {Por}.> Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?
2179   <S {Ant}.> But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
2180   Giue me your hand {Bassanio}, fare you well.
2181   Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:
2182   For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde
2183   Then is her custome. It is still her vse
2184   To let the wretched man out- liue his wealth,
2185   To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow
2186   An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance
2187   Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:
2188   Commend me to your honourable Wife,
2189   Tell her the processe of {Anthonio's} end:
2190   Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:
2191   And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,
2192   Whether {Bassanio} had not once a Loue:
2193   Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,
2194   And he repents not that he payes your debt.
2195   For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,
2196   Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart.
2197   <S {Bas}.> {Anthonio}, I am married to a wife,
      <C C>
2198   Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,
2199   But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,
2200   Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.
2201   I would loose all, #I sacrifice them all
2202   Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you.
2203  *<S {Por}.> Your wife would giue you little thanks for that
2204   If she were by to heare you make the offer.
2205   <S {Gra}.> I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,
2206   I would she were in heauen, so she could
2207   Intreat some power to change this currish Iew.
2208   <S {Ner}.> 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,
2209   The wish would make else an vnquiet house.
2210  *<S {Iew}.> These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daugh-|(ter
2211   Would any of the stocke of {Barrabas}
2212   Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.
2213   We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence.
2214   <S {Por}.> A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,
2215   The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it.
2216   <S {Iew}.> Most rightfull Iudge.
2217   <S {Por}.> And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,
2218   The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it.
2219   <S {Iew}.> Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare.
2220   <S {Por}.> Tarry a little, there is something else,
2221   This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,
2222   The words expresly are a pound of flesh:
2223   Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
2224   But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
2225   One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods
2226   Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate
2227   Vnto the state of Venice.
2228   <S {Gra}.> O vpright Iudge,
2229   Marke Iew, o learned Iudge.
2230   <S {Shy}.> Is that the law?
2231   <S {Por}.> Thy selfe shalt see the Act:
2232   For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd
2233   Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest.
2234   <S {Gra}.> O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge.
2235   <S {Iew}.> I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,
2236   And let the Christian goe.
2237   <S {Bass}.> Heere is the money.
2238  *<S {Por}.> Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,
2239   He shall haue nothing but the penalty.
2240   <S {Gra}.> O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge.
2241   <S {Por}.> Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,
2242   Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more
2243   But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more
2244   Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much
2245   As makes it light or heauy in the substance,
2246   Or the deuision of the twentieth part
2247   Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne
2248   But in the estimation of a hayre,
2249   Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
2250   <S {Gra}.> A second {Daniel}, a {Daniel} Iew,
2251   Now infidell I haue thee on the hip.
2252   <S {Por}.> Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture.
2253   <S {Shy}.> Giue me my principall, and let me goe.
2254   <S {Bass}.> I haue it ready for thee, heere it is.
2255   <S {Por}.> He hath refus'd it in the open Court,
2256   He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond.
2257   <S {Gra}.> A {Daniel} still say I, a second {Daniel},
2258   I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word.
2259   <S {Shy}.> Shall I not haue barely my principall?
2260   <S {Por}.> Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,
2261   To be taken so at thy perill Iew.
2262   <S {Shy}.> Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:
2263   Ile stay no longer question.
      <P Q1>
2264   <S {Por}.> Tarry Iew,
2265   The Law hath yet another hold on you.
2266   It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,
2267   If it be proued against an Alien,
2268   That by direct, or indirect attempts
2269   He seeke the life of any Citizen,
2270   The party gainst the which he doth contriue,
2271   Shall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe
2272   Comes to the priuie coffer of the State,
2273   And the offenders life lies in the mercy
2274   Of the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.
2275   In which predicament I say thou standst:
2276   For it appeares by manifest proceeding,
2277   That indirectly, and directly #to,
2278   Thou hast contriu'd against the very life
2279   Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd
2280   The danger formerly by me rehearst.
2281   Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
2282  *<S {Gra}.> Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,
2283   And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
2284   Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
2285   Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge.
2286  *<S {Duk}.> That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
2287   I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:
2288   For halfe thy wealth, it is {Anthonio's}
2289   The other halfe comes to the generall state,
2290   Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine.
2291   <S {Por}.> #I for the state, not for {Anthonio}.
2292   <S {Shy}.> Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,
2293   You take my house, when you do take the prop
2294   That doth sustaine my house: you take my life
2295   When you doe take the meanes whereby   I liue.
2296   <S {Por}.> What mercy can you render him {Anthonio}?
2297   <S {Gra}.> A halter {gratis}, nothing else for Gods sake.
2298  *<S {Ant}.> So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court
2299   To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,
2300   I am content: so he will let me haue
2301   The other halfe in vse, to render it
2302   Vpon his death, vnto the Gentleman
2303   That lately stole his daughter.
2304   Two things prouided more, that for this fauour
2305   He presently become a Christian:
2306   The other, that he doe record a gift
2307   Heere in the Court of all he dies possest
2308   Vnto his sonne {Lorenzo}, and his daughter.
2309   <S {Duk}.> He shall doe this, or else I doe recant
2310   The pardon that I late pronounced heere.
2311   <S {Por}.> Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?
2312   <S {Shy}.> I am content.
2313   <S {Por}.> Clarke, draw a deed of gift.
2314   <S {Shy}.> I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,
2315   I am not well, send the deed after me,
2316   And I will signe it.
2317   <S {Duke}.> Get thee gone, but doe it.
2318   <S {Gra}.> In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,
2319   Had I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,
2320   To bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.  <D {Exit}.>
2321   <S {Du}.> Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner.
2322   <S {Por}.> I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,
2323   I must away this night toward Padua,
2324   And it is meete I presently set forth.
2325   <S {Duk}.> I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:
2326   {#Anthonio}, gratifie this gentleman,
2327   For in my minde you are much bound to him.
2328   <D {Exit Duke and his traine}.>
2329   <S {Bass}.> Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
2330   Haue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted
2331   Of greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,
2332   Three thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew
2333   We freely cope your curteous paines withall.
2334   <S {An}.> And stand indebted ouer and aboue
2335   In loue and seruice to you euermore.
2336   <S {Por}.> He is well paid that is well satisfied,
2337   And I deliuering you, am satisfied,
2338   And therein doe account my selfe well paid,
2339   My minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.
2340   I pray you know me when we meete againe,
2341   I wish you well, and so I take my leaue.
2342   <S {Bass}.> Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,
2343   Take some remembrance of vs as a tribute,
2344   Not as fee: grant me two things, I pray you
2345   Not to denie me, and to pardon me.
2346  *<S {Por}.> You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,
2347   Giue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,
2348   And for your loue Ile take this ring from you,
2349   Doe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,
2350   And you in loue shall not deny me this?
2351   <S {Bass}.> This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,
2352   I will not shame my selfe to giue you this.
2353   <S {Por}.> I wil haue nothing else but onely this,
2354   And now methinkes I haue a minde to it.
2355  *<S {Bas}.> There's more depends on this then on the valew,
2356   The dearest ring in Venice will  I giue you,
2357   And finde it out by proclamation,
2358   Onely for this I pray you pardon me.
2359   <S {Por}.> I see sir you are liberall in offers,
2360   You taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes
2361   You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
2362   <S {Bas}.> Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,
2363   And when she put it on, she made me vow
2364   That I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it.
2365  *<S {Por}.> That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,
2366   And if your wife be not a mad woman,
2367   And know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,
2368   Shee would not hold out enemy for euer
2369   For giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2370   <S {Ant}.> My L[ord]. {Bassanio}, let him haue the ring,
2371   Let his deseruings and my loue withall
2372   Be valued against your wiues commandement.
2373   <S {Bass}.> Goe {Gratiano}, run and ouer- take him,
2374   Giue him the ring, and bring him if thou canst
2375   Vnto {Anthonios} house, away, make haste.  <D {Exit Grati}.>
2376   Come, you and I will thither presently,
2377   And in the morning early will we both
2378   Flie toward {Belmont}, come {Anthonio}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2379   <D {Enter Portia and Nerrissa}.>
2380  *<S {Por}.> Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,
2381   And let him signe it, wee'll away to night,
2382   And be a day before our husbands home:
2383   This deed will be well welcome to {Lorenzo}.
2384   <D {Enter Gratiano}.>
2385   <S {Gra}.> Faire sir, you are well ore- tane:
2386   My L[ord]. {Bassanio} vpon more aduice,
2387   Hath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat
2388   Your company at dinner.
2389   <S {Por}.> That cannot be;
2390   His ring I doe accept most thankfully,
2391   And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,
2392   I pray you shew my youth old {Shylockes} house.
2393   <S {Gra}.> That will I doe.
2394   <S {Ner}.> Sir, I would speake with you:
      <P Q1v>
2395   Ile see if I can get my husbands ring
2396   Which I did make him sweare to keepe for euer.
2397  *<S {Por}.> Thou maist I warrant, we shal haue old swearing
2398   That they did giue the rings away to men;
2399   But weele out- face them, and out- sweare them #to:
2400   Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry.
2401   <S {Ner}.> Come good sir, will you shew me to this house.
2402   <D {Exeunt}.>
2403   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2404   <D {Enter Lorenzo and Iessica}.>
2405  *<S {Lor}.> The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,
2406   When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,
2407   And they did make no noyse, in such a night
2408   {Troylus} me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,
2409   And sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents
2410   Where {Cressed} lay that night.
2411   <S {Ies}.> In such a night
2412   Did {Thisbie} fearefully ore- trip the dewe,
2413   And saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe,
2414   And ranne dismayed away.
2415   <S {Loren}.> In such a night
2416   Stood {Dido} with a Willow in her hand
2417   Vpon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Loue
2418   To come againe to Carthage.
2419   <S {Ies}.> In such a night
2420   {Medea} gathered the inchanted hearbs
2421   That did renew old {Eson}.
2422   <S {Loren}.> In such a night
2423   Did {Iessica} steale from the wealthy Iewe,
2424   And with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,
2425   As farre as Belmont.
2426   <S {Ies}.> In such a night
2427   Did young {Lorenzo} sweare he lou'd her well,
2428   Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith,
2429   And nere a true one.
2430   <S {Loren}.> In such a night
2431   Did pretty {Iessica} (like a little shrow)
2432   Slander her Loue, and he forgaue it her.
2433   <S {Iessi}.> I would out- night you did no body come:
2434   But harke, I heare the footing of a man.
2435   <D {Enter Messenger}.>
2436   <S {Lor}.> Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
2437   <S {Mes}.> A friend.
2438  *<S {Loren}.> A friend, what friend? your name I pray you |(friend?
2439   <S {Mes}.> {Stephano} is my name, and I bring word
2440   My Mistresse will before the breake of day
2441   Be heere at Belmont, she doth stray about
2442   By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes
2443   For happy wedlocke houres.
2444   <S {Loren}.> Who comes with her?
2445   <S {Mes}.> None but a holy Hermit and her maid:
2446   I pray you is my Master yet return'd?
2447   <S {Loren}.> He is not, nor we haue not heard from him,
2448   But goe we in I pray thee {Iessica},
2449   And ceremoniously let   vs prepare
2450   Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house,
2451   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
2452   <S {Clo}.> Sola, sola: wo ha ho, sola, sola.
2453   <S {Loren}.> Who calls?
2454  *<S {Clo}.> Sola, did you see M[aster]. {Lorenzo}, & M[aster]. {Lorenzo}, sola,
2455   <S {Lor}.> Leaue hollowing man, heere.
2456   <S {Clo}.> Sola, where, where?
2457   <S {Lor}.> Heere?
2458  *<S {Clo}.> Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with
2459  *his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere
2460   morning sweete soule.
2461   <S {Loren}.> Let's in, and there expect their comming.
2462   And yet no matter: why should we goe in?
2463   My friend {Stephen}, signifie pray you
2464   Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,
2465   And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.
2466   How sweet the moone- light sleepes vpon this banke,
2467   Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke
2468   Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night
2469   Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:
2470   Sit {Iessica}, looke how the floore of heauen
2471   Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,
2472   There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst
2473   But in his motion like an Angell sings,
2474   Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;
2475   Such harmonie is in immortall soules,
2476   But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
2477   Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:
2478   Come hoe, and wake {Diana} with a hymne,
2479   With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,
2480   And draw her home with musicke.
2481  *<S {Iessi}.> I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.
2482   <D {Play musicke}.>
2483   <S {Lor}.> The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:
2484   For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard
2485   Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,
2486   Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
2487   Which is the hot condition of their bloud,
2488   If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,
2489   Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,
2490   You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,
2491   Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,
2492   By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet
2493   Did faine that {Orpheus} drew trees, stones, and floods.
2494   Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
2495   But musicke for time doth change his nature,
2496   The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,
2497   Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,
2498   Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,
2499   The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
2500   And his affections darke as {Erobus},
2501   Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.
2502   <D {Enter Portia and Nerrissa}.>
2503   <S {Por}.> That light we see is burning in my hall:
2504   How farre that little candell throwes his beames,
2505   So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
2506  *<S {Ner}.> When the moone shone we did not see the can-|(dle?
2507   <S {Por}.> So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,
2508   A substitute shines brightly as a King
2509   Vntill a King be by, and then his state
2510   Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke
2511   Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.  <D {Musicke}.>
2512   <S {Ner}.> It is your musicke Madame of the house.
2513   <S {Por}.> Nothing is good I see without respect,
2514   Methinkes   it sounds much sweeter then by day?
2515   <S {Ner}.> Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam.
2516   <S {Por}.> The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke
      <P Q2><C B>
2517   When neither is attended: and I thinke
2518   The Nightingale if she should sing by day
2519   When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought
2520   No better a Musitian then the Wren?
2521   How many things by season, season'd are
2522   To their right praise, and true perfection:
2523   Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,
2524   And would not be awak'd.
2525   <D {Musicke ceases}.>
2526   <S {Lor}.> That is the voice,
2527   Or I am much deceiu'd of {Portia}.
2528   <S {Por}.> He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the
2529   Cuckow by the bad voice?
2530   <S {Lor}.> Deere Lady welcome home?
2531  *<S {Por}.> We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare
2532   Which speed we hope the better for our words,
2533   Are they return'd?
2534   <S {Lor}.> Madam, they are not yet:
2535   But there is come a Messenger before
2536   To signifie their comming.
2537   <S {Por}.> Go in {Nerrissa},
2538   Giue order to my seruants, that they take
2539   No note at all of our being absent hence,
2540   Nor you {Lorenzo}, {Iessica} nor you.
2541   <D {A Tucket sounds}.>
2542   <S {Lor}.> Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,
2543   We are no tell- tales Madam, feare you not.
2544   <S {Por}.> This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,
2545   It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,
2546   Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.
2547   <D {Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their}
2548   {Followers}.>
2549   <S {Bas}.> We should hold day with the Antipodes,
2550   If you would walke in absence of the sunne.
2551   <S {Por}.> Let me giue light, but let me not be light,
2552   For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,
2553   And neuer be {Bassanio} so for me,
2554   But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord.
2555  *<S {Bass}.> I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend
2556   This is the man, this is {Anthonio},
2557   To whom I am so infinitely bound.
2558  *<S {Por}.> You should in all sence be much bound to him,
2559   For as I heare he was much bound for you.
2560   <S {Anth}.> No more then I am wel acquitted of.
2561   <S {Por}.> Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:
2562   It must appeare in other waies then words,
2563   Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie.
2564   <S {Gra}.> By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,
2565   Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,
2566   Would he were gelt that had it for my part,
2567   Since you do take it Loue so much at hart.
2568   <S {Por}.> A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?
2569   <S {Gra}.> About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring
2570   That she did giue me, whose Poesie was
2571   For all the world like Cutlers Poetry
2572   Vpon a knife; {Loue mee, and leaue mee not}.
2573   <S {Ner}.> What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:
2574   You swore to me when I did giue it you,
2575   That you would weare it til the houre of death,
2576   And that it should lye with you in your graue,
2577   Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
2578   You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.
2579   Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know
2580   The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it.
2581   <S {Gra}.> He wil, #and if he liue to be a man.
2582   <S {Nerrissa}.> #I, if a Woman liue to be a man.
2583   <S {Gra}.> Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,
2584   A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
2585   No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,
2586   A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,
2587   I could not for my heart deny it him.
2588   <S {Por}.> You were #too blame, I must be plaine with you,
2589   To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,
2590   A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,
2591   And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.
2592   I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare
2593   Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:
2594   I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,
2595   Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth
2596   That the world masters. Now in faith {Gratiano},
2597   You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,
2598   #And 'twere to me I should be mad at it.
2599   <S {Bass}.> Why I were best to cut my left hand off,
2600   And sweare I lost the Ring defending it.
2601   <S {Gra}.> My Lord {Bassanio} gaue his Ring away
2602   Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede
2603   Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke
2604   That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,
2605   And neyther man nor master would take ought
2606   But the two Rings.
2607   <S {Por}.> What Ring gaue you my Lord?
2608   Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me.
2609   <S {Bass}.> If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,
2610   I would deny it: but you see my finger
2611   Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone.
2612   <S {Por}.> Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.
2613   By heauen I wil nere come in your bed
2614   Vntil I see the Ring.
2615   <S {Ner}.> Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine.
2616   <S {Bass}.> Sweet {Portia},
2617   If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,
2618   If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,
2619   And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,
2620   And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,
2621   When nought would be accepted but the Ring,
2622   You would abate the strength of your displeasure?
2623   <S {Por}.> If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,
2624   Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,
2625   Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,
2626   You would not then haue parted with the Ring:
2627   What man is there so much vnreasonable,
2628   If you had pleas'd to haue defended it
2629   With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie
2630   To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:
2631   {#Nerrissa} teaches me what to beleeue,
2632   Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?
2633   <S {Bass}.> No by mine honor Madam, by my soule
2634   No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,
2635   Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,
2636   And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,
2637   And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:
2638   Euen he that had held vp the verie life
2639   Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?
2640   I was inforc'd to send it after him,
2641   I was beset with shame and curtesie,
2642   My honor would not let ingratitude
2643   So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,
2644   And by these blessed Candles of the night,
2645   Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd
2646   The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?
      <P Q2v><C C>
2647   <S {Por}.> Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,
2648   Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,
2649   And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,
2650   I will become as liberall as you,
2651   Ile not deny him any thing I haue,
2652   No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:
2653   Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
2654   Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,
2655   If you doe not, if I be left alone,
2656   Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,
2657   Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow.
2658  *<S {Nerrissa}.> And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd
2659   How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection.
2660   <S {Gra}.> Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,
2661   For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen.
2662   <S {Ant}.> I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels.
2663   <S {Por}.> Sir, grieue not you,
2664   You are welcome notwithstanding.
2665   <S {Bas}.> {Portia}, forgiue me this enforced wrong,
2666   And in the hearing of these manie friends
2667   I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes
2668   Wherein I see my selfe.
2669   <S {Por}.> Marke you but that?
2670   In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:
2671   In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,
2672   And there's an oath of credit.
2673   <S {Bas}.> Nay, but heare me.
2674   Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare
2675   I neuer more will breake an oath with thee.
2676   <S {Anth}.> I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,
2677   Which but for him that had your husbands ring
2678   Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,
2679   My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord
2680   Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie.
2681   <S {Por}.> Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,
2682   And bid him keepe it better then the other.
2683   <S {Ant}.> Heere Lord {Bassanio}, swear to keep this ring.
2684   <S {Bass}.> By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor.
2685   <S {Por}.> I had it of him: pardon {Bassanio},
2686   For by this ring the Doctor lay with me.
2687   <S {Ner}.> And pardon me my gentle {Gratiano},
2688   For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke
2689   In liew of this, last night did lye with me.
2690   <S {Gra}.> Why this is like the mending of high waies
2691   In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:
2692   What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it.
2693   <S {Por}.> Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;
2694   Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,
2695   It comes from Padua from {Bellario},
2696   There you shall finde that {Portia} was the Doctor,
2697   {#Nerrissa} there her Clarke. {Lorenzo} heere
2698   Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,
2699   And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet
2700   Entred my house. {Anthonio} you are welcome,
2701   And I haue better newes in store for you
2702   Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,
2703   There you shall finde three of your Argosies
2704   Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.
2705   You shall not know by what strange accident
2706   I chanced on this letter.
2707   <S {Antho}.> I am dumbe.
2708   <S {Bass}.> Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?
2709  *<S {Gra}.> Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold.
2710   <S {Ner}.> #I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,
2711   Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man.
2712   <S {Bass}.> (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,
2713   When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
2714  *<S {An}.> (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life & liuing;
2715   For heere I reade for certaine that my ships
2716   Are safelie come to Rode.
2717   <S {Por}.> How now {Lorenzo}?
2718   My Clarke hath some good comforts #to for you.
2719   <S {Ner}.> #I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.
2720   There doe I giue to you and {Iessica}
2721   From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift
2722   After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
2723   <S {Loren}.> Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way
2724   Of starued people.
2725   <S {Por}.> It is almost morning,
2726   And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
2727   Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,
2728   And charge vs there vpon intergatories,
2729   And we will answer all things faithfully.
2730   <S {Gra}.> Let it be so, the first intergatory
2731   That my {Nerrissa} shall be sworne on, is,
2732   Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
2733   Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,
2734   But were the day come, I should wish it darke,
2735   Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.
2736   Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing
2737   So sore, as keeping safe {Nerrissas} ring.
2738   <D {Exeunt}.>
