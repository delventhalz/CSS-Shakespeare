33     <Z {Actus Primus. Scoena Prima}.>
34     <D {Enter Pandarus and Troylus}.>
35     <S {Troylus}.>
36     Call here my Varlet, Ile vnarme againe.
37    *Why should I warre without the wals of Troy
38     That finde such cruell battell here within?
39     Each Troian that is master of his heart,
40     Let him to field, {Troylus} alas hath none.
41     <S {Pan}.> Will this geere nere be mended?
42    *<S {Troy}.> The Greeks are strong, & skilful to their strength,
43     Fierce to their skill, and to their fiercenesse Valiant:
44     But I am weaker then a womans teare;
45     Tamer then sleepe, fonder then ignorance;
46     Lesse valiant then the Virgin in the night,
47     And skillesse as vnpractis'd Infancie.
48    *<S {Pan}.> Well, I haue told you enough of this: For my
49    *part, Ile not meddle nor make no farther. Hee that will
50    *haue a Cake out of the Wheate, must needes tarry the
51     grinding.
52     <S {Troy}.> Haue I not tarried?
53     <S {Pan}.> #I the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
54     <S {Troy}.> Haue I not tarried?
55    *<S {Pan}.> #I the boulting; but you must tarry the leau'ning,
56     <S {Troy}.> Still haue I tarried.
57    *<S {Pan}.> #I, to the leauening: but heeres yet in the word
58    *hereafter, the Kneading, the making of the Cake, the
59    *heating of the Ouen, and the Baking; nay, you must stay
60     the cooling too, or you may chance to burne your lips.
61     <S {Troy}.> Patience her selfe, what Goddesse ere she be,
62     Doth lesser blench at sufferance, then I doe:
63     At {Priams} Royall Table doe I sit;
64     And when faire {Cressid} comes into my thoughts,
65     So (Traitor) then she comes, when she is thence.
66     <S {Pan}.> Well:
67     She look'd yesternight fairer, then euer I saw her looke,
68     Or any woman else.
69     <S {Troy}.> I was about to tell thee, when my heart,
70     As wedged with a sigh, would riue in twaine,
71     Least {Hector}, or my Father should perceiue me:
72     I haue (as when the Sunne doth light a- scorne)
73     Buried this sigh, in wrinkle of a smile:
74     But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladnesse,
75     Is like that mirth, Fate turnes to sudden sadnesse.
76    *<S {Pan}.> #And her haire were not somewhat darker then
77    *{Helens}, well go #too, there were no more comparison be-tweene
78    *the Women. But for my part she is my Kinswo-man,
79    *I would not (as they tearme it) praise it, but I wold
80    *some- body had heard her talke yesterday as I did: I will
81     not dispraise your sister {Cassandra's} wit, but===
82     <S {Troy}.> Oh {Pandarus}! I tell thee {Pandarus};
83     When I doe tell thee, there my hopes lye drown'd:
84     Reply not in how many Fadomes deepe
85     They lye indrench'd. I tell thee, I am mad
86     In {Cressids} loue. Thou answer'st she is Faire,
87     Powr'st in the open Vlcer of my heart,
88     Her Eyes, her Haire, her Cheeke, her Gate, her Voice,
89     Handlest in thy discourse. O that her Hand
90     (In whose comparison, all whites are Inke)
91     Writing their owne reproach; to whose soft seizure,
92     The Cignets Downe is harsh, and spirit of Sense
93     Hard as the palme of Plough- man. This thou tel'st me;
94     As true thou tel'st me, when I say I loue her:
95     But saying thus, instead of Oyle and Balme,
96     Thou lai'st in euery gash that loue hath giuen me,
97     The Knife that made it.
98     <S {Pan}.> I speake no more then truth.
99     <S {Troy}.> Thou do'st not speake so much.
100   *<S {Pan}.> Faith, Ile not meddle in't: Let her be as shee is,
101   *if she be faire, 'tis the better for her: #and she be not, she
102    ha's the mends in her owne hands.
103    <S {Troy}.> Good {Pandarus}: How now {Pandarus}?
104   *<S {Pan}.> I haue had my Labour for my trauell, #ill thought
105   *on of her, and #ill thought on of you: Gone betweene and
106    betweene, but small thankes for my labour.
107   *<S {Troy}.> What art thou angry {Pandarus}? what with me?
108   *<S {Pan}.> Because she's Kinne to me, therefore shee's not
109   *so faire as {Helen}, #and she were not kin to me, she would
110   *be as faire on Friday, as {Helen} is on Sunday. But what
111   *care I? I care not #and she were a Black- a- Moore, 'tis all
112    one to me.
113    <S {Troy}.> Say I she is not faire?
114   *<S {Troy}.> I doe not care whether you doe or no, Shee's a
115   *Foole to stay behinde her Father: Let her to the Greeks,
116   *and so Ile tell her the next time I see her: for my part, Ile
117    meddle nor make no more i'th' matter.
118    <S {Troy}.> {Pandarus}? <S {Pan}.> Not I.
119    <S {Troy}.> Sweete {Pandarus}.
120   *<S {Pan}.> Pray you speake no more to me, I will  leaue all
121    as I found it, and there an end.  <D {Exit Pand}.>
122    <D {Sound Alarum}.>
123   *<S {Tro}.> Peace you vngracious Clamors, peace rude sounds,
124    Fooles on both sides, {Helen} must needs be faire,
125    When with your bloud you daily paint her thus.
126    I cannot fight vpon this Argument:
      <P XX2><C E>
127    It is too staru'd a subiect for my Sword,
128    But {Pandarus}: O Gods! How do you plague me?
129    I cannot come to {Cressid} but by {Pandar},
130    And he's as teachy to be woo'd to woe,
131    As she is stubborne, chast, against all suite.
132    Tell me {Apollo} for thy {Daphnes} Loue
133    What {Cressid} is, what {Pandar}, and what we:
134    Her bed is {India}, there she lies, a Pearle,
135    Between our Ilium, and where shee recides
136    Let it be cald the wild and wandring flood,
137    Our selfe the Merchant, and this sayling {Pandar},
138    Our doubtfull hope, our conuoy and our Barke.
139    <D {Alarum. Enter Aeneas}.>
140    <S {Aene}.> How now Prince {Troylus}?
141    Wherefore not #a field?
142   *<S {Troy}.> Because not there; this womans answer sorts.
143    For womanish it is to be from thence:
144    What newes {Aeneas} from the field to day?
145    <S {Aene}.> That {Paris} is returned home, and hurt.
146    <S {Troy}.> By whom {Aeneas}?
147    <S {Aene}.> {Troylus} by {Menelaus}.
148    <S {Troy}.> Let {Paris} bleed, 'tis but a scar to scorne.
149    {#Paris} is gor'd with {Menelaus} horne.  <D {Alarum}.>
150   *<S {Aene}.> Harke what good sport is out of Towne to day.
151    <S {Troy}.> Better at home, if #would I might were #may:
152    But to the sport abroad, are you bound thither?
153    <S {Aene}.> In all swift #hast.
154    <S {Troy}.> Come goe wee then togither.  <D {Exeunt}.>
155    <D {Enter Cressid and her man}.>
156    <S {Cre}.> Who were those went by?
157    <S {Man}.> Queene {Hecuba}, and {Hellen}.
158    <S {Cre}.> And whether go they?
159    <S {Man}.> Vp to the Easterne Tower,
160    Whose height commands as subiect all the vaile,
161    To see the battell: {Hector} whose pacience,
162    Is as a Vertue fixt, to day was mou'd:
163    He chides {Andromache} and strooke his Armorer,
164    And like as there were husbandry in Warre
165    Before the Sunne rose, hee was harnest lyte,
166    And to the field goe's he; where euery flower
167    Did as a Prophet weepe what it forsaw,
168    In {Hectors} wrath.
169    <S {Cre}.> What was his cause of anger?
170    <S {Man}.> The noise goe's thus;
171    There is among the Greekes,
172    A Lord of Troian blood, Nephew to {Hector},
173    They call him {Aiax}.
174    <S {Cre}.> Good; and what of him?
175   *<S {Man}.> They say he is a very man {per se} and stands alone.
176   *<S {Cre}.> So do all men, vnlesse they are drunke, sicke, or
177    haue no legges.
178   *<S {Man}.> This man Lady, hath rob'd many beasts of their
179   *particular additions, he is as valiant as the Lyon, churlish
180   *as the  Beare, slow as the Elephant: a man into whom
181   *nature hath so crowded humors, that his valour is crusht
182   *into folly, his folly sauced with discretion: there is no
183   *man hath a vertue, that he hath not a glimpse of, nor a-ny
184   *man an attaint, but he carries some staine of it. He is
185   *melancholy without cause, and merry against the haire,
186   *hee hath the ioynts of euery thing, but euery thing so
187   *out of ioynt, that hee is a gowtie {Briareus}, many hands
188    and no vse; or purblinded {Argus}, all eyes and no sight.
189   *<S {Cre}.> But how should this man that makes me smile,
190    make {Hector} angry?
191   *<S {Man}.> They say he yesterday cop'd {Hector} in the bat-tell
192   *and stroke him downe, the disdaine & shame where-of,
193    hath euer since kept {Hector} fasting and waking.
194    <D {Enter Pandarus}.>
195    <S {Cre}.> Who comes here?
196    <S {Man}.> Madam your Vncle {Pandarus}.
197    <S {Cre}.> {Hector}s a gallant man.
198    <S {Man}.> As may be in the world Lady.
199    <S {Pan}.> What's that? what's that?
200    <S {Cre}.> Good morrow Vncle {Pandarus}.
201   *<S {Pan}.> Good morrow Cozen {Cressid}: what do you talke
202   *of? good morrow {Alexander}: how do you Cozen? when
203    were you at Illium?
204    <S {Cre}.> This morning Vncle.
205   *<S {Pan}.> What were you talking of when I came? Was
206   *{#Hector} arm'd and gon ere yea came to Illium? {Hellen} was
207    not vp? was she?
208    <S {Cre}.> {Hector} was gone but {Hellen} was not vp?
209    <S {Pan}.> E'ene so; {Hector} was stirring early.
210    <S {Cre}.> That were we talking of, and of his anger.
211    <S {Pan}.> Was he angry?
212    <S {Cre}.> So he saies here.
213   *<S {Pan}.> True he was so; I know the cause too, heele lay
214   *about him to day I can tell them that, and there's {Troylus}
215   *will not come farre behind him, let them take heede of
216    {#Troylus}; I can tell them that too.
217    <S {Cre}.> What is he angry too?
218    <S {Pan}.> Who {Troylus}?
219    {#Troylus} is the better man of the two.
220    <S {Cre}.> Oh {Iupiter}; there's no comparison.
221   *<S {Pan}.> What not betweene {Troylus} and {Hector}? do you
222    know a man if you see him?
223    <S {Cre}.> #I, if I euer saw him before and knew him.
224    <S {Pan}.> Well I say {Troylus} is {Troylus}.
225    <S {Cre}.> Then you say as I say,
226    For I am sure he is not {Hector}.
227    <S {Pan}.> No not {Hector} is not {Troylus} in some degrees.
228    <S {Cre}.> 'Tis iust, to each of them he is himselfe.
229    <S {Pan}.> Himselfe? alas poore {Troylus} I would he were.
230    <S {Cre}.> So he is.
231    <S {Pan}.> Condition I had gone bare- foote to India.
232    <S {Cre}.> He is not {Hector}.
233   *<S {Pan}.> Himselfe? no? hee's not himselfe, would #a were
234   *himselfe: well, the Gods are aboue, time must friend or
235   *end: well {Troylus} well, I would my heart were in her bo-dy;
236    no, {Hector} is not a better man then {Troylus}.
237    <S {Cre}.> Excuse me.
238    <S {Pan}.> He is elder.
239    <S {Cre}.> Pardon me, pardon me.
240   *<S {Pan}.> Th' others not come too't, you shall tell me ano-ther
241   *tale when th' others come too't: {Hector} shall not
242    haue his #will this yeare.
243    <S {Cre}.> He shall not neede it if he haue his owne.
244    <S {Pan}.> Nor his qualities.
245    <S {Cre}.> No matter.
246    <S {Pan}.> Nor his beautie.
247    <S {Cre}.> 'Twould not become him, his own's better.
248   *<S {Pan}.> You haue no iudgement Neece; {Hellen} her selfe
249   *swore th' other day, that {Troylus} for a browne fauour (for
250    so 'tis I must confesse) not browne neither.
251    <S {Cre}.> No, but browne.
252    <S {Pan}.> Faith to say truth, browne and not browne.
253    <S {Cre}.> To say the truth, true and not true.
254    <S {Pan}.> She prais'd his complexion aboue {Paris}.
255    <S {Cre}.> Why {Paris} hath colour inough.
256    <S {Pan}.> So he has.
257   *<S {Cre}.> Then {Troylus} should haue too much, if she prais'd
258   *him aboue, his complexion is higher then his, he hauing
      <P XX2v>
259   *colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a
260   *praise for a good complexion, I had as lieue {Hellens} gol-den
261    tongue had commended {Troylus} for a copper nose.
262    <S {Pan}.> I sweare to you,
263    I thinke {Hellen} loues him better then {Paris}.
264    <S {Cre}.> Then shee's a merry Greeke indeed.
265   *<S {Pan}.> Nay I am sure she does, she came to him th' other
266   *day into the compast window, and  you know he has not
267    past three or foure haires on his chinne.
268   *<S {Cres}.> Indeed a Tapsters Arithmetique may soone
269    bring his particulars as therein, to a totall.
270   *<S {Pand}.> Why he is very yong, and yet will he within
271    three pound lift as much as his brother {Hector}.
272    <S {Cres}.> Is he is so young a man, and so old a lifter?
273   *<S {Pan}.> But to prooue to you that {Hellen} loues him, she
274    came and puts me her white hand to his clouen chin.
275    <S {Cres}.> {Iuno} haue mercy, how came it clouen?
276    <S {Pan}.> Why, you know 'tis dimpled,
277   *I thinke his smyling becomes him better then any man
278    in all Phrigia.
279    <S {Cre}.> Oh he smiles valiantly.
280    <S {Pan}.> Dooes hee not?
281    <S {Cre}.> Oh yes, #and  'twere a clow'd in {Autumne}.
282   *<S {Pan}.> Why go to then, but to proue to you that {Hellen}
283    loues {Troylus}.
284    <S {Cre}.> {Troylus} wil stand to thee
285    Proofe, if youle prooue it so.
286   *<S {Pan}.> {Troylus}? why he esteemes her no more then I e-steeme
287    an addle egge.
288   *<S {Cre}.> If you loue an addle egge as well as you loue an
289    idle head, you would eate chickens i'th' shell.
290   *<S {Pan}.> I cannot chuse but laugh to thinke how she tick-led
291   *his chin, indeed shee has a maruel's white hand I must
292    needs confesse.
293    <S {Cre}.> Without the racke.
294   *<S {Pan}.> And shee takes vpon her to spie a white haire on
295    his chinne.
296    <S {Cre}.> Alas poore chin? many a wart is richer.
297   *<S {Pand}.> But there was such laughing, Queene {Hecuba}
298    laught that her eyes ran ore.
299    <S {Cre}.> With Milstones.
300    <S {Pan}.> And {Cassandra} laught.
301   *<S {Cre}.> But there was more temperate fire vnder the pot
302    of her eyes: did her eyes run ore too?
303    <S {Pan}.> And {Hector} laught.
304    <S {Cre}.> At what was all this laughing?
305   *<S {Pand}.> Marry at the white haire that {Hellen} spied on
306    {#Troylus} chin.
307   *<S {Cres}.> #And t'had beene a greene haire, I should haue
308    laught too.
309   *<S {Pand}.> They laught not so much at the haire, as at his
310    pretty answere.
311    <S {Cre}.> What was his answere?
312   *<S {Pan}.> Quoth shee, heere's but two and fifty haires on
313    your chinne; and one of them is white.
314    <S {Cre}.> This is her question.
315   *<S {Pand}.> That's true, make no question of that, two and
316   *fiftie haires quoth hee, and one white, that white haire is
317   *my Father, and all the rest are his Sonnes. {Iupiter} quoth
318   *she, which of these haires is {Paris} my husband? The for-ked
319   *one quoth he, pluckt out and giue it him: but there
320   *was such laughing, and {Hellen} so blusht, and {Paris} so
321    chaft, and all the rest so laught, that it past.
322    <S {Cre}.> So let it now,
323    For it has beene a great while going by.
324    <S {Pan}.> Well Cozen,
325    I told you a thing yesterday, think on't.
326    <S {Cre}.> So I does.
327   *<S {Pand}.> Ile be sworne 'tis true, he will weepe you
328    #an 'twere a man borne in Aprill.  <D {Sound a retreate}.>
329   *<S {Cres}.> And Ile spring vp in his teares, #an 'twere a nettle
330    against #May.
331   *<S {Pan}.> Harke they are comming from the field, shal we
332   *stand vp here and see them, as they passe toward Illium,
333    good Neece do, sweet Neece {Cressida}.
334    <S {Cre}.> At your pleasure.
335   *<S {Pan}.> Heere, heere, here's an excellent place, heere we
336   *may see most brauely, Ile tel you them all by their names,
337    as they passe by, but marke {Troylus} aboue the rest.
338    <D {Enter Aeneas}.>
339    <S {Cre}.> Speake not so low'd.
340   *<S {Pan}.> That's {Aeneas}, is not that a braue man, hee's one
341   *of the flowers of Troy I #can you, marke {Troylus}, you
342    shal see anon.
343    <S {Cre}.> Who's that?
344    <D {Enter Antenor}.>
345   *<S {Pan}.> That's {Antenor}, he has a shrow'd wit I can tell
346   *you, and hee's a man good inough, hee's one o'th soun-dest
347   *iudgement in Troy whosoeuer, and a proper man of
348   *person: when comes {Troylus}? Ile shew you {Troylus} anon,
349    if hee see me, you shall see him nod at me.
350    <S {Cre}.> Will he giue you the nod?
351    <S {Pan}.> You shall see.
352    <S {Cre}.> If he do, the rich shall haue, more.
353    <D {Enter Hector}.>
354   *<S {Pan}.> That's {Hector}, that, that looke you, that there's a
355   *fellow. Goe thy way {Hector}, there's a braue man Neece,
356   *O braue {Hector}! Looke how hee lookes? there's a coun-tenance;
357    ist not a braue man?
358    <S {Cre}.> O braue man!
359   *<S {Pan}.> Is #a not? It dooes a mans heart good, looke you
360   *what hacks are on his Helmet, looke you yonder, do you
361   *see? Looke you there? There's no iesting, laying on, tak't
362    off, who will as they say, there be hacks.
363    <S {Cre}.> Be those with Swords?
364    <D {Enter Paris}.>
365   *<S {Pan}.> Swords, any thing he cares not, #and the diuell
366   *come to him, it's all one, by Gods lid it dooes ones heart
367   *good. Yonder comes {Paris}, yonder comes {Paris}: looke
368   *yee yonder Neece, ist not a gallant man #to, ist not? Why
369   *this is braue now: who said he came hurt home to day?
370   *Hee's not hurt, why this will do {Hellens} heart good
371   *now, ha? Would I could see {Troylus} now, you shall {Troy-lus}
372    anon.
373    <S {Cre}.> Whose that?
374    <D {Enter Hellenus}.>
375   *<S {Pan}.> That's {Hellenus}, I maruell where {Troylus} is, that's
376   *{Helenus}, I thinke he went not forth to day: that's {Hel-lenus}.
377   _
378    <S {Cre}.> Can {Hellenus} fight Vncle?
379   *<S {Pan}.> {Hellenus} no: yes heele fight indifferent, well, I
380   *maruell where {Troylus} is; harke, do you not heare the
381    people crie {Troylus}? {Hellenus} is a Priest.
382    <S {Cre}.> What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
383    <D {Enter Troylus}.>
384   *<S {Pan}.> Where? Yonder? That's {Doephobus}. 'Tis {Troy-lus}!
385   *Ther's a man Neece, hem? Braue {Troylus} the Prince
386    of Chiualrie.
387    <S {Cre}.> Peace, for shame peace.
388   *<S {Pand}.> Marke him, #not him: O braue {Troylus}: looke
389   *well vpon him Neece, looke you how his Sword is blou-died,
390   *and his Helme more hackt then {Hectors}, and how he
      <P YY1><C B>
391   *lookes, and how he goes. O admirable youth! he ne're
392   *saw three and twenty. Go thy way {Troylus}, go thy way,
393   *had I a sister were a {Grace}, or a daughter a Goddesse, hee
394   *should take his choice. O admirable man! {Paris}? {Paris}
395   *is durt to him, and I warrant, {Helen} to change, would
396    giue money to boot.
397    <D {Enter common Souldiers}.>
398    <S {Cres}.> Heere come more.
399   *<S {Pan}.> Asses, fooles, dolts, chaffe and bran, chaffe and
400   *bran; porredge after meat. I could liue and dye i'th' eyes
401   *of {Troylus}. Ne're looke, ne're looke; the Eagles are gon,
402   *Crowes and Dawes, Crowes and Dawes: I had rather be
403    such a man as {Troylus}, then {Agamemnon}, and all Greece.
404   *<S {Cres}.> There is among the Greekes {Achilles}, a better
405    man then {Troylus}.
406    <S {Pan}.> {Achilles}? a Dray- man, a Porter, a very Camell.
407    <S {Cres}.> Well, well.
408   *<S {Pan}.> Well, well? Why haue you any discretion? haue
409   *you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth,
410   *beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gen-tlenesse,
411   *vertue, youth, liberality, and so forth: the Spice,
412    and salt that seasons a man?
413   *<S {Cres}.> #I, a minc'd man, and then to be bak'd with no Date
414    in the pye, for then the mans dates out.
415   *<S {Pan}.> You are such another woman, one knowes not
416    at what ward you lye.
417   *<S {Cres}.> Vpon my backe, to defend my belly; vpon my
418   *wit, to defend my wiles; vppon my secrecy, to defend
419   *mine honesty; my Maske, to defend my beauty, and you
420   *to defend all these: and all these wardes I lye at, at a
421    thousand watches.
422    <S {Pan}.> Say one of your watches.
423   *<S {Cres}.> Nay Ile watch you for that, and that's one of
424   *the cheefest of them too: If I cannot ward what I would
425   *not haue hit, I can watch you for telling how I took the
426   *blow, vnlesse it swell past hiding, and then it's past wat-ching.
427   _
428    <D {Enter Boy}.>
429    <S {Pan}.> You are such another.
430    <S {Boy}.> Sir, my Lord would instantly speake with you.
431    <S {Pan}.> Where?
432    <S {Boy}.> At your owne house.
433   *<S {Pan}.> Good Boy tell him I come, I doubt he bee hurt.
434    Fare ye well good Neece.
435    <S {Cres}.> Adieu Vnkle.
436    <S {Pan}.> Ile be with you Neece #by and by.
437    <S {Cres}.> To bring Vnkle.
438    <S {Pan}.> #I, a token from {Troylus}.
439    <S {Cres}.> By the same token, you are a Bawd.  <D {Exit Pand}.>
440    Words, vowes, gifts, teares, & loues full sacrifice,
441    He offers in anothers enterprise:
442    But more in {Troylus} thousand fold I see,
443    Then in the glasse of {Pandar's} praise may be;
444    Yet hold I off. Women are Angels wooing,
445    Things won are done, ioyes soule lyes in the dooing:
446   *That #she belou'd, knowes nought, that knowes not this;
447    Men prize the thing vngain'd, more then it is.
448    That #she was neuer yet, that euer knew
449    Loue got so sweet, as when desire did sue:
450    Therefore this maxime out of loue I teach;
451    "{Atchieuement, is command; vngain'd, beseech}.
452    That though my hearts Contents firme loue doth beare,
453    Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appeare.  <D {Exit}.>
454    <D {Senet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Vlysses, Diome-des},
455    {Menelaus, with others}.>
456    <S {Agam}.> Princes:
457    What greefe hath set the Iaundies on your cheekes?
458    The ample proposition that hope makes
459    In all designes, begun on earth below
460    Fayles in the promist largenesse: checkes and disasters
461    Grow in the veines of actions highest rear'd.
462    As knots by the conflux of meeting sap,
463    Infect the sound Pine, and diuerts his Graine
464    Tortiue and erant from his course of growth.
465    Nor Princes, is it matter new to vs,
466    That we come short of our suppose so farre,
467    That after seuen yeares siege, yet Troy walles stand,
468    Sith euery action that hath gone before,
469    Whereof we haue Record, Triall did draw
470    Bias and thwart, not answering the ayme:
471    And that vnbodied figure of the thought
472    That gaue't surmised shape. Why then (you Princes)
473    Do you with cheekes abash'd, behold our workes,
474   *And thinke them shame, which are (indeed) nought else
475    But the protractiue trials of great Ioue,
476    To finde persistiue constancie in men?
477    The finenesse of which Mettall is not found
478    In Fortunes loue: for then, the Bold and Coward,
479    The Wise and Foole, the Artist and vn- read,
480    The hard and soft, seeme all affin'd, and kin.
481    But on the Winde and Tempest of her frowne,
482    Distinction with a lowd and powrefull fan,
483    Puffing at all, winnowes the light away;
484    And what hath masse, or matter by it selfe,
485    Lies rich in Vertue, and vnmingled.
486    <S {Nestor}.> With due Obseruance of thy godly seat,
487    Great {Agamemnon}, {Nestor} shall apply
488    Thy latest words.
489    In the reproofe of Chance,
490    Lies the true proofe of men: The Sea being smooth,
491    How many shallow bauble Boates dare saile
492    Vpon her patient brest, making their way
493    With those of Nobler bulke?
494    But let the Ruffian {Boreas} once enrage
495    The gentle {Thetis}, and anon behold
496   *The strong ribb'd Barke through liquid Mountaines cut,
497    Bounding betweene the two moyst Elements
498    Like {Perseus} Horse. Where's then the sawcy Boate,
499    Whose weake vntimber'd sides but euen now
500    Co- riual'd Greatnesse? Either to harbour fled,
501    Or made a Toste for Neptune. Euen so,
502    Doth valours shew, and valours worth diuide
503    In stormes of Fortune.
504    For, in her ray and brightnesse,
505    The Heard hath more annoyance by the Brieze
506    Then by the Tyger: But, when the splitting winde
507    Makes flexible the knees of knotted Oakes,
508    And Flies fled vnder shade, why then
509    The thing of Courage,
510    As rowz'd with rage, with rage doth sympathize,
511    And with an accent tun'd in selfe- same key,
512    Retyres to chiding Fortune.
513    <S {Vlys}.> {Agamemnon}:
514    Thou great Commander, Nerue, and Bone of Greece,
515    Heart of our Numbers, soule, and onely spirit,
516    In whom the tempers, and the mindes of all
517    Should be shut vp: Heare what {Vlysses} speakes,
518    Besides the applause and approbation
519    The which most mighty for thy place and sway,
      <P YY1v>
520    And thou most reuerend for thy stretcht- out life,
521    I giue to both your speeches: which were such,
522    As {Agamemnon} and the hand of Greece
523    Should hold vp high in Brasse: and such againe
524    As venerable {Nestor} (hatch'd in Siluer)
525    Should with a bond of ayre, strong as the Axletree
526    In which the Heauens ride, knit all Greekes eares
527    To his experienc'd tongue: yet let it please both
528    (Thou Great, and Wise) to heare {Vlysses} speake.
529   *<S {Aga}.> Speak Prince of {Ithaca}, and be't of lesse expect:
530    That matter needlesse of importlesse burthen
531    Diuide thy lips; then we are confident
532    When ranke {Thersites} opes his Masticke iawes,
533    We shall heare Musicke, Wit, and Oracle.
534    <S {Vlys}.> Troy yet vpon his basis had bene downe,
535    And the great {Hectors} sword had lack'd a Master
536    But for these instances.
537    The specialty of Rule hath beene neglected;
538    And looke how many Grecian Tents do stand
539    Hollow vpon this Plaine, so many hollow Factions.
540    When that the Generall is not like the Hiue,
541    To whom the Forragers shall all repaire,
542    What Hony is expected? Degree being vizarded,
543    Th' vnworthiest shewes as fairely in the Maske.
544   *The Heauens themselues, the Planets, and this Center,
545    Obserue degree, priority, and place,
546    Insisture, course, proportion, season, forme,
547    Office, and custome, in all line of Order:
548    And therefore is the glorious Planet Sol
549    In noble eminence, enthron'd, and sphear'd
550    Amid'st the other, whose med'cinable eye
551    Corrects the #ill Aspects of Planets euill,
552    And postes like the Command'ment of a King,
553    Sans checke, to good and bad. But when the Planets
554    In euill mixture to disorder wander,
555    What Plagues, and what portents, what mutiny?
556    What raging of the Sea? shaking of Earth?
557   *Commotion in the Windes? Frights, changes, horrors,
558    Diuert, and cracke, rend and deracinate
559    The vnity, and married calme of States
560    Quite from their fixure? O, when Degree is shak'd,
561    (Which is the Ladder to all high designes)
562    The enterprize is sicke. How could Communities,
563    Degrees in Schooles, and Brother- hoods in Cities,
564    Peacefull Commerce from diuidable shores,
565    The primogenitiue, and due of Byrth,
566    Prerogatiue of Age, Crownes, Scepters, Lawrels,
567    (But by Degree) stand in Authentique place?
568    Take but Degree away, vn- tune that string,
569   *And hearke what Discord followes: each thing meetes
570    In meere oppugnancie. The bounded Waters,
571    Should lift their bosomes higher then the Shores,
572    And make a soppe of all this solid Globe:
573    Strength should be Lord of imbecility,
574    And the rude Sonne should strike his Father dead:
575    Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong,
576    (Betweene whose endlesse iarre, Iustice recides)
577    Should loose her names, and so should Iustice too.
578    Then euery thing includes it selfe in Power,
579    Power into #Will, #Will into Appetite,
580    And Appetite (an vniuersall Wolfe,
581    So doubly seconded with #Will, and Power)
582    Must make perforce an vniuersall prey,
583    And last, eate vp himselfe.
584    Great {Agamemnon}:
585    This Chaos, when Degree is suffocate,
586    Followes the choaking:
587    And this neglection of Degree, is it
588    That by a pace goes backward in a purpose
589    It hath to climbe. The Generall's disdain'd
590    By him one step below; he, by the next,
591    That next, by him beneath: so euery step
592    Exampled by the first pace that is sicke
593    Of his Superiour, growes to an enuious Feauer
594    Of pale, and bloodlesse Emulation.
595    And 'tis this Feauer that keepes Troy on foote,
596    Not her owne sinewes. To end a tale of length,
597    Troy in our weaknesse liues, not in her strength.
598    <S {Nest}.> Most wisely hath {Vlysses} heere discouer'd
599    The Feauer, whereof all our power is sicke.
600    <S {Aga}.> The Nature of the sicknesse found ({Vlysses})
601    What is the remedie?
602    <S {Vlys}.> The great {Achilles}, whom Opinion crownes,
603    The sinew, and the fore- hand of our Hoste,
604    Hauing his eare full of his ayery Fame,
605    Growes dainty of his worth, and in his Tent
606    Lyes mocking our designes. With him, {Patroclus},
607    Vpon a lazie Bed, the liue- long day
608    Breakes scurrill Iests,
609    And with ridiculous and aukward action,
610    (Which Slanderer, he imitation call's)
611    He Pageants vs. Sometime great {Agamemnon},
612    Thy toplesse deputation he puts on;
613    And like a strutting Player, whose conceit
614    Lies in his Ham- string, and doth thinke it rich
615    To heare the woodden Dialogue and sound
616    'Twixt his stretcht footing, and the Scaffolage,
617    Such to be pittied, and ore- rested seeming
618    He acts thy Greatnesse in: and when he speakes,
619   *'Tis like a Chime #a mending. With tearmes vnsquar'd,
620    Which from the tongue of roaring {Typhon} dropt,
621    Would seemes Hyperboles. At this fusty stuffe,
622    The large {Achilles} (on his prest- bed lolling)
623    From his deepe Chest, laughes out a lowd applause,
624    Cries excellent, 'tis {Agamemnon} iust.
625    Now play me {Nestor}; hum, and stroke thy Beard
626    As he, being drest to some Oration:
627    That's done, as neere as the extreamest ends
628    Of paralels; as like, as {Vulcan} and his wife,
629    Yet god {Achilles} still cries excellent,
630    'Tis {Nestor} right. Now play him (me) {Patroclus},
631    Arming to answer in a night- Alarme,
632    And then (forsooth) the faint defects of Age
633    Must be the Scene of myrth, to cough, and spit,
634    And with a palsie fumbling on his Gorget,
635    Shake in and out the Riuet: and at this sport
636    Sir Valour dies; cries, O enough {Patroclus},
637    Or, giue me ribs of Steele, I shall split all
638    In pleasure of my Spleene. And in this fashion,
639    All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
640    Seuerals and generals of grace exact,
641    Atchieuments, plots, orders, preuentions,
642    Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
643    Successe or losse, what is, or is not, serues
644    As stuffe for these two, to make paradoxes.
645    <S {Nest}.> And in the imitation of these twaine,
646    Who (as {Vlysses} sayes) Opinion crownes
647    With an Imperiall voyce, many are infect:
648    {#Aiax} is growne selfe- will'd, and beares his head
649    In such a reyne, in full as proud a place
650    As broad {Achilles}, and keepes his Tent like him;
651    Makes factious Feasts, railes on our state of Warre
      <P YY2>
652    Bold as an Oracle, and sets {Thersites}
653    A slaue, whose Gall coines slanders like a Mint,
654    To match vs in comparisons with durt,
655    To weaken and discredit our exposure,
656    How ranke soeuer rounded in with danger.
657    <S {Vlys}.> They taxe our policy, and call it Cowardice,
658    Count Wisedome as no member of the Warre,
659    Fore- stall prescience, and esteeme no acte
660    But that of hand: The still and mentall parts,
661    That do contriue how many hands shall strike
662    When fitnesse call them on, and know by measure
663    Of their obseruant toyle, the Enemies waight,
664    Why this hath not a fingers dignity:
665    They call this Bed- worke, Mapp'ry, Closset- Warre:
666    So that the Ramme that batters downe the wall,
667    For the great swing and rudenesse of his poize,
668    They place before his hand that made the Engine,
669    Or those that with the finenesse of their soules,
670    By Reason guide his execution.
671    <S {Nest}.> Let this be granted, and {Achilles} horse
672    Makes many {Thetis} sonnes.  <D {Tucket}>
673    <S {Aga}.> What Trumpet? Looke {Menelaus}.
674    <S {Men}.> From Troy.  <D {Enter Aeneas}.>
675    <S {Aga}.> What would you 'fore our Tent?
676    <S {Aene}.> Is this great {Agamemnons} Tent, I pray you?
677    <S {Aga}.> Euen this.
678    <S {Aene}.> May one that is a Herald, and a Prince,
679    Do a faire message to his Kingly eares?
680    <S {Aga}.> With surety stronger then {Achilles} arme,
681    'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voyce
682    Call {Agamemnon} Head and Generall.
683    <S {Aene}.> Faire leaue, and large security. How may
684    A stranger to those most Imperial lookes,
685    Know them from eyes of other Mortals?
686    <S {Aga}.> How?
687    <S {Aene}.> #I: I aske, that I might waken reuerence,
688    And on the cheeke be ready with a blush
689    Modest as morning, when she coldly eyes
690    The youthfull Phoebus:
691    Which is that God in office guiding men?
692    Which is the high and mighty {Agamemnon}?
693    <S {Aga}.> This Troyan scornes vs, or the men of Troy
694    Are ceremonious Courtiers.
695    <S {Aene}.> Courtiers as free, as debonnaire; vnarm'd,
696    As bending Angels; that's their Fame, in peace;
697   *But when they would seeme Souldiers, they haue galles,
698   *Good armes, strong ioynts, true swords, & {Ioues} accord,
699    Nothing so full of heart. But peace {Aeneas},
700    Peace Troyan, lay thy finger on thy lips,
701    The worthinesse of praise distaines his worth:
702    If that he prais'd himselfe, bring the praise forth.
703    But what the repining enemy commends,
704   *That breath Fame blowes, that praise sole pure transce[n]ds.
705    <S {Aga}.> Sir, you of Troy, call you your selfe {Aeneas}?
706    <S {Aene}.> #I Greeke, that is my name.
707    <S {Aga}.> What's your affayre I pray you?
708    <S {Aene}.> Sir pardon, 'tis for {Agamemnons} eares.
709    <S {Aga}.> He heares nought priuatly
710    That comes from Troy.
711    <S {Aene}.> Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him,
712    I bring a Trumpet to awake his eare,
713    To set his sence on the attentiue bent,
714    And then to speake.
715    <S {Aga}.> Speake frankely as the winde,
716    It is not {Agamemnons} sleeping houre;
717    That thou shalt know Troyan he is awake,
718    He tels thee so himselfe.
719    <S {Aene}.> Trumpet blow loud,
720    Send thy Brasse voyce through all these lazie Tents,
721    And euery Greeke of mettle, let him know,
722    What Troy meanes fairely, shall be spoke alowd.
723    <D {The Trumpets sound}.>
724    We haue great {Agamemnon} heere in Troy,
725    A Prince call'd {Hector}, {Priam} is his Father:
726    Who in this dull and long- continew'd Truce
727    Is rusty growne. He bad me take a Trumpet,
728    And to this purpose speake: Kings, Princes, Lords,
729    If there be one among'st the fayr'st of Greece,
730    That holds his Honor higher then his ease,
731    That seekes his praise, more then he feares his perill,
732    That knowes his Valour, and knowes not his feare,
733    That loues his Mistris more then in confession,
734    (With truant vowes to her owne lips he loues)
735    And dare avow her Beauty, and her Worth,
736    In other armes then hers: to him this Challenge.
737    {Hector}, in view of Troyans, and of Greekes,
738    Shall make it good, or do his best to do it.
739    He hath a Lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
740    Then euer Greeke did compasse in his armes,
741    And will to morrow with his Trumpet call,
742    Midway betweene your Tents, and walles of Troy,
743    To rowze a Grecian that is true in loue.
744    If any come, {Hector} shal honour him:
745    If none, hee'l say in Troy when he retyres,
746    The Grecian Dames are sun- burnt, and not worth
747    The splinter of a Lance: Euen so much.
748    <S {Aga}.> This shall be told our Louers Lord {Aeneas},
749    If none of them haue soule in such a kinde,
750    We left them all at home: But we are Souldiers,
751    And may that Souldier a meere recreant proue,
752    That meanes not, hath not, or is not in loue:
753    If then one is, or hath, or meanes to be,
754    That one meets {Hector}; if none else, Ile be he.
755    <S {Nest}.> Tell him of {Nestor}, one that was a man
756    When {Hectors} Grandsire suckt: he is old now,
757    But if there be not in our Grecian mould,
758    One Noble man, that hath one spark of fire
759    To answer for his Loue; tell him from me,
760    Ile hide my Siluer beard in a Gold Beauer,
761    And in my Vantbrace put this wither'd brawne,
762    And meeting him, wil tell him, that my Lady
763    Was fayrer then his Grandame, and as chaste
764    As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
765    Ile pawne this truth with my three drops of blood.
766    <S {Aene}.> Now heauens forbid such scarsitie of youth.
767    <S {Vlys}.> Amen.
768    <S {Aga}.> Faire Lord {Aeneas},
769    Let me touch your hand:
770    To our Pauillion shal I leade you first:
771    {Achilles} shall haue word of this intent,
772    So shall each Lord of Greece from Tent to Tent:
773    Your selfe shall Feast with vs before you goe,
774    And finde the welcome of a Noble Foe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
775    <D {Manet Vlysses, and Nestor}.>
776    <S {Vlys}.> {Nestor}.
777    <S {Nest}.> What sayes {Vlysses}?
778    <S {Vlys}.> I haue a young conception in my braine,
779    Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
780    <S {Nest}.> What is't?
781    <S {Vlysses}.> This 'tis:
782    Blunt wedges riue hard knots: the seeded Pride
783    That hath to this maturity blowne vp
      <P YY2v>
784    In ranke {Achilles}, must or now be cropt,
785    Or shedding breed a Nursery of like euil
786    To ouer- bulke vs all.
787    <S {Nest}.> Wel, and how?
788    <S {Vlys}.> This challenge that the gallant {Hector} sends,
789    How euer it is spred in general name,
790    Relates in purpose onely to {Achilles}.
791    <S {Nest}.> The purpose is perspicuous euen as substance,
792    Whose grossenesse little charracters summe vp,
793    And in the publication make no straine,
794    But that {Achilles}, were his braine as barren
795    As bankes of Lybia, though ({Apollo} knowes)
796    'Tis dry enough, wil with great speede of iudgement,
797    #I, with celerity, finde {Hectors} purpose
798    Pointing on him.
799    <S {Vlys}.> And wake him to the answer, thinke you?
800    <S {Nest}.> Yes, 'tis most meet; who may you else oppose
801    That can from {Hector} bring his Honor off,
802    If not {Achilles}; though't be a sportfull Combate,
803    Yet in this triall, much opinion dwels.
804    For heere the Troyans taste our deer'st repute
805    With their fin'st Pallate: and trust to me {Vlysses},
806    Our imputation shall be oddely poiz'd
807    In this wilde action. For the successe
808    (Although particular) shall giue a scantling
809    Of good or bad, vnto the Generall:
810    And in such Indexes, although small prickes
811    To their subsequent Volumes, there is seene
812    The baby figure of the Gyant- masse
813    Of things to come at large. It is suppos'd,
814    He that meets {Hector}, issues from our choyse;
815    And choise being mutuall acte of all our soules,
816    Makes Merit her election, and doth boyle
817    As 'twere, from forth vs all: a man distill'd
818    Out of our Vertues; who miscarrying,
819    What heart from hence receyues the conqu'ring part
820    To steele a strong opinion to themselues,
821    Which entertain'd, Limbes are in his instruments,
822    In no lesse working, then are Swords and Bowes
823    Directiue by the Limbes.
824    <S {Vlys}.> Giue pardon to my speech:
825    Therefore 'tis meet {Achilles} meet not {Hector}:
826    Let vs (like Merchants) shew our fowlest Wares,
827    And thinke perchance they'l sell: If not,
828    The luster of the better yet to shew,
829    Shall shew the better. Do not consent,
830    That euer {Hector} and {Achilles} meete:
831    For both our Honour, and our Shame in this,
832    Are dogg'd with two strange Followers.
833   *<S {Nest}.> I see them not with my old eies: what are they?
834    <S {Vlys}.> What glory our {Achilles} shares from {Hector},
835    (Were he not proud) we all should weare with him:
836    But he already is too insolent,
837    And we were better parch in Affricke Sunne,
838    Then in the pride and salt scorne of his eyes
839    Should he scape {Hector} faire. If he were foyld,
840    Why then we did our maine opinion crush
841    In taint of our best man. No, make a Lott'ry,
842    And by deuice let blockish {Aiax} draw
843    The sort to fight with {Hector}: Among our selues,
844    Giue him allowance as the worthier man,
845    For that will physicke the great Myrmidon
846    Who broyles in lowd applause, and make him fall
847    His Crest, that prouder then blew Iris bends.
848    If the dull brainlesse {Aiax} come safe off,
849    Wee'l dresse him vp in voyces: if he faile,
850    Yet go we vnder our opinion still,
851    That we haue better men. But hit or misse,
852    Our proiects life this shape of sence assumes,
853    {#Aiax} imploy'd, pluckes downe {Achilles} Plumes.
854    <S {Nest}.> Now {Vlysses}, I begin to rellish thy aduice,
855    And I wil giue a taste of it forthwith
856    To {Agamemnon}, go we to him straight:
857    Two Curres shal tame each other, Pride alone
858    Must tarre the Mastiffes on, as 'twere their bone.  <D {Exeunt}>
859    <D {Enter Aiax, and Thersites}.>
860    <S {Aia}.> {Thersites}?
861   *<S {Ther}.> {Agamemnon}, how if he had Biles (ful) all ouer
862    generally.
863    <S {Aia}.> {Thersites}?
864   *<S {Ther}.> And those Byles did runne, say so; did not the
865    General run, were not that a botchy core?
866    <S {Aia}.> Dogge.
867   *<S {Ther}.> Then there would come some matter from him:
868    I see none now.
869   *<S {Aia}.> Thou Bitch- Wolfes- Sonne, canst y not heare?
870    Feele then.  <D {Strikes him}.>
871   *<S {Ther}.> The plague of Greece vpon thee thou Mungrel
872    beefe- witted Lord.
873   *<S {Aia}.> Speake then you whinid'st leauen speake, I will
874    beate thee into handsomnesse.
875   *<S {Ther}.> I shal sooner rayle thee into wit and holinesse:
876   *but I thinke thy Horse wil sooner con an Oration, then y
877   *learn a prayer without booke: Thou canst strike, canst
878    thou? A red Murren o'thy  Iades trickes.
879    <S {Aia}.> Toads  stoole, learne me the Proclamation.
880   *<S {Ther}.> Doest thou thinke I haue no sence thou strik'st |(me thus?
881    <S {Aia}.> The Proclamation.
882    <S {Ther}.> Thou art proclaim'd a foole, I thinke.
883    <S {Aia}.> Do not Porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
884   *<S {Ther}.> I would thou didst itch from head to foot, and
885   *I had the scratching of thee, I would make thee the loth-som'st
886    scab in Greece.
887    <S {Aia}.> I say the Proclamation.
888   *<S {Ther}.> Thou grumblest & railest euery houre on {A-chilles},
889   *and thou art as ful of enuy at his greatnes, as {Cer-berus}
890   *is at {Proserpina's} beauty. #I, that thou barkst at him.
891    <S {Aia}.> Mistresse {Thersites}.
892    <S {Ther}.> Thou should'st strike him.
893    <S {Aia}.> Coblofe.
894   *<S {Ther}.> He would pun thee into shiuers with his fist, as
895    a Sailor breakes a bisket.
896    <S {Aia}.> You horson Curre.  <S {Ther}.> Do, do.
897    <S {Aia}.> Thou stoole for a Witch.
898   *<S {Ther}.> #I, do, do, thou sodden- witted Lord: thou hast
899   *no more braine then I haue in mine elbows: An Asinico
900   *may tutor thee. Thou scuruy valiant Asse, thou art heere
901   *but to thresh Troyans, and thou art bought and solde a-mong
902   *those of any wit, like a Barbarian slaue. If thou vse
903   *to beat me, I wil begin at thy #heele, and tel what thou art
904    by inches, thou thing of no bowels thou.
905    <S {Aia}.> You dogge.
906    <S {Ther}.> You scuruy Lord.
907    <S {Aia}.> You Curre.
908   *<S {Ther}.> {Mars} his Ideot: do rudenes, do Camell, do, do.
909    <D {Enter Achilles, and Patroclus}.>
910    <S {Achil}.> Why how now {Aiax}? wherefore do you this?
911    How now {Thersites}? what's the matter man?
912    <S {Ther}.> You see him there, do you?
913    <S {Achil}.> #I, what's the matter.
914    <S {Ther}.> Nay looke vpon him.
915    <S {Achil}.> So I do: what's the matter?
      <P YY3>
916    <S {Ther}.> Nay but regard him well.
917    <S {Achil}.> Well, why I do so.
918   *<S {Ther}.> But yet you looke not well vpon him: for who
919    some euer you take him to be, he is {Aiax}.
920    <S {Achil}.> I know that foole.
921    <S {Ther}.> #I, but that foole knowes not himselfe.
922    <S {Aiax}.> Therefore I beate thee.
923   *<S {Ther}.> Lo, lo, lo, lo, what {modicums} of wit he vtters: his
924   *euasions haue eares thus long. I haue bobb'd his Braine
925   *more then he has beate my bones: I will buy nine Spar-rowes
926   *for a peny, and his {Piamater} is not worth the ninth
927   *part of a Sparrow. This Lord ({Achilles}) {Aiax} who wears
928   *his wit in his belly, and his guttes in his head, Ile tell you
929    what I say of him.
930    <S {Achil}.> What?
931    <S {Ther}.> I say this {Aiax}===
932    <S {Achil}.> Nay good {Aiax}.
933    <S {Ther}.> #Has not so much wit.
934    <S {Achil}.> Nay, I must hold you.
935   *<S {Ther}.> As will stop the eye of {Helens} Needle, for whom
936    he comes to fight.
937    <S {Achil}.> Peace foole.
938   *<S {Ther}.> I would haue peace and quietnes, but the foole
939    will not: he there, that #he, looke you there.
940    <S {Aiax}.> O thou damn'd Curre, I shall===
941    <S {Achil}.> Will you set your wit to a Fooles.
942    <S {Ther}.> No I warrant you, for a fooles will shame it.
943    <S {Pat}.> Good words {Thersites}.
944    <S {Achil}.> What's the quarrell?
945   *<S {Aiax}.> I bad #thee vile Owle, goe learne me the tenure
946    of the Proclamation, and he rayles vpon me.
947    <S {Ther}.> I serue thee not.
948    <S {Aiax}.> Well, go too, go #too.
949    <S {Ther}.> I serue heere voluntary.
950   *<S {Achil}.> Your last seruice was sufferance, 'twas not vo-luntary,
951   *no man is beaten voluntary: {Aiax} was heere the
952    voluntary, and you as vnder an Impresse.
953   *<S {Ther}.> E'ne so, a great deale of your wit too lies in your
954   *sinnewes, or else there be Liars. {Hector} shall haue a great
955   *catch, if he knocke out either of your braines, he were as
956    good cracke a fustie nut with no kernell.
957    <S {Achil}.> What with me to {Thersites}?
958   *<S {Ther}.> There's {Vlysses}, and old {Nestor}, whose Wit was
959   *mouldy ere their Grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke
960   *you like draft- Oxen, and make you plough vp the warre.
961    <S {Achil}.> What? what?
962    <S {Ther}.> Yes good sooth, to {Achilles}, to {Aiax}, to===
963    <S {Aiax}.> I shall cut out your tongue.
964   *<S {Ther}.> 'Tis no matter, I shall speake as much as thou
965    afterwards.
966    <S {Pat}.> No more words {Thersites}.
967   *<S {Ther}.> I will hold my peace when {Achilles} Brooch bids
968    me, shall I?
969    <S {Achil}.> There's for you {Patroclus}.
970   *<S {Ther}.> I will see you hang'd like Clotpoles ere I come
971   *any more to your Tents; I will keepe where there is wit
972    stirring, and leaue the faction of fooles.  <D {Exit}.>
973    <S {Pat}.> A good riddance.
974   *<S {Achil}.> Marry this Sir is proclaim'd through al our host,
975    That {Hector} by the fift houre of the Sunne,
976    Will with a Trumpet, 'twixt our Tents and Troy
977    To morrow morning call some Knight to Armes,
978    That hath a stomacke, and such a one that dare
979    Maintaine I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
980    <S {Aiax}.> Farewell? who shall answer him?
981    <S {Achil}.> I know not, 'tis put to Lottry: otherwise
982    He knew his man.
983   *<S {Aiax}.> O meaning you, I wil go learne more of it.  <D {Exit}.>
984    <D {Enter Priam, Hector, Troylus, Paris and Helenus}.>
985    <S {Pri}.> After so many houres, liues, speeches spent,
986    Thus once againe sayes {Nestor} from the Greekes,
987    Deliuer {Helen}, and all damage else
988    (As honour, losse of time, trauaile, expence,
989    Wounds, friends, and what els deere that is consum'd
990    In hot digestion of this comorant Warre)
991    Shall be stroke off. {Hector}, what say you too't.
992   *<S {Hect}.> Though no man lesser feares the Greeks then I,
993    As farre as touches my particular: yet dread {Priam},
994    There is no Lady of more softer bowels,
995    More spungie, to sucke in the sense of Feare,
996    More ready to cry out, who knowes what followes
997    Then {Hector} is: the wound of peace is surety.
998    Surety secure: but modest Doubt is cal'd
999    The Beacon of the wise: the tent that searches
1000   To'th' bottome of the worst. Let {Helen} go,
1001   Since the first sword was drawne about this question,
1002   Euery tythe  soule 'mongst many thousand dismes,
1003   Hath bin as deere as {Helen}: I meane of ours:
1004   If we haue lost so many tenths of ours
1005   To guard a thing not ours, nor worth to vs
1006   (Had it our name) the valew of one ten;
1007   What merit's in that reason which denies
1008   The yeelding of her vp,
1009   <S {Troy}.> Fie, fie, my Brother;
1010   Weigh you the worth and honour of a King
1011   (So great as our dread Father) in a Scale
1012   Of common Ounces? Wil you with Counters summe
1013   The past proportion of his infinite,
1014   And buckle in a waste most fathomlesse,
1015   With spannes and inches so diminutiue,
1016   As feares and reasons? Fie for godly shame?
1017  *<S {Hel}.> No maruel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
1018   You are so empty of them, should not our Father
1019   Beare the great sway of his affayres with reasons,
1020   Because your speech hath none that tels him so.
1021  *<S {Troy}.> You are for dreames & slumbers brother Priest
1022  *You furre your gloues with reason: here are your reasons
1023   You know an enemy intends you harme,
1024   You know, a sword imploy'd is perillous,
1025   And reason flyes the obiect of all harme.
1026   Who maruels then when {Helenus} beholds
1027   A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
1028   The very wings of reason to his heeles:
1029   Or like a Starre disorb'd. Nay, if we talke of Reason,
1030   And flye like chidden Mercurie from Ioue,
1031   Let's shut our gates and sleepe: Manhood and Honor
1032  *Should haue hard hearts, wold they but fat their thoghts
1033   With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect,
1034   Makes Liuers pale, and lustyhood  deiect.
1035   <S {Hect}.> Brother, she is not worth
1036   What she doth cost the holding.
1037   <S {Troy}.> What's aught, but as 'tis valew'd?
1038   <S {Hect}.> But value dwels not in particular #will,
1039   It holds his estimate and dignitie
1040   As well, wherein  'tis precious of it selfe,
1041   As in the prizer: 'Tis made Idolatrie,
1042   To make the seruice greater then the God,
1043   And the #will dotes that is inclineable
1044   To what infectiously it selfe affects,
1045   Without some image of th' affected merit.
1046   <S {Troy}.> I take to day a Wife, and my election
1047   Is led on in the conduct of my #Will;
      <P YY3v>
1048   My #Will enkindled by mine eyes and eares,
1049   Two traded Pylots 'twixt the dangerous shores
1050   Of #Will, and Iudgement. How may I auoyde
1051   (Although my #will distaste what it elected)
1052   The Wife I chose, there can be no euasion
1053   To blench from this, and to stand firme by honour.
1054   We turne not backe the Silkes vpon the Merchant
1055  *When we haue spoyl'd them; nor the remainder Viands
1056   We do not throw in vnrespectiue same,
1057   Because we now are full. It was thought meete
1058   {#Paris} should do some vengeance on the Greekes;
1059   Your breath of full consent bellied his Sailes,
1060   The Seas and Windes (old Wranglers) tooke a Truce,
1061   And did him seruice; he touch'd the Ports desir'd,
1062   And for an old Aunt whom the Greekes held Captiue,
1063  *He brought a Grecian Queen, whose youth & freshnesse
1064   Wrinkles {Apolloes}, and makes stale the morning.
1065   Why keepe we her? the Grecians keepe our Aunt:
1066   Is she worth keeping? Why she is a Pearle,
1067   Whose price hath launch'd aboue a thousand Ships,
1068   And turn'd Crown'd Kings to Merchants.
1069   If you'l auouch, 'twas wisedome {Paris} went,
1070   (As you must needs, for you all cride, Go, go:)
1071   If you'l confesse, he brought home Noble prize,
1072   (As you must needs) for you all clapt your hands,
1073   And cride inestimable; why do you now
1074   The issue of your proper Wisedomes rate,
1075   And do a deed that Fortune neuer did?
1076   Begger the estimation which you priz'd,
1077   Richer then Sea and Land? O Theft most base!
1078   That we haue stolne what we do feare to keepe.
1079   But Theeues vnworthy of a thing so stolne,
1080   That in their Country did them that disgrace,
1081   We feare to warrant in our Natiue place.

1085   <S {Priam}.> What noyse? what shreeke is this?
1086   <S {Troy}.> 'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voyce.
1087   <S {Cas}.> Cry Troyans.
1088   <S {Hect}.> It is {Cassandra}.
1089   <S {Cas}.> Cry Troyans cry; lend me ten thousand eyes,
1090   And I will fill them with Propheticke teares.
1091   <S {Hect}.> Peace sister, peace.
1092   <S {Cas}.> Virgins, and Boyes; mid- age & wrinkled old,
1093   Soft infancie, that nothing can but cry,
1094   Adde to my clamour: let vs pay betimes
1095   A moity of that masse of moane to come.
1096   Cry Troyans cry, practise your eyes with teares,
1097   Troy must not be, nor goodly Illion stand,
1098   Our fire- brand Brother {Paris} burnes vs all.
1099   Cry Troyans cry, a {Helen} and a woe;
1100   Cry, cry, Troy burnes, or else let {Helen} goe.  <D {Exit}.>
1101  *<S {Hect}.> Now youthfull {Troylus}, do not these hie strains
1102   Of diuination in our Sister, worke
1103   Some touches of remorse? Or is your bloud
1104   So madly hot, that no discourse of reason,
1105   Nor feare of bad successe in a bad cause,
1106   Can qualifie the same?
1107   <S {Troy}.> Why Brother {Hector},
1108   We may not thinke the iustnesse of each acte
1109   Such, and no other then euent doth forme it,
1110   Nor once deiect the courage of our mindes;
1111   Because {Cassandra}'s mad, her brainsicke raptures
1112   Cannot distaste the goodnesse of a quarrell,
1113   Which hath our seuerall Honours all engag'd
1114   To make it gracious. For my priuate part,
1115   I am no more touch'd, then all {Priams} sonnes,
1116   And Ioue forbid there should be done among'st vs
1117   Such things as might offend the weakest spleene,
1118   To fight for, and maintaine.
1119   <S {Par}.> Else might the world conuince of leuitie,
1120   As well my vnder- takings as your counsels:
1121   But I attest the gods, your full consent
1122   Gaue wings to my propension, and cut off
1123   All feares attending on so dire a proiect.
1124   For what (alas) can these my single armes?
1125   What propugnation is in one mans valour
1126   To stand the push and enmity of those
1127   This quarrell would excite? Yet I protest,
1128   Were I alone to passe the difficulties,
1129   And had as ample power, as I haue #will,
1130   {#Paris} should ne're retract what he hath done,
1131   Nor faint in the pursuite.
1132   <S {Pri}.> {Paris}, you speake
1133   Like one be- sotted on your sweet delights;
1134   You haue the Hony still, but these the Gall,
1135   So to be valiant, is no praise at all.
1136   <S {Par}.> Sir, I propose not meerely to my selfe,
1137   The pleasures such a beauty brings with it:
1138   But I would haue the soyle of her faire Rape
1139   Wip'd off in honourable keeping her.
1140   What Treason were it to the ransack'd Queene,
1141   Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
1142   Now to deliuer her possession vp
1143   On termes of base compulsion? Can it be,
1144   That so degenerate a straine as this,
1145   Should once set footing in your generous bosomes?
1146   There's not the meanest spirit on our partie,
1147   Without a heart to dare, or sword to draw,
1148   When {Helen} is defended: nor none so Noble,
1149   Whose life were #ill bestow'd, or death vnfam'd,
1150   Where {Helen} is the subiect. Then (I say)
1151   Well may we fight for her, whom we know well,
1152   The worlds large spaces cannot paralell.
1153   <S {Hect}.> {Paris} and {Troylus}, you haue both said well:
1154   And on the cause and question now in hand,
1155   Haue gloz'd, but superficially; not much
1156   Vnlike young men, whom {Aristotle} thought
1157   Vnfit to heare Morall Philosophie.
1158   The Reasons you alledge, do more conduce
1159   To the hot passion of distemp'red blood,
1160   Then to make vp a free determination
1161   'Twixt right and wrong: For pleasure, and reuenge,
1162   Haue eares more deafe then Adders, to the voyce
1163   Of any true decision. Nature craues
1164   All dues be rendred to their Owners: now
1165   What neerer debt in all humanity,
1166   Then Wife is to the Husband? If this law
1167   Of Nature be corrupted through affection,
1168   And that great mindes of partiall indulgence,
1169   To their benummed wills resist the same,
1170   There is a Law in each well- ordred Nation,
1171   To curbe those raging appetites that are
1172   Most disobedient and refracturie.
1173   If {Helen} then be wife to Sparta's King
1174   (As it is knowne she is) these Morall Lawes
1175   Of Nature, and of Nation, speake alowd
1176   To haue her backe return'd. Thus to persist
1177   In doing wrong, extenuates not wrong,
1178   But makes it much more heauie. {Hectors} opinion
      <P YY4><C J>
1179   Is this in way of truth: yet nere the lesse,
1180   My spritely brethren, I propend to you
1181   In resolution to keepe {Helen} still;
1182   For 'tis a cause that hath no meane dependance,
1183   Vpon our ioynt and seuerall dignities.
1184   <S {Tro}.> Why? there you toucht the life of our designe:
1185   Were it not glory that we more affected,
1186   Then the performance of our heauing spleenes,
1187   I would not wish a drop of {Troian} blood,
1188   Spent more in her defence. But worthy {Hector},
1189   She is a theame of honour and renowne,
1190   A spurre to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
1191   Whose present courage may beate downe our foes,
1192   And fame in time to come canonize vs.
1193   For I presume braue {Hector} would not loose
1194   So rich aduantage of a promis'd glory,
1195   As smiles vpon the fore- head of this action,
1196   For the wide worlds reuenew.
1197   <S {Hect}.> I am yours,
1198   You valiant off- spring of great {Priamus},
1199   I haue a roisting challenge sent among'st
1200   The dull and factious nobles of the Greekes,
1201   Will strike amazement to their drowsie spirits,
1202   I was aduertiz'd, their Great generall slept,
1203   Whil'st emulation in the armie crept:
1204   This I presume will wake him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1205   <D {Enter} Thersites {solus}.>
1206  *How now {Thersites}? what lost in the Labyrinth of thy
1207  *furie? shall the Elephant {Aiax} carry it thus? he beates
1208  *me, and I raile at him: O worthy satisfaction, would it
1209  *were otherwise: that I could beate him, whil'st he rail'd
1210  *at me: Sfoote, Ile learne to coniure and raise Diuels, but
1211  *Ile see some issue of my spitefull execrations. Then ther's
1212  *{Achilles}, a rare Enginer. If {Troy} be not taken till these two
1213  *vndermine it, the wals will stand till they fall of them-selues.
1214  *O thou great thunder- darter of Olympus, forget
1215  *that thou art {Ioue} the King of gods: and {Mercury}, loose
1216  *all the Serpentine craft of thy Caduceus, if thou take not
1217  *that little little lesse then little wit from them that they
1218  *haue, which short- arm'd ignorance it selfe knowes, is so
1219  *abundant scarse, it will not in circumuention deliuer a
1220  *Flye from a Spider, without drawing the massie Irons and
1221  *cutting the web: after this, the vengeance on the whole
1222  *Camp, or rather the bone- ach, for that me thinkes is the
1223  *curse dependant on those that warre for a placket. I haue
1224  *said my prayers and diuell, enuie, say Amen: What ho?
1225   my Lord {Achilles}?
1226   <D {Enter Patroclus}.>
1227  *<S {Patr}.> Who's there? {Thersites}. Good {Thersites} come
1228   in and raile.
1229  *<S {Ther}.> If I could haue remembred a guilt counterfeit,
1230  *thou would'st not haue slipt out of my contemplation,
1231  *but it is no matter, thy selfe vpon thy selfe. The common
1232  *curse of mankinde, follie and ignorance be thine in great
1233  *reuenew; heauen blesse thee from a Tutor, and Discipline
1234  *come not neere thee. Let thy bloud be thy direction till
1235  *thy death, then if she that laies thee out sayes thou art a
1236  *faire coarse, Ile be sworne and sworne vpon't she neuer
1237   shrowded any but Lazars, Amen. Wher's {Achilles}?
1238   <S {Patr}.> What art thou deuout? wast thou in a prayer?
1239   <S {Ther}.> #I, the heauens heare me.
1240   <D {Enter Achilles}.>
1241   <S {Achil}.> Who's there?
1242   <S {Patr}.> {Thersites}, my Lord.
1243  *<S {Achil}.> Where, where, art thou come? why my cheese,
1244  *my digestion, why hast thou not seru'd thy selfe into my
1245   Table, so many meales? Come, what's {Agamemnon}?
1246  *<S {Ther}.> Thy Commander {Achilles}, then tell me {Patro-clus},
1247   what's {Achilles}?
1248  *<S {Patr}.> Thy Lord {Thersites}: then tell me I pray thee,
1249   what's thy selfe?
1250  *<S {Ther}.> Thy knower {Patroclus}: then tell me {Patroclus},
1251   what art thou?
1252   <S {Patr}.> Thou maist tell that know'st.
1253   <S {Achil}.> O tell, tell.
1254  *<S {Ther}.> Ile declin the whole question: {Agamemnon} com-mands
1255  *{Achilles, Achilles} is my Lord, I am {Patroclus} know-er,
1256   and {Patroclus} is a foole.
1257   <S {Patro}.> You rascall.
1258   <S {Ther}.> Peace foole, I haue not done.
1259   <S {Achil}.> He is a priuiledg'd man, proceede {Thersites}.
1260  *<S {Ther}.> {Agamemnon} is a foole, {Achilles} is a foole, {Ther-sites}
1261   is a foole, and as aforesaid, {Patroclus} is a foole.
1262   <S {Achil}.> Deriue this? come?
1263  *<S {Ther}.> {Agamemnon} is a foole to offer to command {A-chilles},
1264  *{Achilles} is a foole to be commanded of {Agamemnon},
1265  *{Thersites} is a foole to serue such a foole: and {Patroclus} is a
1266   foole positiue.
1267   <S {Patr}.> Why am I a foole?
1268   <D {Enter Agamemnon, Vlisses, Nestor, Diomedes},
1269   {#Aiax, and Chalcas}.>
1270  *<S {Ther}.> Make that demand to the Creator, it suffises me
1271   thou art. Looke you, who comes here?
1272  *<S {Achil}.> {Patroclus}, Ile speake with no body: come in
1273   with me {Thersites}. <D {Exit}.>
1274  *<S {Ther}.> Here is such patcherie, such iugling, and such
1275  *knauerie: all the argument is a Cuckold and a Whore, a
1276  *good quarrel to draw emulations, factions, and bleede to
1277  *death vpon: Now the dry Suppeago on the Subiect, and
1278   Warre and Lecherie confound all.
1279   <S {Agam}.> Where is {Achilles}?
1280   <S {Patr}.> Within his Tent, but #ill dispos'd my Lord.
1281   <S {Agam}.> Let it be knowne to him that we are here:
1282   He sent our Messengers, and we lay by
1283   Our appertainments, visiting of him:
1284   Let him be told of, so perchance he thinke
1285   We dare not moue the question of our place,
1286   Or know not what we are.
1287   <S {Pat}.> I shall so say to him.
1288   <S {Vlis}.> We saw him at the opening of his Tent,
1289   he is not sicke.
1290  *<S {Aia}.> Yes, Lyon sicke, sicke of proud heart; you may
1291  *call it Melancholly if will fauour the man, but by my
1292  *head, it is pride; but why, why, let him show vs the cause?
1293   A word my Lord.
1294   <S {Nes}.> What moues {Aiax} thus to bay at him?
1295   <S {Vlis}.> {Achilles} hath inueigled his Foole from him.
1296   <S {Nes}.> Who, {Thersites}?
1297   <S {Vlis}.> He.
1298  *<S {Nes}.> Then will {Aiax} lacke matter, if he haue lost his
1299   Argument.
1300  *<S {Vlis}.> No, you see he is his argument that has his argu-ment
1301   {Achilles}.
1302  *<S {Nest}.> All the better, their fraction is more our wish
1303  *then their faction; but it was a strong counsell that a
1304   Foole could disunite.
1305  *<S {Vlis}.> The amitie that wisedome knits, not folly may
1306   easily vntie.  <D {Enter Patroclus}.>
      <P YY4v>
1307   Here comes {Patroclus}.
1308   <S {Nes}.> No {Achilles} with him?
1309  *<S {Vlis}.> The Elephant hath ioynts, but none for curtesie:
1310   His legge are legs for necessitie, not for flight.
1311   <S {Patro}.> {Achilles} bids me say he is much sorry:
1312   If any thing more then your sport and pleasure,
1313   Did moue your greatnesse, and this noble State,
1314   To call vpon him; he hopes it is no other,
1315   But for your health, and your digestion sake;
1316   An after Dinners breath.
1317   <S {Aga}.> Heare you {Patroclus}:
1318   We are too well acquainted with these answers:
1319   But his euasion winged thus swift with scorne,
1320   Cannot but flye our apprehensions.
1321   Much attribute he hath, and much the reason,
1322   Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his vertues,
1323   Not vertuously of his owne part beheld,
1324   Doe in our eyes, begin to loose their glosse;
1325   Yea, and like faire Fruit in an vnholdsome dish,
1326   Are like to rot vntasted: goe and tell him,
1327   We came to speake with him; and you shall not sinne,
1328   If you doe say, we thinke him ouer proud,
1329   And vnder honest; in selfe- assumption greater
1330  *Then in the note of iudgement: & worthier then himselfe
1331   Here tends the sauage strangenesse he puts on,
1332   Disguise the holy strength of their command:
1333   And vnder write in an obseruing kinde
1334   His humorous predominance, yea watch
1335   His pettish lines, his ebs, his flowes, as if
1336   The passage and whole carriage of this action
1337   Rode on his tyde. Goe tell him this, and adde,
1338   That if he ouerhold his price so much,
1339   Weele none of him; but let him, like an Engin
1340   Not portable, lye vnder this report.
1341   Bring action hither, this cannot goe to warre:
1342   A stirring Dwarfe, we doe allowance giue,
1343   Before a sleeping Gyant: tell him so.
1344   <S {Pat}.> I shall, and bring his answer presently.
1345   <S {Aga}.> In second voyce weele not be satisfied,
1346   We come to speake with him, {Vlisses} enter you.
1347   <D {Exit Vlisses}.>
1348   <S {Aiax}.> What is he more then another?
1349   <S {Aga}.> No more then what he thinkes he is.
1350  *<S {Aia}.> Is he so much, doe you not thinke, he thinkes
1351   himselfe a better man then I am?
1352   <S {Ag}.> No question.
1353   <S {Aiax}.> Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
1354  *<S {Ag}.> No, Noble {Aiax}, you are as strong, as valiant, as
1355  *wise, no lesse noble, much more gentle, and altogether
1356   more tractable.
1357  *<S {Aiax}.> Why should a man be proud? How doth pride
1358   grow? I know not what it is.
1359  *<S {Aga}.> Your minde is the cleerer {Aiax}, and your vertues
1360  *the fairer; he that is proud, eates vp himselfe; Pride is his
1361  *owne Glasse, his owne trumpet, his owne Chronicle, and
1362  *what euer praises it selfe but in the deede, deuoures the
1363   deede in the praise.
1364   <D {Enter Vlysses}.>
1365  *<S {Aiax}.> I do hate a proud man, as I hate the ingendring
1366   of Toades.
1367   <S {Nest}.> Yet he loues himselfe: is't not strange?
1368   <S {Vlis}.> {Achilles} will not to the field to morrow.
1369   <S {Ag}.> What's his excuse?
1370   <S {Vlis}.> He doth relye on none,
1371   But carries on the streame of his dispose,
1372   Without oberuance or respect of any,
1373   In #will peculiar, and in selfe admission.
1374   <S {Aga}.> Why, will he not vpon our faire request,
1375   Vntent his person, and share the ayre with vs?
1376  *<S {Vlis}.> Things small as nothing, for requests sake onely
1377   He makes important; possest he is with greatnesse,
1378   And speakes not to himselfe, but with a pride
1379   That quarrels at selfe- breath. Imagin'd wroth
1380   Holds in his bloud such swolne and hot discourse,
1381   That twixt his mentall and his actiue parts,
1382   Kingdom'd {Achilles} in commotion rages,
1383   And batters gainst it selfe; what should I say?
1384   He is so plaguy proud, that the death tokens of it,
1385   Cry no recouery.
1386   <S {Ag}.> Let {Aiax} goe to him.
1387   Deare Lord, goe you and greete him in his Tent;
1388   'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
1389   At your request a little from himselfe.
1390   <S {Vlis}.> O {Agamemnon}, let it not be so.
1391   Weele consecrate the steps that {Aiax} makes,
1392   When they goe from {Achilles}; shall the proud Lord,
1393   That bastes his arrogance with his owne seame,
1394   And neuer suffers matter of the world,
1395   Enter his thoughts: saue such as doe reuolue
1396   And ruminate himselfe. Shall he be worshipt,
1397   Of that we hold an Idoll, more then hee?
1398   No, this thrice worthy and right valiant Lord,
1399   Must not so staule his Palme, nobly acquir'd,
1400   Nor by my #will assubiugate his merit,
1401   As amply titled as {Achilles} is: by going to {Achilles},
1402   That were to enlard his fat already, pride,
1403   And adde more Coles to Cancer, when he burnes
1404   With entertaining great {Hiperion}.
1405   This L[ord]. goe to him? {Iupiter} forbid,
1406   And say in thunder, {Achilles} goe to him.
1407   <S {Nest}.> O this is well, he rubs the veine of him.
1408   <S {Dio}.> And how his silence drinkes vp this applause.
1409  *<S {Aia}.> If I goe to him, with my armed fist, Ile pash him
1410   ore the face.
1411   <S {Ag}.> O no, you shall not goe.
1412  *<S {Aia}.> #And #a be proud with me, ile phese his pride: let
1413   me goe to him.
1414  *<S {Vlis}.> Not for the worth that hangs vpon our quarrel.
1415   <S {Aia}.> A paultry insolent fellow.
1416   <S {Nest}.> How he describes himselfe.
1417   <S {Aia}.> Can he not be sociable?
1418   <S {Vlis}.> The Rauen chides blacknessse.
1419   <S {Aia}.> He let his humours bloud.
1420  *<S {Ag}.> He will be the Physitian that should be the pa-tient.
1421  _
1422   <S {Aia}.> #And all men were #a my minde.
1423   <S {Vlis}.> Wit would be out of fashion.
1424  *<S {Aia}.> #A should not beare it so, #a should eate Swords
1425   first: shall pride carry it?
1426   <S {Nest}.> #And 'twould, you'ld carry halfe.
1427   <S {Vlis}.> #A would haue ten shares.
1428  *<S {Aia}.> I will knede him, Ile make him supple, hee's not
1429   yet through warme.
1430  *<S {Nest}.> Force him with praises, poure in, poure in: his am-bition
1431   is dry.
1432   <S {Vlis}.> My L[ord]. you feede too much on this dislike.
1433   <S {Nest}.> Our noble Generall, doe not doe so.
1434   <S {Diom}.> You must prepare to fight without {Achilles}.
1435   <S {Vlis}.> Why, 'tis this naming of him doth him harme.
1436   Here is a man, but 'tis before his face,
1437   I will be silent.
1438   <S {Nest}.> Wherefore should you so?
      <P YY5>
1439   He is not emulous, as {Achilles} is.
1440   <S {Vlis}.> 'Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
1441  *<S {Aia}.> A horson dog, that shal palter thus with vs, would
1442   he were a {Troian}.
1443   <S {Nest}.> What a vice were it in {Aiax} now===
1444   <S {Vlis}.> If he were proud.
1445   <S {Dio}.> Or couetous of praise.
1446   <S {Vlis}.> #I, or surley borne.
1447   <S {Dio}.> Or strange, or selfe affected.
1448  *<S {Vl}.> Thank the heauens L[ord]. thou art of sweet composure;
1449   Praise him that got thee, she that gaue thee sucke:
1450   Fame be thy Tutor, and thy parts of nature
1451   Thrice fam'd beyond, beyond all erudition;
1452   But he that disciplin'd thy armes to fight,
1453   Let {Mars} deuide Eternity in twaine,
1454   And giue him halfe, and for thy vigour,
1455   Bull- bearing {Milo}: his addition yeelde
1456   To sinnowie {Aiax}: I will not praise thy wisdome,
1457   Which like a bourne, a pale, a shore confines
1458   Thy spacious and dilated parts; here's {Nestor}
1459   Instructed by the Antiquary times:
1460   He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.
1461   But pardon Father {Nestor}, were your dayes
1462   As greene as {Aiax}, and your braine so temper'd,
1463   You should not haue the eminence of him,
1464   But be as {Aiax}.
1465   <S {Aia}.> Shall I call you Father?
1466   <S {Vlis}.> #I my good Sonne.
1467   <S {Dio}.> Be rul'd by him Lord {Aiax}.
1468   <S {Vlis}.> There is no tarrying here, the Hart {Achilles}
1469   Keepes thicket: please it our Generall,
1470   To call together all his state of warre,
1471   Fresh Kings are come to {Troy}; to morrow
1472   We must with all our maine of power stand fast:
1473   And here's a Lord, come Knights from East to West,
1474   And cull their flowre, {Aiax} shall cope the best.
1475   <S {Ag}.> Goe we to Counsaile, let {Achilles} sleepe;
1476  *Light Botes may saile swift, though greater bulkes draw
1477   deepe.  <D {Exeunt.  Musicke sounds within}.>
1478   <D {Enter Pandarus and a Seruant}.>
1479  *<S {Pan}.> Friend, you, pray you a word: Doe not you fol-low
1480   the yong Lord {Paris}?
1481   <S {Ser}.> #I sir, when he goes before me.
1482   <S {Pan}.> You depend vpon him I meane?
1483   <S {Ser}.> Sir, I doe depend vpon the Lord.
1484  *<S {Pan}.> You depend vpon a noble Gentleman: I must
1485   needes praise him.
1486   <S {Ser}.> The Lord be praised.
1487   <S {Pa}.> You know me, doe you not?
1488   <S {Ser}.> Faith sir, superficially.
1489  *<S {Pa}.> Friend know me better, I am the Lord {Pandarus}.
1490   <S {Ser}.> I hope I shall know your honour better.
1491   <S {Pa}.> I doe desire it.
1492   <S {Ser}.> You are in the state of Grace?
1493  *<S {Pa}.> Grace, not so friend, honor and Lordship are my
1494   title: What Musique is this?
1495   <S {Ser}.> I doe but partly know sir: it is Musicke in parts.
1496   <S {Pa}.> Know you the Musitians.
1497   <S {Ser}.> Wholly sir.
1498   <S {Pa}.> Who play they to?
1499   <S {Ser}.> To the hearers sir.
1500   <S {Pa}.> At whose pleasure friend?
1501   <S {Ser}.> At mine sir, and theirs that loue Musicke.
1502   <S {Pa}.> Command, I meane friend.
1503   <S {Ser}.> Who shall I command sir?
1504  *<S {Pa}.> Friend, we vnderstand not one another: I am too
1505  *courtly, and thou art too cunning. At whose request doe
1506   these men play?
1507  *<S {Ser}.> That's too't indeede sir: marry sir, at the request
1508  *of {Paris} my L[ord]. who's there in person; with him the mor-tall
1509  *{Venus}, the heart bloud of beauty, loues inuisible
1510   soule.
1511   <S {Pa}.> Who? my Cosin {Cressida}.
1512  *<S {Ser}.> No sir, {Helen}, could you not finde out that by
1513   her attributes?
1514  *<S {Pa}.> It should seeme fellow, that thou hast not seen the
1515  *Lady {Cressida}. I come to speake with {Paris} from the
1516  *Prince {Troylus}: I will make a complementall  assault vpon
1517   him, for my businesse seethes.
1518  *<S {Ser}.> Sodden businesse, there's a stewed phrase indeede.
1519   <D {Enter Paris and Helena}.>
1520  *<S {Pan}.> Faire be to you my Lord, and to all this faire com-pany:
1521  *faire desires in all faire measure fairely guide them,
1522  *especially to you faire Queene, faire thoughts be your
1523   faire pillow.
1524   <S {Hel}.> Deere L[ord]. you are full of faire words.
1525  *<S {Pan}.> You speake your faire pleasure sweete Queene:
1526   faire Prince, here is good broken Musicke.
1527  *<S {Par}.> You haue broke it cozen: and by my life you
1528  *shall make it whole againe, you shall peece it out with a
1529   peece of your performance. {Nel}, he is full of harmony.
1530   <S {Pan}.> Truely Lady no.
1531   <S {Hel}.> O sir.
1532   <S {Pan}.> Rude in sooth, in good sooth very rude.
1533   <S {Paris}.> Well said my Lord: well, you say so in fits.
1534  *<S {Pan}.> I haue businesse to my Lord, deere Queene: my
1535   Lord will you vouchsafe me a word.
1536  *<S {Hel}.> Nay, this shall not hedge vs out, weele heare you
1537   sing certainely.
1538  *<S {Pan}.> Well sweete Queene you are pleasant with me,
1539  *but, marry thus my Lord, my deere Lord, and most estee-med
1540   friend your brother {Troylus}.
1541   <S {Hel}.> My Lord {Pandarus}, hony sweete Lord.
1542   <S {Pan}.> Go #too sweete Queene, goe to.
1543   Commends himselfe most affectionately to you.
1544   <S {Hel}.> You shall not bob vs out of our melody:
1545   If you doe, our melancholly vpon your head.
1546  *<S {Pan}.> Sweete Queene, sweete Queene, that's a sweete
1547   Queene Ifaith===
1548  *<S {Hel}.> And to make a sweet Lady sad, is a sower offence.
1549  *<S {Pan}.> Nay, that shall not serue your turne, that shall it
1550  *not in truth la. Nay, I care not for such words, no, no.
1551  *And my Lord he desires you, that if the King call for him
1552   at Supper, you will make his excuse.
1553   <S {Hel}.> My Lord {Pandarus}?
1554  *<S {Pan}.> What saies my sweete Queene, my very, very
1555   sweete Queene?
1556  *<S {Par}.> What exploit's in hand, where sups he to night?
1557   <S {Hel}.> Nay but my Lord?
1558  *<S {Pan}.> What saies my sweete Queene? my cozen will
1559   fall out with you.
1560   <S {Hel}.> You must not know where he sups.
1561   <S {Par}.> With my disposer {Cressida}.
1562  *<S {Pan}.> No, no; no such matter, you are wide, come your
1563   disposer is sicke.
1564   <S {Par}.> Well, Ile make excuse.
1565  *<S {Pan}.> #I good my Lord: why should you say {Cressida}?
1566   no, your poore disposer's sicke.
1567   <S {Par}.> I spie.
      <P YY5v><C U>
1568  *<S {Pan}.> You spie, what doe you spie: come, giue me an
1569   Instrument now sweete Queene.
1570   <S {Hel}.> Why this is kindely done?
1571  *<S {Pan}.> My Neece is horrible in loue with a thing you
1572   haue sweete Queene.
1573  *<S {Hel}.> She shall haue it my Lord, if it be not my Lord
1574   {Paris}.
1575  *<S {Pand}.> Hee? no, sheele none of him, they two are
1576   twaine.
1577  *<S {Hel}.> Falling in after falling out, may make them three.
1578  *<S {Pan}.> Come, come, Ile heare no more of this, Ile sing
1579   you a song now.
1580  *<S {Hel}.> #I, #I, prethee now: by my troth sweet Lord thou
1581   hast a fine fore- head.
1582   <S {Pan}.> #I you may, you may.
1583  *<S {Hel}.> Let thy song be loue: this loue will vndoe vs al.
1584   Oh {Cupid, Cupid, Cupid}.
1585   <S {Pan}.> Loue? #I that it shall yfaith.
1586   <S {Par}.> #I, good now loue, loue, no thing  but loue.
1587   <S {Pan}.> In good troth it begins so.
1588   {Loue, loue, nothing but loue, still more}:
1589   {For O loues Bow},
1590   {Shootes Bucke and #Doe}:
1591   {The Shaft confounds not that it wounds},
1592   {But tickles still the sore}:
1593   {These Louers cry, oh ho they dye};
1594   {Yet that which seemes the wound to kill},
1595   {Doth turne oh ho, to ha ha #he}:
1596   {So dying loue liues still},
1597   {Oh ho #a while, but ha ha ha},
1598   {O he grones out for ha ha ha === hey ho}.
1599   <S {Hel}.> In loue yfaith to the very tip of the nose.
1600  *<S {Par}.> He eates nothing but doues loue, and that breeds
1601  *hot bloud, and hot bloud begets hot thoughts, and hot
1602   thoughts beget hot deedes, and hot deedes is loue.
1603  *<S {Pan}.> Is this the generation of loue? Hot bloud, hot
1604   thoughts, and hot deedes, why they are Vipers, is Loue a
1605   generation of Vipers?
1606   Sweete Lord, whose #a field to day?
1607  *<S {Par}.> {Hector, Deiphoebus, Helenus, Anthenor}, and all the
1608  *gallantry of {Troy}. I would faine haue arm'd to day, but
1609   my {Nell} would not haue it so.
1610   How chance my brother {Troylus} went not?
1611  *<S {Hel}.> He hangs the lippe at something; you know all
1612   Lord {Pandarus}?
1613  *<S {Pan}.> Not I hony sweete Queene: I long to heare how
1614   they sped to day:
1615   Youle remember your brothers excuse?
1616   <S {Par}.> To a hayre.
1617   <S {Pan}.> Farewell sweete Queene.
1618   <S {Hel}.> Commend me to your Neece.
1619   <S {Pan}.> I will sweete Queene.  <D {Sound a retreat}.>
1620  *<S {Par}.> They're come from fielde: let vs to {Priams} Hall
1621   To greete the Warriers. Sweet {Hellen}, I must woe you,
1622   To helpe vnarme our {Hector}: his stubborne Buckles,
1623   With these your white enchanting fingers toucht,
1624   Shall more obey then to the edge of Steele,
1625   Or force of Greekish sinewes: you shall doe more
1626   Then all the Iland Kings, disarme great {Hector}.
1627   <S {Hel}.> 'Twill make vs proud to be his seruant {Paris}:
1628   Yea what he shall receiue of vs in duetie,
1629   Giues vs more palme in beautie then we haue:
1630   Yea ouershines our selfe.
1631   Sweete aboue thought I loue thee.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1632   <D {Enter Pandarus and Troylus Man}.>
1633  *<S {Pan}.> How now, where's thy Maister, at my Couzen
1634   {Cressidas}?
1635  *<S {Man}.> No sir, he stayes for you to conduct him thither.
1636   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
1637   <S {Pan}.> O here he comes: How now, how now?
1638   <S {Troy}.> Sirra walke off.
1639   <S {Pan}.> Haue you seene my Cousin?
1640   <S {Troy}.> No {Pandarus}: I stalke about her doore
1641   Like a strange soule vpon the Stigian bankes
1642   Staying for waftage. O be thou my {Charon},
1643   And giue me swift transportance to those fields,
1644   Where I may wallow in the Lilly beds
1645   Propos'd for the deseruer. O gentle {Pandarus},
1646   From {Cupids} shoulder plucke his painted wings,
1647   And flye with me to {Cressid}.
1648  *<S {Pan}.> Walke here ith 'Orchard, Ile bring her straight.
1649   <D {Exit Pandarus}.>
1650   <S {Troy}.> I am giddy; expectation whirles me round,
1651   Th' imaginary relish is so sweete,
1652   That it inchants my sence: what will it be
1653   When that the watry pallats taste indeede
1654   Loues thrice reputed Nectar? Death I feare me
1655   Sounding distruction, or some ioy too fine,
1656   Too subtile, potent, and too sharpe in sweetnesse,
1657   For the capacitie of my ruder powers;
1658   I feare it much, and I doe feare besides,
1659   That I shall loose distinction in my ioyes,
1660   As doth a battaile, when they charge on heapes
1661   The enemy flying.  <D {Enter Pandarus}.>
1662  *<S {Pan}.> Shee's making her ready, sheele come straight; you
1663  *must be witty now, she does so blush, & fetches her winde
1664  *so short, as if she were fraid with a sprite: Ile fetch her; it
1665  *is the prettiest villaine, she fetches her breath so short as a
1666   new tane Sparrow.  <D {Exit Pand}.>
1667   <S {Troy}.> Euen such a passion doth imbrace my bosome:
1668   My heart beates thicker then a feauorous pulse,
1669   And all my powers doe their bestowing loose,
1670   Like vassalage at vnawares encountring
1671   The eye of Maiestie.
1672   <D {Enter Pandarus and Cressida}.>
1673   <S {Pan}.> Come, come, what neede you blush?
1674  *Shames a babie; here she is now, sweare the oathes now
1675  *to her, that you haue sworne to me. What are you gone a-gaine,
1676  *you must be watcht ere you be made tame, must
1677  *you? come your wayes, come your wayes, #and you draw
1678  *backward weele put you i'th fils: why doe you not speak
1679  *to her? Come draw this curtaine, & let's see your picture.
1680  *Alasse the day, how loath you are to offend day light? #and
1681  *'twere darke you'ld close sooner: So, so, rub on, and kisse
1682  *the mistresse; how now, a kisse in fee- farme? build there
1683  *Carpenter, the ayre is sweete. Nay, you shall fight your
1684  *hearts out ere I part you. The Faulcon, as the Tercell, for
1685   all the Ducks ith Riuer: go #too, go #too.
1686   <S {Troy}.> You haue bereft me of all words Lady.
1687  *<S {Pan}.> Words pay no debts; giue her deedes: but sheele
1688  *bereaue you o'th' deeds too, if shee call your actiuity in
1689  *question: what billing againe? here's in witnesse where-of
1690  *the Parties interchangeably. Come in, come in, Ile go
1691   get a fire?
1692   <S {Cres}.> Will you walke in my Lord?
1693   <S {Troy}.> O {Cressida}, how often haue I wisht me thus?
1694  *<S {Cres}.> Wisht my Lord? the gods grant? O my Lord.
1695  *<S {Troy}.> What should they grant? what makes this pret-ty
1696  *abruption: what too curious dreg espies my sweete La-dy
1697   in the fountaine of our loue?
      <P YY6><C J>
1698   <S {Cres}.> More dregs then water, if my teares haue eyes.
1699  *<S {Troy}.> Feares make diuels of Cherubins, they neuer see
1700   truely.
1701  *<S {Cres}.> Blinde feare, that seeing reason leads, findes safe
1702  *footing, then blinde reason, stumbling without feare: to
1703   feare the worst, oft cures the worse.
1704   <S {Troy}.> Oh let my Lady apprehend no feare,
1705   In all {Cupids} Pageant there is presented no monster.
1706   <S {Cres}.> Not nothing monstrous neither?
1707  *<S {Troy}.> Nothing but our vndertakings, when we vowe
1708  *to weepe seas, liue in fire, eate rockes, tame Tygers; think-ing
1709  *it harder for our Mistresse to deuise imposition
1710  *inough, then for vs to vndergoe any difficultie imposed.
1711  *This is the monstruositie in loue Lady, that the #will is in-finite,
1712  *and the execution confin'd; that the desire is bound-lesse,
1713   and the act a slaue to limit.
1714  *<S {Cres}.> They say all Louers sweare more performance
1715  *then they are able, and yet reserue an ability that they
1716  *neuer performe: vowing more then the perfection of ten;
1717  *and discharging lesse then the tenth part of one. They
1718  *that haue the voyce of Lyons, and the act of Hares: are
1719   they not Monsters?
1720  *<S {Troy}.> Are there such? such are not we: Praise vs as we
1721  *are tasted, allow vs as we proue: our head shall goe bare
1722  *till merit crowne it: no perfection in reuersion shall haue
1723  *a praise in present: wee will not name desert before his
1724  *birth, and being borne his addition shall be humble: few
1725  *words to faire faith. {Troylus} shall be such to {Cressid}, as
1726  *what enuie can say worst, shall be a mocke for his truth;
1727  *and what truth can speake truest, not truer then {Troy-lus}.
1728  _
1729   <S {Cres}.> Will you walke in my Lord?
1730   <D {Enter Pandarus}.>
1731  *<S {Pan}.> What blushing still? haue you not done talking
1732   yet?
1733  *<S {Cres}.> Wel! Vnckle, what folly I commit, I dedicate
1734   to you.
1735  *<S {Pan}.> I thanke you for that: if my Lord get a Boy of
1736  *you, youle giue him me: be true to my Lord, if he flinch,
1737   chide me for it.
1738  *<S {Tro}.> You know now your hostages: your Vnckles word
1739   and my firme faith.
1740  *<S {Pan}.> Nay, Ile giue my word for her too: our kindred
1741  *though they be long ere they are wooed, they are con-stant
1742  *being wonne: they are Burres I can tell you, they'le
1743   sticke where they are throwne.
1744  *<S {Cres}.> Boldnesse comes to mee now, and brings mee
1745  *heart: Prince {Troylus}, I haue lou'd you night and day, for
1746   many weary moneths.
1747   <S {Troy}.> Why was my {Cressid} then so hard to win?
1748   <S {Cres}.> Hard to seeme won: but I was won my Lord
1749   With the first glance; that euer pardon me,
1750   If I confesse much you will play the tyrant:
1751   I loue you now, but not till now so much
1752   But I might maister it; infaith I lye:
1753   My thoughts were like vnbrideled children grow
1754   Too head- strong for their mother: see we fooles,
1755   Why haue I blab'd: who shall be true to vs
1756   When we are so vnsecret to our selues?
1757   But though I lou'd you well, I woed you not,
1758   And yet good faith I wisht my selfe a man;
1759   Or that we women had mens priuiledge
1760   Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
1761   For in this rapture I shall surely speake
1762   The thing I shall repent: see, see, your silence
1763   Comming in dumbnesse, from my weaknesse drawes
1764   My soule of counsell from me. Stop my mouth.
1765   <S {Troy}.> And shall, albeit sweete Musicke issues thence.
1766   <S {Pan}.> Pretty yfaith.
1767   <S {Cres}.> My Lord, I doe beseech you pardon me,
1768   'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kisse:
1769   I am asham'd; O Heauens, what haue I done!
1770   For this time will I take my leaue my Lord.
1771   <S {Troy}.> Your leaue sweete {Cressid}?
1772  *<S {Pan}.> Leaue: #and you take leaue till to morrow mor-ning.
1773  _
1774   <S {Cres}.> Pray you content you.
1775   <S {Troy}.> What offends you Lady?
1776   <S {Cres}.> Sir, mine owne company.
1777   <S {Troy}.> You cannot shun your selfe.
1778   <S {Cres}.> Let me goe and try:
1779   I haue a kinde of selfe recides with you:
1780   But an vnkinde   selfe, that it selfe will leaue,
1781   To be anothers foole. Where is my wit?
1782   I would be gone: I speake I know not what.
1783  *<S {Troy}.> Well know they what they speake, that speakes
1784   so wisely.
1785  *<S {Cre}.> Perchance my Lord, I shew more craft then loue,
1786   And fell so roundly to a large confession,
1787   To Angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
1788   Or else you loue not: for to be wise and loue,
1789   Exceedes mans #might, that dwels with gods aboue.
1790   <S {Troy}.> O that I thought it could be in a woman:
1791   As if it can, I will presume in you,
1792   To feede for aye her lampe and flames of loue.
1793   To keepe her constancie in plight and youth,
1794   Out- liuing beauties outward, with a minde
1795   That doth renew swifter then blood decaies:
1796   Or that perswasion could but thus conuince me,
1797   That my integritie and truth to you,
1798   Might be affronted with the match and waight
1799   Of such a winnowed puritie in loue:
1800   How were I then vp- lifted! but alas,
1801   I am as true, as truths simplicitie,
1802   And simpler then the infancie of truth.
1803   <S {Cres}.> In that Ile warre with you.
1804   <S {Troy}.> O vertuous fight,
1805   When right with right wars who shall be most right:
1806   True swaines in loue, shall in the world to come
1807   Approue their truths by {Troylus}, when their times,
1808   Full of protest, of oath and big compare;
1809   Wants similes, truth tir'd with iteration,
1810   As true as steele, as plantage to the Moone:
1811   As Sunne to day: as Turtle to her mate:
1812   As Iron to Adamant: as Earth to th 'Center:
1813   Yet after all comparisons of truth,
1814   (As truths authenticke author to be cited)
1815   As true as {Troylus}, shall crowne vp the Verse,
1816   And sanctifie the numbers.
1817   <S {Cres}.> Prophet may you be:
1818   If I be false, or swerue a haire from truth,
1819   When time is old and hath forgot it selfe:
1820   When water drops haue worne the Stones of {Troy};
1821   And blinde obliuion swallow'd Cities vp;
1822   And mightie States characterlesse are grated
1823   To dustie nothing; yet let memory,
1824   From false to false, among false Maids in loue,
1825   Vpbraid my falsehood, when they'aue said as false,
1826   As Aire, as Water, as Winde, as sandie earth;
1827   As Foxe to Lambe; as Wolfe to Heifers Calfe;
1828   Pard to the Hinde, or Stepdame to her Sonne;
1829   Yea, let them say, to sticke the heart of falsehood,
      <P YY6v>
1830   As false as {Cressid}.
1831  *<S {Pand}.> Go #too, a bargaine made: seale it, seale it, Ile
1832  *be the witnesse here I hold your hand: here my Cousins,
1833  *if euer you proue false one to another, since I haue taken
1834  *such paines to bring you together, let all pittifull goers
1835  *betweene be cal'd to the worlds end after my name: call
1836  *them all Panders; let all constant men be {Troylusses}, all
1837  *false women {Cressids}, and all brokers betweene, Panders:
1838   say, Amen.
1839   <S {Troy}.> Amen.
1840   <S {Cres}.> Amen.
1841   <S {Pan}.> Amen.
1842  *Whereupon I will shew you a Chamber, which bed, be-cause
1843  *it shall not speake of your prettie encounters, presse
1844   it to death: away.
1845   And {Cupid} grant all tong- tide Maidens heere,
1846   Bed, Chamber, and Pander, to prouide this geere.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1847   <D {Enter Vlysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Agamemnon},
1848   {Menelaus and Chalcas. Florish}.>
1849   <S {Cal}.> Now Princes for the seruice I haue done you,
1850   Th' aduantage of the time promps me aloud,
1851   To call for recompence: appeare it to your minde,
1852   That through the sight I beare in things to loue,
1853   I haue abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
1854   Incur'd a Traitors name, expos'd my selfe,
1855   From certaine and possest conueniences,
1856   To doubtfull fortunes, sequestring from me all
1857   That time, acquaintance, custome and condition,
1858   Made tame, and most familiar to my nature:
1859   And here to doe you seruice am become,
1860   As new into the world, strange, vnacquainted.
1861   I doe beseech you, as in way of taste,
1862   To giue me now a little benefit:
1863   Out of those many registred in promise,
1864   Which you say, liue to come in my behalfe.
1865  *<S {Agam}.> What would'st thou of vs Troian? make
1866   demand?
1867   <S {Cal}.> You haue a Troian prisoner, cal'd {Anthenor},
1868   Yesterday tooke: Troy holds him very deere.
1869   Oft haue you (often haue you, thankes therefore)
1870   Desir'd my {Cressid} in right great exchange.
1871   Whom Troy hath still deni'd: but this {Anthenor},
1872   I know is such a wrest in their affaires;
1873   That their negotiations all must slacke,
1874   Wanting his mannage: and they will almost,
1875   Giue vs a Prince of blood, a Sonne of {Priam},
1876   In change of him. Let him be sent great Princes,
1877   And he shall buy my Daughter: and her presence,
1878   Shall quite strike off all seruice I haue done,
1879   In most accepted paine.
1880   <S {Aga}.> Let {Diomedes} beare him,
1881   And bring vs {Cressid} hither: {Calcas} shall haue
1882   What he requests of vs: good {Diomed}
1883   Furnish you fairely for this enterchange;
1884   Withall bring word, if {Hector} will to morrow
1885   Be answer'd in his challenge. {Aiax} is ready.
1886   <S {Dio}.> This shall I vndertake, and 'tis a burthen
1887   Which I am proud to beare. <D {Exit}.>
1888   <D {Enter} Achilles {and} Patroclus {in their Tent}.>
1889   <S {Vlis}.> {Achilles} stands i'th entrance of his Tent;
1890   Please it our Generall to passe strangely by him,
1891   As if he were forgot: and Princes all,
1892   Lay negligent and loose regard vpon him;
1893   I will come last, 'tis like heele question me,
1894  *Why such vnplausiue eyes are bent? why turn'd on him?
1895   If so, I haue derision medicinable,
1896   To vse betweene your strangenesse and his pride,
1897   Which his owne #will shall haue desire to drinke;
1898   It may doe good, pride hath no other glasse
1899   To show it selfe, but pride: for supple knees,
1900   Feede arrogance, and are the proud mans fees.
1901   <S {Agam}.> Weele execute your purpose, and put on
1902   A forme of strangenesse as we passe along,
1903   So doe each Lord, and either greete him not,
1904   Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more,
1905   Then if not lookt on. I will lead the way.
1906  *<S {Achil}.> What comes the Generall to speake with me?
1907   You know my minde, Ile fight no more 'gainst Troy.
1908   <S {Aga}.> What saies {Achilles}, would he ought with vs?
1909  *<S {Nes}.> Would you my Lord ought with the Generall?
1910   <S {Achil}.> No.
1911   <S {Nes}.> Nothing my Lord.
1912   <S {Aga}.> The better.
1913   <S {Achil}.> Good day, good day.
1914   <S {Men}.> How doe you? how doe you?
1915   <S {Achi}.> What, do's the Cuckold scorne me?
1916   <S {Aiax}.> How now {Patroclus}?
1917   <S {Achil}.> Good morrow {Aiax}?
1918   <S {Aiax}.> Ha.
1919   <S {Achil}.> Good morrow.
1920   <S {Aiax}.> #I, and good next day too.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1921  *<S {Achil}.> What meane these fellowes? know they not
1922   {Achilles}?
1923  *<S {Patr}.> They passe by strangely: they were vs'd to bend
1924   To send their smiles before them to {Achilles}:
1925  *To come as humbly as they vs'd to creepe to holy Altars.
1926   <S {Achil}.> What am I poore of late?
1927   'Tis certaine, greatnesse once falne out with fortune,
1928   Must fall out with men too: what the declin'd is,
1929   He shall as soone reade in the eyes of others,
1930   As feele in his owne fall: for men like butter- flies,
1931   Shew not their mealie wings, but to the Summer:
1932   And not a man for being simply man,
1933   Hath any honour; but honour'd for those honours
1934   That are without him; as place, riches, and fauour,
1935   Prizes of accident, as oft as merit:
1936   Which when they fall, as being slippery standers;
1937   The loue that leand on them as slippery too,
1938   Doth one plucke downe another, and together
1939   Dye in the fall. But 'tis not so with me;
1940   Fortune and I are friends, I doe enioy
1941   At ample point, all that I did possesse,
1942   Saue these mens lookes: who do me thinkes finde out
1943   Something not worth in me such rich beholding,
1944   As they haue often giuen. Here is {Vlisses},
1945   Ile interrupt his reading: how now {Vlisses}?
1946   <S {Vlis}.> Now great {Thetis} Sonne.
1947   <S {Achil}.> What are you reading?
1948   <S {Vlis}.> A strange fellow here
1949   Writes me, that man, how dearely euer parted,
1950   How much in hauing, or without, or in,
1951   Cannot make boast to haue that which he hath;
1952   Nor feeles not what he owes, but by reflection:
1953   As when his vertues shining vpon others,
1954   Heate them, and they retort that heate againe
1955   To the first giuer.
1956   <S {Achil}.> This is not strange {Vlisses}:
1957   The beautie that is borne here in the face,
1958   The bearer knowes not, but commends it selfe,
1959   Not going from it selfe: but eye to eye oppos'd,
      <P YYY1>
1960   Salutes each other with each others forme.
1961   For speculation turnes not to it selfe,
1962   Till it hath trauail'd, and is married there
1963   Where it may see it selfe: this is not strange at all.
1964   <S {Vlis}.> I doe not straine it at the position,
1965   It is familiar; but at the Authors drift,
1966   Who in his circumstance, expresly proues
1967   That no man is the Lord of any thing,
1968   (Though in and of him there is much consisting,)
1969   Till he communicate his parts to others:
1970   Nor doth he of himselfe know them for ought,
1971   Till he behold them formed in th 'applause,
1972  *Where they are extended: who like an arch reuerb'rate
1973   The voyce againe; or like a gate of steele,
1974   Fronting the Sunne, receiues and renders backe
1975   His figure, and his heate. I was much rapt in this,
1976   And apprehended here immediately:
1977   The vnknowne {Aiax};
1978   Heauens what a man is there? a very Horse,
1979  *That has he knowes not what. Nature, what things there |(are.
1980   Most abiect in regard, and deare in vse.
1981   What things againe most deere in the esteeme,
1982   And poore in worth: now shall we see to morrow,
1983   An act that very chance doth throw vpon him?
1984   {#Aiax} renown'd? O heauens, what some men doe,
1985   While some men leaue to doe!
1986   How some men creepe in skittish fortunes hall,
1987   Whiles others play the Ideots in her eyes:
1988   How one man eates into anothers pride,
1989   While pride is feasting in his wantonnesse
1990   To see these Grecian Lords; why, euen already,
1991   They clap the lubber {Aiax} on the shoulder,
1992   As if his foote were on braue {Hectors} brest,
1993   And great {Troy} shrinking.
1994   <S {Achil}.> I doe beleeue it:
1995   For they past by me, as mysers doe by beggars,
1996   Neither gaue to me good word, nor looke:
1997   What are my deedes forgot?
1998   <S {Vlis}.> Time hath (my Lord) a wallet at his backe,
1999   Wherein he puts almes for obliuion:
2000   A great siz'd monster of ingratitudes:
2001   Those scraps are good deedes past,
2002   Which are deuour'd as fast as they are made,
2003   Forgot as soone as done: perseuerance, deere my Lord,
2004   Keepes honor bright, to haue done, is to hang
2005   Quite out of fashion, like a rustie male,
2006   In monumentall mockrie: take the instant way,
2007   For honour trauels in a straight so narrow,
2008   Where one but goes #a breast, keepe then the paths
2009   For emulation hath a thousand Sonnes,
2010   That one by one pursue; if you giue way,
2011   Or hedge aside from the direct forth right;
2012   Like to an entred Tyde, they all rush by,
2013   And leaue you hindmost:
2014   Or like gallant Horse falne in first ranke,
2015   Lye there for pauement to the abiect, neere
2016  *Ore- run and trampled on: then what they doe in present,
2017   Though lesse then yours in past, must ore- top yours:
2018   For time is like a fashionable Hoste,
2019   That slightly shakes his parting Guest by th' hand;
2020   And with his armes out- stretcht, as he would flye,
2021   Graspes in the commer: the welcome euer smiles,
2022   And farewels goes out sighing: O let not vertue seeke
2023   Remuneration for the thing it was: for beautie, wit,
2024   High birth, vigor of bone, desert in seruice,
2025   Loue, friendship, charity, are subiects all
      <C U>
2026   To enuious and calumniating time:
2027   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin:
2028   That all with one consent praise new borne gaudes,
2029   Though they are made and moulded of things past,
2030   And goe to dust, that is a little guilt,
2031   More laud then guilt oredusted.
2032   The present eye praises the present obiect:
2033   Then maruell not thou great and compleat man,
2034   That all the Greekes begin to worship {Aiax};
2035   Since things in motion begin to catch the eye,
2036   Then what not stirs: the cry went out on thee,
2037   And still it might, and yet it may againe,
2038   If thou would'st not entombe thy selfe aliue,
2039   And case thy reputation in thy Tent;
2040   Whose glorious deedes, but in these fields of late,
2041   Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselues,
2042   And draue great {Mars} to faction.
2043   <S {Achil}.> Of this my priuacie,
2044   I haue strong reasons.
2045   <S {Vlis}.> But 'gainst your priuacie
2046   The reasons are more potent and heroycall:
2047   'Tis knowne {Achilles}, that you are in loue
2048   With one of {Priams} daughters.
2049   <S {Achil}.> Ha? knowne?
2050   <S {Vlis}.> Is that a wonder?
2051   The prouidence that's in a watchfull State,
2052   Knowes almost euery graine of Plutoes gold;
2053   Findes bottome in th' vncomprehensiue deepes;
2054   Keepes place with thought; and almost like the gods,
2055   Doe thoughts vnuaile in their dumbe cradles:
2056   There is a mysterie (with whom relation
2057   durst neuer meddle) in the soule of State;
2058   Which hath an operation more diuine,
2059   Then breath or pen can giue expressure to:
2060   All the commerse that you haue had with Troy,
2061   As perfectly is ours, as yours, my Lord.
2062   And better would it fit {Achilles} much,
2063   To throw downe {Hector} then {Polixena}.
2064   But it must grieue yong {Pirhus} now at home,
2065   When fame shall in her Iland sound her trumpe;
2066   And all the Greekish Girles shall tripping sing,
2067   Great {Hectors} sister did {Achilles} winne;
2068   But our great {Aiax} brauely beate downe him.
2069   Farewell my Lord: I as your louer speake;
2070   The foole slides ore the Ice that you should breake.
2071   <S {Patr}.> To this effect {Achilles} haue I mou'd you;
2072   A woman impudent and mannish growne,
2073   Is not more loth'd, then an effeminate man,
2074   In time of action: I stand condemn'd for this;
2075   They thinke my little stomacke to the warre,
2076   And your great loue to me, restraines you thus:
2077   Sweete, rouse your selfe; and the weake wanton {Cupid}
2078   Shall from your necke vnloose his amorous fould,
2079   And like a dew drop from the Lyons mane,
2080   Be shooke to ayrie ayre.
2081   <S {Achil}.> Shall {Aiax} fight with {Hector}?
2082   <S {Patr}.> #I, and perhaps receiue much honor by him.
2083   <S {Achil}.> I see my reputation is at stake,
2084   My fame is shrowdly gored.
2085   <S {Patr}.> O then beware:
2086   Those wounds heale #ill, that men doe giue themselues:
2087   Omission to doe what is necessary,
2088   Seales a commission to a blanke of danger,
2089   And danger like an ague subtly taints
2090   Euen then when we sit idely in the sunne.
2091   <S {Achil}.> Goe call {Thersites} hither sweet {Patroclus},
      <P YYY1v><C J>
2092   Ile send the foole to {Aiax}, and desire him
2093   T' inuite the Troian Lords after the Combat
2094   To see vs here vnarm'd: I haue a womans longing,
2095   An appetite that I am sicke withall,
2096  *To see great {Hector} in his weedes of peace;  <D {Enter Thersi}.>
2097   To talke with him, and to behold his visage,
2098   Euen to my full of view. A labour sau'd.
2099   <S {Ther}.> A wonder.
2100   <S {Achil}.> What?
2101  *<S {Ther}.> {Aiax} goes vp and downe the field, asking for
2102   himselfe.
2103   <S {Achil}.> How so?
2104  *<S {Ther}.> Hee must fight singly to morrow with {Hector},
2105  *and is so prophetically proud of an heroicall cudgelling,
2106   that he raues in saying nothing.
2107   <S {Achil}.> How can that be?
2108  *<S {Ther}.> Why he stalkes vp and downe like a Peacock, a
2109  *stride and a stand: ruminates like an hostesse, that hath no
2110  *Arithmatique but her braine to set downe her recko-ning:
2111  *bites his lip with a politique regard, as who should
2112  *say, there were wit in his head and twoo'd out; and so
2113  *there is: but it lyes as coldly in him, as fire in a flint,
2114  *which will not shew without knocking. The mans vn-done
2115  *for euer; for if {Hector} breake not his necke i'th' com-bat,
2116  *heele break't himselfe in vaine- glory. He knowes
2117  *not mee: I said, good morrow {Aiax}; And he replyes,
2118  *thankes {Agamemnon}. What thinke you of this man,
2119  *that takes me for the Generall? Hee's growne a very
2120  *land- fish, languagelesse, a monster: a plague of o-pinion,
2121  *a man may weare it on both sides like a leather
2122   Ierkin.
2123  *<S {Achil}.> Thou must be my Ambassador to him {Thersites}.
2124  *<S {Ther}.> Who, I: why, heele answer no body: he pro-fesses
2125  *not#answering; speaking is for beggers: he weares
2126  *his tongue in's armes: I will put on his presence; let {Pa-troclus}
2127  *make his demands to me, you shall see the Page-ant
2128   of {Aiax}.
2129  *<S {Achil}.> To him {Patroclus}; tell him, I humbly desire the
2130  *valiant {Aiax}, to inuite the most valorous {Hector}, to come
2131  *vnarm'd to my Tent, and to procure safe conduct for his
2132  *person, of the magnanimious and most illustrious, sixe or
2133  *seauen times honour'd Captaine, Generall of the Grecian
2134   Armie {Agamemnon}, &c. doe this.
2135   <S {Patro}.> {Ioue} blesse great {Aiax}.
2136   <S {Ther}.> Hum.
2137   <S {Patr}.> I come from the worthy {Achilles}.
2138   <S {Ther}.> Ha?
2139  *<S {Patr}.> Who most humbly desires you to inuite {Hector}
2140   to his Tent.
2141   <S {Ther}.> Hum.
2142   <S {Patr}.> And to procure safe conduct from {Agamemnon}.
2143   <S {Ther}.> {Agamemnon}?
2144   <S {Patr}.> #I my Lord.
2145   <S {Ther}.> Ha?
2146   <S {Patr}.> What say you too't.
2147   <S {Ther}.> God buy you with all my heart.
2148   <S {Patr}.> Your answer sir.
2149  *<S {Ther}.> If to morrow be a faire day, by eleuen #a clocke
2150  *it will goe one way or other; howsoeuer, he shall pay for
2151   me ere he has me.
2152   <S {Patr}.> Your answer sir.
2153   <S {Ther}.> Fare you well with#all my heart.
2154   <S {Achil}.> Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
2155  *<S {Ther}.> No, but he's out #a tune thus: what musicke will
2156  *be in him when {Hector} has knockt out his braines, I know
2157  *not: but I am sure none, vnlesse the Fidler {Apollo} get his
2158   sinewes to make catlings on.
2159  *<S {Achil}.> Come, thou shalt beare a Letter to him
2160   straight.
2161  *<S {Ther}.> Let me carry another to his Horse; for that's the
2162   more capable creature.
2163   <S {Achil}.> My minde is troubled like a Fountaine stir'd,
2164   And I my selfe see not the bottome of it.
2165  *<S {Ther}.> Would the Fountaine of your minde were cleere
2166  *againe, that I might water an Asse at it: I had rather be a
2167   Ticke in  a Sheepe, then such a valiant ignorance.
2168   <D {Enter at one doore Aeneas with a Torch, at another}
2169   {#Paris, Diephoebus, Anthenor, Diomed the}
2170   {Grecian, with Torches}.>
2171   <S {Par}.> See hoa, who is that there?
2172   <S {Dieph}.> It is the Lord {Aeneas}.
2173   <S {Aene}.> Is the Prince there in person?
2174   Had I so good occasion to lye long
2175   As you Prince {Paris}, nothing but heauenly businesse,
2176   Should rob my bed- mate of my company.
2177  *<S {Diom}.> That's my minde too: good morrow Lord
2178   {Aeneas}.
2179   <S {Par}.> A valiant Greeke {Aeneas}, take his hand,
2180   Witnesse the processe of your speech within;
2181   You told how {Diomed}, in a whole weeke by dayes
2182   Did haunt you in the Field.
2183   <S {Aene}.> Health to you valiant sir,
2184   During all question of the gentle truce:
2185   But when I meete you arm'd, as blacke defiance,
2186   As heart can thinke, or courage execute.
2187   <S {Diom}.> The one and other {Diomed} embraces,
2188   Our blouds are now in calme; and so long health:
2189   But when contention, and occasion meetes,
2190   By {Ioue}, Ile play the hunter for thy life,
2191   With all my force, pursuite and pollicy.
2192   <S {Aene}.> And thou shalt hunt a Lyon that will flye
2193   With his face backward, in humaine gentlenesse:
2194   Welcome to Troy; now by {Anchises} life,
2195   Welcome indeede: by {Venus} hand I sweare,
2196   No man aliue can loue in such a sort,
2197   The thing he meanes to kill, more excellently.
2198   <S {Diom}.> We simpathize. {Ioue} let {Aeneas} liue
2199   (If to my sword his fate be not the glory)
2200   A thousand compleate courses of the Sunne,
2201   But in mine emulous honor let him dye:
2202   With euery ioynt a wound, and that to morrow.
2203   <S {Aene}.> We know each other well.
2204   <S {Dio}.> We doe, and long to know each other worse.
2205   <S {Par}.> This is the most, despightful'st gentle greeting;
2206   The noblest hatefull loue, that ere I heard of.
2207   What businesse Lord so early?
2208  *<S {Aene}.> I was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.
2209  *<S {Par}.> His purpose meets you; it was to bring this Greek
2210   To {Calcha's} house; and there to render him,
2211   For the enfreed {Anthenor}, the faire {Cressid}:
2212   Lets haue your company; or if you please,
2213   Haste there before vs. I constantly doe thinke,
2214   (Or rather call my thought a certaine knowledge)
2215   My brother {Troylus} lodges there to night.
2216   Rouse him, and giue him note of our approach,
2217   With the whole quality whereof, I feare
2218   We shall be much vnwelcome.
2219   <S {Aene}.> That I assure you:
2220   {#Troylus} had rather Troy were borne to Greece,
2221   Then {Cressid} borne from Troy.
      <P YYY2>
2222   <S {Par}.> There is no helpe:
2223   The bitter disposition of the time will haue it so.
2224   On Lord, weele follow you.
2225   <S {Aene}.> Good morrow all.  <D {Exit Aeneas}>
2226   <S {Par}.> And tell me noble {Diomed}: faith tell me true,
2227   Euen in the soule of sound good fellowship,
2228   Who in your thoughts merits faire {Helen} most?
2229   My selfe, or {Menelaus}?
2230   <S {Diom}.> Both alike.
2231   He merits well to haue her, that doth seeke her,
2232   Not making any scruple of her soylure,
2233   With such a #hell of paine, and world of charge.
2234   And you as well to keepe her, that defend her,
2235   Not pallating the taste of her dishonour,
2236   With such a costly losse of wealth and friends:
2237   He like a puling Cuckold, would drinke vp
2238   The lees and dregs of a flat tamed peece:
2239   You like a letcher, out of whorish loynes,
2240   Are pleas'd to breede out your inheritors:
2241   Both merits poyz'd, each weighs no lesse nor more,
2242   But he as he, which heauier for a whore.
2243   <S {Par}.> You are too bitter to your country- woman.
2244   <S {Dio}.> Shee's bitter to her countrey: heare me {Paris},
2245   For euery false drop in her baudy veines,
2246   A Grecians life hath sunke: for euery scruple
2247   Of her contaminated carrion weight,
2248   A Troian hath beene slaine. Since she could speake,
2249   She hath not giuen so many good words breath,
2250   As for her, Greekes and Troians suffred death.
2251   <S {Par}.> Faire {Diomed}, you doe as chapmen doe,
2252   Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
2253   But we in silence hold this vertue well;
2254   Weele not commend, what we intend to sell.
2255   Here lyes our way.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2256   <D {Enter Troylus and Cressida}.>
2257  *<S {Troy}.> Deere trouble not your selfe: the morne is cold.
2258  *<S {Cres}.> Then sweet my Lord, Ile call mine Vnckle down;
2259   He shall vnbolt the Gates.
2260   <S {Troy}.> Trouble him not:
2261   To bed, to bed: sleepe kill those pritty eyes,
2262   And giue as soft attachment to thy sences,
2263   As Infants empty of all thought.
2264   <S {Cres}.> Good morrow then.
2265   <S {Troy}.> I prithee now to bed.
2266   <S {Cres}.> Are you #a weary of me?
2267   <S {Troy}.> O {Cressida}! but that the busie day
2268   Wak't by the Larke, hath rouz'd the ribauld Crowes,
2269   And dreaming night will hide our eyes no longer:
2270   I would not from thee.
2271   <S {Cres}.> Night hath beene too briefe.
2272  *<S {Troy}.> Beshrew the witch! with venemous wights she |(stayes,
2273   As hidiously as #hell; but flies the graspes of loue,
2274   With wings more momentary, swift then thought:
2275   You will catch cold, and curse me.
2276   <S {Cres}.> Prithee tarry, you men will neuer tarry;
2277   O foolish {Cressid}, I might haue still held off,
2278   And then you would haue tarried. Harke, ther's one vp?
2279   <S {Pand}. {within}.> What's all the doores open here?
2280   <S {Troy}.> It is your Vnckle.  <D {Enter Pandarus}.>
2281   <S {Cres}.> A pestilence on him: now will he be mocking:
2282   I shall haue such a life.
2283   <S {Pan}.> How now, how now? how goe maiden- heads?
2284   Heare you Maide: wher's my cozin {Cressid}?
2285  *<S {Cres}.> Go hang your self, you naughty mocking Vnckle:
2286   You bring me to doo === and then you floute me too.
2287   <S {Pan}.> To do what? to do what? let her say what:
2288   What haue I brought you to doe?
2289  *<S {Cres}.> Come, come, beshrew your heart: youle nere be
2290   good, nor suffer others.
2291  *<S {Pan}.> Ha, ha: alas poore wretch: a poore {Chipochia}, hast
2292  *not slept to night? would he not (a naughty man) let it
2293   sleepe: a bug- beare take him.  <D {One knocks}.>
2294  *<S {Cres}.> Did not I tell you? would he were knockt ith'
2295   head. Who's that at doore? good Vnckle goe and see.
2296   My Lord, come you againe into my Chamber:
2297   You smile and mocke me, as if I meant naughtily.
2298   <S {Troy}.> Ha, ha.
2299  *<S {Cre}.> Come you are deceiu'd, I thinke of no such thing.
2300   How earnestly they knocke: pray you come in.  <D {Knocke}.>
2301   I would not for halfe {Troy} haue you seene here.  <D {Exeunt}>
2302  *<S {Pan}.> Who's there? what's the matter? will you beate
2303   downe the doore? How now, what's the matter?
2304   <S {Aene}.> Good morrow Lord, good morrow.
2305  *<S {Pan}.> Who's there my Lord {Aeneas}? by my troth I
2306   knew you not: what newes with you so early?
2307   <S {Aene}.> Is not Prince {Troylus} here?
2308   <S {Pan}.> Here? what should he doe here?
2309  *<S {Aene}.> Come he is here, my Lord, doe not deny him:
2310   It doth import him much to speake with me.
2311  *<S {Pan}.> Is he here say you? 'tis more then I know, Ile be
2312  *sworne: For my owne part I came in late: what should
2313   he doe here?
2314  *<S {Aene}.> Who, nay then: Come, come, youle doe him
2315  *wrong, ere y'are ware: youle be so true to him, to be
2316  *false to him: Doe not you know of him, but yet goe fetch
2317   him hither, goe.
2318   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
2319   <S {Troy}.> How now, what's the matter?
2320   <S {Aene}.> My Lord, I scarce haue leisure to salute you,
2321   My matter is so rash: there is at hand,
2322   {Paris} your brother, and {Deiphoebus},
2323   The Grecian {Diomed}, and our {Anthenor}
2324   Deliuer'd to vs, and for him forth- with,
2325   Ere the first sacrifice, within this houre,
2326   We must giue vp to {Diomeds} hand
2327   The Lady {Cressida}.
2328   <S {Troy}.> Is it concluded so?
2329   <S {Aene}.> By {Priam}, and the generall state of {Troy},
2330   They are at hand, and ready to effect it.
2331   <S {Troy}.> How my atchieuements mocke me;
2332   I will goe meete them: and my Lord {Aeneas},
2333   We met by chance; you did not finde me here.
2334   <S {Aen}.> Good, good, my Lord, the secrets of nature
2335   Haue not more gift in taciturnitie.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2336   <D {Enter Pandarus and Cressid}.>
2337  *<S {Pan}.> Is't possible? no sooner got but lost: the diuell
2338  *take {Anthenor}; the yong Prince will goe mad: a plague
2339   vpon {Anthenor}; I would they had brok's necke.
2340   <S {Cres}.> How now? what's the matter? who was here?
2341   <S {Pan}.> Ah, ha!
2342  *<S {Cres}.> Why sigh you so profoundly? wher's my Lord?
2343   gone? tell me sweet Vnckle, what's the matter?
2344  *<S {Pan}.> Would I were as deepe vnder the earth as I am
2345   aboue.
2346   <S {Cres}.> O the gods! what's the matter?
2347  *<S {Pan}.> Prythee get thee in: would thou had'st nere been
2348  *borne; I knew thou would'st be his death. O poore Gen-tleman:
2349   a plague vpon {Anthenor}.
      <P YYY2v>
2350  *<S {Cres}.> Good Vnckle I beseech you, on my knees, I be-seech
2351   you what's the matter?
2352  *<S {Pan}.> Thou must be gone wench, thou must be gone;
2353  *thou art chang'd for {Anthenor}: thou must to thy Father,
2354  *and be gone from {Troylus}: 'twill be his death: 'twill be
2355   his baine, he cannot beare it.
2356   <S {Cres}.> O you immortall gods! I will not goe.
2357   <S {Pan}.> Thou must.
2358   <S {Cres}.> I will not Vnckle: I haue forgot my Father:
2359   I know no touch of consanguinitie:
2360   No kin, no loue, no bloud, no soule, so neere me,
2361   As the sweet {Troylus}: O you gods diuine!
2362   Make {Cressids} name the very crowne of falshood!
2363   If euer she leaue {Troylus}: time, force and death,
2364   Do to this body what extremitie you can;
2365   But the strong base and building of my loue,
2366   Is as the very Center of the earth,
2367   Drawing all things to it. I will goe in and weepe.
2368   <S {Pan}.> Doe, doe.
2369   <S {Cres}.> Teare my bright heire, and scratch my praised
2370   cheekes,
2371   Cracke my cleere voyce with sobs, and breake my heart
2372  *With sounding {Troylus}. I will not goe from {Troy}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2373   <D {Enter Paris, Troylus, Aeneas, Deiphebus, An-thenor}
2374   {and Diomedes}.>
2375   <S {Par}.> It is great morning, and the houre prefixt
2376   Of her deliuerie to this valiant Greeke
2377   Comes fast vpon: good my brother {Troylus},
2378   Tell you the Lady what she is to doe,
2379   And #hast her to the purpose.
2380   <S {Troy}.> Walke into her house.
2381   Ile bring her to the Grecian presently;
2382   And to his hand, when I deliuer her,
2383   Thinke it an Altar, and thy brother {Troylus}
2384   A Priest, there offring to it his heart.
2385   <S {Par}.> I know what 'tis to loue,
2386   And would, as I shall pittie, I could helpe.
2387   Please you walke in, my Lords.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2388   <D {Enter Pandarus and Cressid}.>
2389   <S {Pan}.> Be moderate, be moderate.
2390   <S {Cres}.> Why tell you me of moderation?
2391   The griefe is fine, full perfect that I taste,
2392   And no lesse in a sense as strong
2393   As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?
2394   If I could temporise with my affection,
2395   Or brew it to a weake and colder pallat,
2396   The like alaiment could I giue my griefe:
2397   My loue admits no qualifying crosse;  <D {Enter Troylus}.>
2398   No more my griefe, in such a precious losse.
2399   <S {Pan}.> Here, here, here, he comes, #a sweet ducke.
2400   <S {Cres}.> O {Troylus}, {Troylus}!
2401  *<S {Pan}.> What a paire of spectacles is here? let me em-brace
2402  *too: oh hart, as the goodly saying is; O heart, hea-uie
2403  *heart, why sighest thou without breaking? where he
2404  *answers againe; because thou canst not ease thy smart by
2405  *friendship, not by speaking: there was neuer a truer rime;
2406  *let vs cast away nothing, for we may liue to haue neede
2407   of such a Verse: we see it, we see it: how now Lambs?
2408   <S {Troy}.> {Cressid}: I loue thee in so strange a puritie;
2409   That the blest gods, as angry with my fancie,
2410   More bright in zeale, then the deuotion which
2411   Cold lips blow to their Deities: take thee from me.
2412   <S {Cres}.> Haue the gods enuie?
2413   <S {Pan}.> #I, #I, #I, #I, 'tis too plaine a case.
2414   <S {Cres}.> And is it true, that I must goe from Troy?
2415   <S {Troy}.> A hatefull truth.
2416   <S {Cres}.> What, and from {Troylus} too?
2417   <S {Troy}.> From Troy, and {Troylus}.
2418   <S {Cres}.> Ist possible?
2419   <S {Troy}.> And sodainely, where iniurie of chance
2420   Puts backe leaue- taking, iustles roughly by
2421   All time of pause; rudely beguiles our lips
2422   Of all reioyndure: forcibly preuents
2423   Our lockt embrasures; strangles our deare vowes,
2424   Euen in the birth of our owne laboring breath.
2425   We two, that with so many thousand sighes
2426   Did buy each other, must poorely sell our selues,
2427   With the rude breuitie and discharge of our
2428   Iniurious time; now with a robbers haste
2429   Crams his rich theeuerie vp, he knowes not how.
2430   As many farwels as be stars in heauen,
2431   With distinct breath, and consign'd kisses to them,
2432   He fumbles vp into a loose adiew;
2433   And scants vs with a single famisht kisse,
2434   Distasting with the salt of broken teares.  <D {Enter Aeneas}.>
2435   <S {Aeneas} {within}.> My Lord, is the Lady ready?
2436   <S {Troy}.> Harke, you are call'd: some say the genius so
2437   Cries, come to him that instantly must dye.
2438   Bid them haue patience: she shall come anon.
2439  *<S {Pan}.> Where are my teares? raine, to lay this winde,
2440   Or my heart will be blowne vp by the root.
2441   <S {Cres}.>  I must then to the Grecians?
2442   <S {Troy}.> No remedy.
2443   <S {Cres}.> A wofull {Cressid} 'mong'st the merry Greekes.
2444   <S {Troy}.> When shall we see againe?
2445   <S {Troy}.> #Here me my loue: be thou but true of heart.
2446   <S {Cres}.> I true? how now? what wicked deeme is this?
2447   <S {Troy}.> Nay, we must vse expostulation kindely,
2448   For it is parting from vs:
2449   I speake not, be thou true, as fearing thee:
2450   For I will throw my Gloue to death himselfe,
2451   That there's no maculation in thy heart:
2452   But be thou true, say I, to fashion in
2453   My sequent protestation: be thou true,
2454   And I will see thee.
2455   <S {Cres}.> O you shall be expos'd, my Lord to dangers
2456   As infinite, as imminent: but Ile be true.
2457   <S {Troy}.> And Ile grow friend with danger;
2458   Weare this Sleeue.
2459   <S {Cres}.> And you this Gloue.
2460   When shall I see you?
2461   <S {Troy}.> I will corrupt the Grecian Centinels,
2462   To giue thee nightly visitation.
2463   But yet be true.
2464   <S {Cres}.> O heauens: be true againe?
2465   <S {Troy}.> Heare why I speake it; Loue:
2466   The Grecian youths are full of qualitie,
2467   Their louing well compos'd, with guift of nature,
2468   Flawing and swelling ore with Arts and exercise:
2469   How nouelties may moue, and parts with person.
2470   Alas, a kinde of godly iealousie;
2471   Which I beseech you call a vertuous sinne:
2472   Makes me affraid.
2473   <S {Cres}.> O heauens, you loue me not!
2474   <S {Troy}.> Dye I a villaine then:
2475   In this I doe not call your faith in question
2476   So mainely as my merit: I cannot sing,
2477   Nor #heele the high Lauolt; nor sweeten talke;
2478   Nor play at subtill games; faire vertues all;
      <P YYY3>
2479   To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
2480   But I can tell that in each grace of these,
2481   There lurkes a still and dumb- discoursiue diuell,
2482   That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
2483   <S {Cres}.> Doe you thinke I will:
2484  *<S {Troy}.> No, but something may be done that we wil not:
2485   And sometimes we are diuels to our selues,
2486   When we will tempt the frailtie of our powers,
2487   Presuming on their changefull potencie.
2488   <S {Aeneas} {within}.> Nay, good my Lord?
2489   <S {Troy}.> Come kisse, and let vs part.
2490   <S {Paris} {within}.> Brother {Troylus}?
2491   <S {Troy}.> Good brother come you hither,
2492   And bring {Aeneas} and the Grecian with you.
2493   <S {Cres}.> My Lord, will you be true?  <D {Exit}.>
2494   <S {Troy}.> Who I? alas it is my vice, my fault:
2495   Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
2496   I, with great truth, catch meere simplicitie;
2497   Whil'st some with cunning guild their copper crownes,
2498   With truth and plainnesse I doe weare mine bare:
2499   <D {Enter the Greekes}.>
2500   Feare not my truth; the morrall of my wit
2501   Is plaine and true, ther's all the reach of it.
2502   Welcome sir {Diomed}, here is the Lady
2503   Which for {Antenor}, we deliuer you.
2504   At the port (Lord) Ile giue her to thy hand,
2505   And by the way possesse thee what she is.
2506   Entreate her faire; and by my soule, faire Greeke,
2507   If ere thou stand at mercy of my Sword,
2508   Name {Cressid}, and thy life shall be as safe
2509   As {Priam} is in Illion?
2510   <S {Diom}.> Faire Lady {Cressid},
2511   So please you saue the thankes this Prince expects:
2512   The lustre in your eye, heauen in your cheeke,
2513   Pleades your faire visage, and to {Diomed}
2514   You shall be mistresse, and command him wholly.
2515   <S {Troy}.> Grecian, thou do'st not vse me curteously,
2516   To shame the seale of my petition towards,
2517   I praising her. I tell thee Lord of Greece:
2518   Shee is as farre high soaring o're thy praises,
2519   As thou vnworthy to be cal'd her seruant:
2520   I charge thee vse her well, euen for my charge:
2521   For by the dreadfull {Pluto}, if thou do'st not,
2522   (Though the great bulke {Achilles} be thy guard)
2523   Ile cut thy throate.
2524   <S {Diom}.> Oh be not mou'd Prince {Troylus};
2525   Let me be priuiledg'd by my place and message,
2526   To be a speaker free? when I am hence,
2527   Ile answer to my lust: and know my Lord;
2528   Ile nothing doe on charge: to her owne worth
2529   She shall be priz'd: but that you say, be't so;
2530   Ile speake it in my spirit and honor, no.
2531   <S {Troy}.> Come to the Port. Ile tell thee {Diomed},
2532   This braue, shall oft make thee to hide thy head:
2533   Lady, giue me your hand, and as we walke,
2534   To our owne selues bend we our needefull talke.
2535   <D {Sound Trumpet}.>
2536   <S {Par}.> Harke, {Hectors} Trumpet.
2537   <S {Aene}.> How haue we spent this morning
2538   The Prince must thinke me tardy and remisse,
2539   That swore to ride before him in the field.
2540  *<S {Par}.> 'Tis {Troylus} fault: come, come, to field with him.
2541   <D {Exeunt}.>
2542   <S {Dio}.> Let vs make ready straight.
2543   <S {Aene}.> Yea, with a Bridegroomes fresh alacritie
2544   Let vs addresse to tend on {Hectors} heeles:
2545   The glory of our {Troy} doth this day lye
2546   On his faire worth, and single Chiualrie.
2547   <D {Enter Aiax armed, Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon},
2548   {Menelaus, Vlisses, Nester, Calcas, &c}.>
2549   <S {Aga}.> Here art thou in appointment fresh and faire,
2550   Anticipating time. With starring courage,
2551   Giue with thy Trumpet a loud note to Troy
2552   Thou dreadfull {Aiax}, that the appauled aire
2553   May pierce the head of the great Combatant,
2554   And hale him hither.
2555   <S {Aia}.> Thou, Trumpet, ther's my purse;
2556   Now cracke thy lungs, and split thy brasen pipe:
2557   Blow villaine, till thy sphered Bias cheeke
2558   Out- swell the collicke of puft {Aquilon}:
2559   Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout bloud:
2560   Thou blowest for {Hector}.
2561   <S {Vlis}.> No Trumpet answers.
2562   <S {Achil}.> 'Tis but early dayes.
2563   <S {Aga}.> Is not yong {Diomed} with {Calcas} daughter?
2564   <S {Vlis}.> 'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gate,
2565   He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
2566   In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
2567   <S {Aga}.> Is this the Lady {Cressid}?
2568   <S {Dio}.> Euen she.
2569  *<S {Aga}.> Most deerely welcome to the Greekes, sweete
2570   Lady.
2571   <S {Nest}.> Our Generall doth salute you with a kisse.
2572  *<S {Vlis}.> Yet is the kindenesse but particular; 'twere bet-ter
2573   she were kist in generall.
2574  *<S {Nest}.> And very courtly counsell: Ile begin. So much
2575   for {Nestor}.
2576  *<S {Achil}.> Ile take that winter from your lips faire Lady
2577   {Achilles} bids you welcome.
2578   <S {Mene}.> I had good argument for kissing once.
2579   <S {Patro}.> But that's no argument for kissing now;
2580   For thus pop't {Paris} in his hardiment.
2581   <S {Vlis}.> Oh deadly gall, and theame of all our scornes,
2582   For which we loose our heads, to gild his hornes.
2583   <S {Patro}.> The first was {Menelaus} kisse, this mine:
2584   {Patroclus} kisses you.
2585   <S {Mene}.> Oh this is trim.
2586   <S {Patr}.> {Paris} and I kisse euermore for him.
2587   <S {Mene}.> Ile haue my kisse sir: Lady by your leaue.
2588   <S {Cres}.> In kissing doe you render, or receiue.
2589   <S {Patr}.> Both take and giue.
2590   <S {Cres}.> Ile make my match to liue,
2591  *The kisse you take is better then you giue: therefore no
2592   kisse.
2593  *<S {Mene}.> Ile giue you boote, Ile giue you three for one.
2594   <S {Cres}.> You are an odde man, giue euen, or giue none.
2595   <S {Mene}.> An odde man Lady, euery man is odde.
2596   <S {Cres}.> No, {Paris} is not; for you know 'tis true,
2597   That you are odde, and he is euen with you.
2598   <S {Mene}.> You fillip me a'th' head.
2599   <S {Cres}.> No, Ile be sworne.
2600   <S {Vlis}.> It were no match, your naile against his horne:
2601   May I sweete Lady beg a kisse of you?
2602   <S {Cres}.> You may.
2603   <S {Vlis}.> I doe desire it.
2604   <S {Cres}.> Why begge then?
2605   <S {Vlis}.> Why then for {Venus} sake, giue me a kisse:
2606   When {Hellen} is a maide againe, and his===
2607   <S {Cres}.> I am your debtor, claime it when 'tis due.
      <P YYY3v>
2608   <S {Vlis}.> Neuer's my day, and then a kisse of you.
2609   <S {Diom}.> Lady a word, Ile bring you to your Father.
2610   <S {Nest}.> A woman of quicke sence.
2611   <S {Vlis}.> Fie, fie, vpon her:
2612   Ther's a language in her eye, her cheeke, her lip;
2613   Nay, her foote speakes, her wanton spirites looke out
2614   At euery ioynt, and motiue of her body:
2615   Oh these encounterers so glib of tongue,
2616   That giue a coasting welcome ere it comes;
2617   And wide vnclaspe the tables of their thoughts,
2618   To euery tickling reader: set them downe,
2619   For sluttish spoyles of opportunitie:
2620   And daughters of the game.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2621   <D {Enter all of Troy, Hector, Paris, Aeneas, Helenus}
2622   {and Attendants. Florish}.>
2623   <S {All}.> The Troians Trumpet.
2624   <S {Aga}.> Yonder comes the troope.
2625  *<S {Aene}.> Haile all you state of Greece: what shalbe  done
2626   To him that victory commands? or doe you purpose,
2627   A victor shall be knowne: will you the Knights
2628   Shall to the edge of all extremitie
2629   Pursue each other; or shall be diuided
2630   By any voyce, or order of the field: {Hector} bad aske?
2631   <S {Aga}.> Which way would {Hector} haue it?
2632   <S {Aene}.> He cares not, heele obey conditions.
2633   <S {Aga}.> 'Tis done like {Hector}, but securely done,
2634   A little proudly, and great deale disprising
2635   The Knight oppos'd.
2636   <S {Aene}.> If not {Achilles} sir, what is your name?
2637   <S {Achil}.> If not {Achilles}, nothing.
2638   <S {Aene}.> Therefore {Achilles}: but what ere, know this,
2639   In the extremity of great and little:
2640   Valour and pride excell themselues in {Hector};
2641   The one almost as infinite as all;
2642   The other blanke as nothing: weigh him well:
2643   And that which lookes like pride, is curtesie:
2644   This {Aiax} is halfe made of {Hectors} bloud;
2645   In loue wherof, halfe {Hector} staies at home:
2646   Halfe heart, halfe hand, halfe {Hector}, comes to seeke
2647   This blended Knight, halfe Troian, and halfe Greeke.
2648   <S {Achil}.> A maiden battaile then? O I perceiue you.
2649   <S {Aga}.> Here is sir, {Diomed}: goe gentle Knight,
2650   Stand by our {Aiax}: as you and Lord {Aeneas}
2651   Consent vpon the order of their fight,
2652   So be it: either to the vttermost,
2653   Or else a breach: the Combatants being kin,
2654   Halfe stints their strife, before their strokes begin.
2655   <S {Vlis}.> They are oppos'd already.
2656   <S {Aga}.> What Troian is that same that lookes so heauy?
2657   <S {Vlis}.> The yongest Sonne of {Priam};
2658   A true Knight; they call him {Troylus};
2659   Not yet mature, yet matchlesse, firme of word,
2660   Speaking in deedes, and deedelesse in his tongue;
2661   Not soone prouok't, nor being prouok't, soone calm'd;
2662   His heart and hand both open, and both free:
2663   For what he has, he giues; what thinkes, he shewes;
2664   Yet giues he not till iudgement guide his bounty,
2665   Nor dignifies an impaire thought with breath:
2666   Manly as {Hector}, but more dangerous;
2667   For {Hector} in his blaze of wrath subscribes
2668   To tender obiects; but he, in heate of action,
2669   Is more vindecatiue then iealous loue.
2670   They call him {Troylus}; and on him erect,
2671   A second hope, as fairely built as {Hector}.
2672   Thus saies {Aeneas}, one that knowes the youth,
2673   Euen to his inches: and with priuate soule,
2674   Did in great Illion thus translate him to me.  <D {Alarum}.>
2675   <S {Aga}.> They are in action.
2676   <S {Nest}.> Now {Aiax} hold thine owne.
2677   <S {Troy}.> {Hector}, thou sleep'st, awake thee.
2678  *<S {Aga}.> His blowes are wel dispos'd there {Aiax}.  <D {tru[m]pets} |({cease}
2679   <S {Diom}.> You must no more.
2680   <S {Aene}.> Princes enough, so please you.
2681   <S {Aia}.> I am not warme yet, let vs fight againe.
2682   <S {Diom}.> As {Hector} pleases.
2683   <S {Hect}.> Why then will I no more:
2684   Thou art great Lord, my Fathers sisters Sonne;
2685   A cousen german to great {Priams} seede:
2686   The obligation of our bloud forbids
2687   A gorie emulation 'twixt vs twaine:
2688   Were thy commixion, Greeke and Troian so,
2689   That thou could'st say, this hand is Grecian all,
2690   And this is Troian: the sinewes of this Legge,
2691   All Greeke, and this all Troy: my Mothers bloud
2692   Runs on the dexter cheeke, and this sinister
2693   Bounds in my fathers: by {Ioue} multipotent,
2694  *Thou should'st not beare from me a Greekish member
2695   Wherein my sword had not impressure made
2696   Of our ranke feud: but the iust gods gainsay,
2697   That any drop thou borrowd'st from thy mother,
2698   My sacred Aunt, should by my mortall Sword
2699   Be drained. Let me embrace thee {Aiax}:
2700   By him that thunders, thou hast lustie Armes;
2701   {Hector} would haue them fall vpon him thus.
2702   Cozen, all honor to thee.
2703   <S {Aia}.> I thanke thee {Hector}:
2704   Thou art too gentle, and too free a man:
2705   I came to kill thee Cozen, and beare hence
2706   A great addition, earned in thy death.
2707   <S {Hect}.> Not {Neoptolymus} so mirable,
2708   On whose bright crest, fame with her lowd'st (Oyes)
2709   Cries, This is he; could'st promise to himselfe,
2710   A thought of added honor, torne from {Hector}.
2711  *<S {Aene}.> There is expectance here from both the sides,
2712   What further you will doe?
2713   <S {Hect}.> Weele answere it:
2714   The issue is embracement: {Aiax}, farewell.
2715   <S {Aia}.> If I might in entreaties finde successe,
2716   As seld I haue the chance; I would desire
2717   My famous Cousin to our Grecian Tents.
2718   <S {Diom}.> 'Tis {Agamemnons} wish, and great {Achilles}
2719   Doth long to see vnarm'd the valiant {Hector}.
2720   <S {Hect}.> {Aeneas}, call my brother {Troylus} to me:
2721   And signifie this louing enterview
2722   To the expecters of our Troian part:
2723   Desire them home. Giue me thy hand, my Cousin:
2724   I will goe eate with thee, and see your Knights.
2725   <D {Enter Agamemnon and the rest}.>
2726   <S {Aia}.> Great {Agamemnon} comes to meete vs here.
2727  *<S {Hect}.> The worthiest of them, tell me name by name:
2728   But for {Achilles}, mine owne serching eyes
2729   Shall finde him by his large and portly size.
2730   <S {Aga}.> Worthy of Armes: as welcome as to one
2731   That would be rid of such an enemie.
2732   But that's no welcome: vnderstand more cleere
2733  *What's past, and what's to come, is strew'd with huskes
2734   And formelesse ruine of obliuion:
2735   But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
2736   Strain'd purely from all hollow bias drawing:
2737   Bids thee with most diuine integritie,
2738   From heart of very heart, great {Hector} welcome.
2739   <S {Hect}.> I thanke thee most imperious {Agamemnon}.
      <P YYY4><C B>
2740   <S {Aga}.> My well- fam'd Lord of Troy, no lesse to you.
2741  *<S {Men}.> Let me confirme my Princely brothers greeting,
2742   You brace of warlike Brothers, welcome hither.
2743   <S {Hect}.> Who must we answer?
2744   <S {Aene}.> The Noble {Menelaus}.
2745  *<S {Hect}.> O, you my Lord, by {Mars} his gauntlet thanks,
2746   Mocke not, that I affect th' vntraded Oath,
2747   Your {quondam} wife sweares still by {Venus} Gloue
2748   Shee's well, but bad me not commend her to you.
2749   <S {Men}.> Name her not now sir, she's a deadly Theame.
2750   <S {Hect}.> O pardon, I offend.
2751   <S {Nest}.> I haue (thou gallant Troyan) seene thee oft
2752   Labouring for destiny, make cruell way
2753  *Through rankes of Greekish youth: and I haue seen thee
2754   As hot as {Perseus}, spurre thy Phrygian Steed,
2755   And seene thee scorning forfeits and subduments,
2756   When thou hast hung thy aduanced sword i'th' ayre,
2757   Not letting it decline, on the declined:
2758   That I haue said vnto my standers by,
2759   Loe Iupiter is yonder, dealing life.
2760   And I haue seene thee pause, and take thy breath,
2761   When that a ring of Greekes haue hem'd thee in,
2762   Like an Olympian wrestling. This haue I seene,
2763   But this thy countenance (still lockt in steele)
2764   I neuer saw till now. I knew thy Grandsire,
2765   And once fought with him; he was a Souldier good,
2766   But by great Mars, the Captaine of vs all,
2767   Neuer like thee. Let an oldman embrace thee,
2768   And (worthy Warriour) welcome to our Tents.
2769   <S {Aene}.> 'Tis the old {Nestor}.
2770   <S {Hect}.> Let me embrace thee good old Chronicle,
2771   That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
2772   Most reuerend {Nestor}, I am glad to claspe thee.
2773  *<S {Ne}.> I would my armes could match thee in contention
2774   As they contend with thee in courtesie.
2775   <S {Hect}.> I would they could.
2776  *<S {Nest}.> Ha? by this white beard I'ld fight with thee to
2777  *morrow. Well, welcom, welcome: I haue seen the time.
2778   <S {Vlys}.> I wonder now, how yonder City stands,
2779   When we haue heere her Base and pillar by vs.
2780   <S {Hect}.> I know your fauour Lord {Vlysses} well.
2781   Ah sir, there's many a Greeke and Troyan dead,
2782   Since first I saw your selfe, and {Diomed}
2783   In Illion, on your Greekish Embassie.
2784   <S {Vlys}.> Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.
2785   My prophesie is but halfe his iourney yet;
2786   For yonder wals that pertly front your Towne,
2787   Yond Towers, whose wanton tops do busse the clouds,
2788   Must kisse their owne feet.
2789   <S {Hect}.> I must not beleeue you:
2790   There they stand yet: and modestly I thinke,
2791   The fall of euery Phrygian stone will cost
2792   A drop of Grecian blood: the end crownes all,
2793   And that old common Arbitrator, Time,
2794   Will one day end it.
2795   <S {Vlys}.> So to him we leaue it.
2796   Most gentle, and most valiant {Hector}, welcome;
2797   After the Generall, I beseech you next
2798   To Feast with me, and see me at my Tent.
2799   <S {Achil}.> I shall forestall thee Lord {Vlysses}, thou:
2800   Now {Hector} I haue fed mine eyes on thee,
2801   I haue with exact view perus'd thee {Hector},
2802   And quoted ioynt by ioynt.
2803   <S {Hect}.> Is this {Achilles}?
2804   <S {Achil}.> I am {Achilles}.
2805   <S {Hect}.> Stand faire I prythee, let me looke on thee.
2806   <S {Achil}.> Behold thy fill.
2807   <S {Hect}.> Nay, I haue done already.
2808   <S {Achil}.> Thou art #to breefe, I will the second time,
2809   As I would buy thee, view thee, limbe by limbe.
2810   <S {Hect}.> O like a Booke of sport thou'lt reade me ore:
2811   But there's more in me then thou vnderstand'st.
2812   Why doest thou so oppresse me with thine eye?
2813  *<S {Achil}.> Tell me you Heauens, in which part of his body
2814   Shall I destroy him? Whether three, or there, or there,
2815   That I may giue the locall wound a name,
2816   And make distinct the very breach, where- out
2817   {Hectors} great spirit flew. Answer me heauens.
2818  *<S {Hect}.> It would discredit the blest Gods, proud man,
2819   To answer such a question: Stand againe;
2820   Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly,
2821   As to prenominate in nice coniecture
2822   Where thou wilt hit me dead?
2823   <S {Achil}.> I tell thee yea.
2824   <S {Hect}.> Wert thou the Oracle to tell me so,
2825   I'ld not beleeue thee: henceforth guard thee well,
2826   For Ile not kill thee there, not there, nor there,
2827   But by the forge that stythied Mars his helme,
2828   Ile kill thee euery where, yea, ore and ore.
2829   You wisest Grecians, pardon me this bragge,
2830   His insolence drawes folly from my lips,
2831   But Ile endeuour deeds to match these words,
2832   Or may I neuer===
2833   <S {Aiax}.> Do not chafe thee Cosin:
2834   And you {Achilles}, let these threats alone
2835   Till accident, or purpose bring you too't.
2836   You may euery day enough of {Hector}
2837   If you haue stomacke. The generall state I feare,
2838   Can scarse intreat you to be odde with him.
2839   <S {Hect}.> I pray you let vs see you in the field,
2840   We haue had pelting Warres since you refus'd
2841   The Grecians cause.
2842   <S {Achil}.> Dost thou intreat me {Hector}?
2843   To morrow do I meete thee fell as death,
2844   To night, all Friends.
2845   <S {Hect}.> Thy hand vpon that match.
2846   <S {Aga}.> First, all you Peeres of Greece go to my Tent,
2847   There in the full conuiue you: Afterwards,
2848   As {Hectors} leysure, and your bounties shall
2849   Concurre together, seuerally intreat him.
2850   Beate lowd the Taborins, let the Trumpets blow,
2851  *That this great Souldier may his welcome know.  <D {Exeunt}>
2852   <S {Troy}.> My Lord {Vlysses}, tell me I beseech you,
2853   In what place of the Field doth {Calchas} keepe?
2854   <S {Vlys}.> At {Menelaus} Tent, most Princely {Troylus},
2855   There {Diomed} doth feast with him to night,
2856   Who neither lookes on heauen, nor on earth,
2857   But giues all gaze and bent of amorous view
2858   On the faire {Cressid}.
2859  *<S {Troy}.> Shall I (sweet Lord) be bound to thee so much,
2860   After we part from {Agamemnons} Tent,
2861   To bring me thither?
2862   <S {Vlys}.> You shall command me sir:
2863   As gentle tell me, of what Honour was
2864   This {Cressida} in Troy, had she no Louer there
2865   That wailes her absence?
2866   <S {Troy}.> O sir, to such as boasting shew their scarres,
2867   A mocke is due: will you walke on my Lord?
2868   She was belou'd, she lou'd; she is, and dooth;
2869   But still sweet Loue is food for Fortunes tooth.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2870   <D {Enter Achilles, and Patroclus}.>
2871  *<S {Achil}.> Ile heat his blood with Greekish wine to night,
      <P YYY4v>
2872   Which with my Cemitar Ile coole to morrow:
2873   {Patroclus}, let vs Feast him to the hight.
2874   <S {Pat}.> Heere comes {Thersites}.  <D {Enter Thersites}.>
2875   <S {Achil}.> How now, thou core of Enuy?
2876   Thou crusty batch of Nature, what's the newes?
2877  *<S {Ther}.> Why thou picture of what thou seem'st, & Idoll
2878   of Ideot- worshippers, here's a Letter for thee.
2879   <S {Achil}.> From whence, Fragment?
2880   <S {Ther}.> Why thou full dish of Foole, from Troy.
2881   <S {Pat}.> Who keepes the Tent now?
2882   <S {Ther}.> The Surgeons box, or the Patients wound.
2883  *<S {Patr}.> Well said aduersity, and what need these tricks?
2884  *<S {Ther}.> Prythee be silent boy, I profit not by thy talke,
2885   thou art thought to be {Achilles} male Varlot.
2886   <S {Patro}.> Male Varlot you Rogue? What's that?
2887  *<S {Ther}.> Why his masculine Whore. Now the rotten
2888  *diseases of the South, guts- griping Ruptures, Catarres,
2889  *Loades #a grauell i'th' backe, Lethargies, cold Palsies, and

2893   mean'st thou to curse thus?
2894   <S {Ther}.> Do I curse thee?
2895  *<S {Patr}.> Why no, you ruinous #But, you whorson indi-stinguishable
2896   Curre.
2897  *<S {Ther}.> No? why art thou then exasperate, thou idle,
2898  *immateriall skiene of Sleyd silke; thou greene Sarcenet
2899  *flap for a sore eye, thou tassell of a Prodigals purse thou:
2900  *Ah how the poore world is pestred with such water- flies,
2901   diminutiues of Nature.
2902   <S {Pat}.> Out gall.
2903   <S {Ther}.> Finch Egge.
2904   <S {Ach}.> My sweet {Patroclus}, I am thwarted quite
2905   From my great purpose in to morrowes battell:
2906   Heere is a Letter from Queene {Hecuba},
2907   A token from her daughter, my faire Loue,
2908   Both taxing me, and gaging me to keepe
2909   An Oath that I haue sworne. I will not breake it,
2910   Fall Greekes, faile Fame, Honor or go, or stay,
2911   My maior vow lyes heere; this Ile obay:
2912   Come, come {Thersites}, helpe to trim my Tent,
2913   This night in banquetting must all be spent.
2914   Away {Patroclus}.  <D {Exit}.>
2915  *<S {Ther}.> With too much bloud, and too little Brain, these
2916  *two may run mad: but if with too much braine, and too
2917  *little blood, they do, Ile be a curer of madmen. Heere's

2919  *Quailes, but he has not so much Braine as eare- wax; and
2920  *the goodly transformation of Iupiter there his Brother,

2928  *an Owle, a Puttocke, or a Herring without a Roe,
2929  *I would not care: but to be {Menelaus}, I would conspire
2930  *against Destiny. Aske me not what I would be, if I were
2931  *not {Thersites}: for I care not to bee the lowse of a Lazar,

3008  *<S {Dio}.> No, no, good night: Ile be your foole no more.
3009   <S {Troy}.> Thy better must.

3011   <S {Troy}.> O plague and madnesse!
3012  *<S {Vlis}.> You are moued Prince, let vs depart I pray you,
3013   Lest your displeasure should enlarge it selfe
3014   To wrathfull tearmes: this place is dangerous;
3015   The time right deadly: I beseech you goe.
3016   <S {Troy}.> Behold, I pray you.
3017   <S {Vlis}.> Nay, good my Lord goe off:
3018   You flow to great distraction: come my Lord?
3019   <S {Troy}.> I pray thee stay?
3020   <S {Vlis}.> You haue not patience, come.
3021   <S {Troy}.> I pray you stay? by #hell and #hell torments,
3022   I will not speake a word.
3023   <S {Dio}.> And so good night.
3024   <S {Cres}.> Nay, but you part in anger.
3025   <S {Troy}.> Doth that grieue thee? O withered truth!
3026   <S {Vlis}.> Why, how now Lord?
3027   <S {Troy}.> By {Ioue} I will be patient.
3028   <S {Cres}.> Gardian? why Greeke?
3029   <S {Dio}.> Fo, fo, adew, you palter.
3030   <S {Cres}.> In faith I doe not: come hither once againe.
3031  *<S {Vlis}.> You shake my Lord at something; will you goe?
3032   you will breake out.
3033   <S {Troy}.> She stroakes his cheeke.
3034   <S {Vlis}.> Come, come.
3035   <S {Troy}.> Nay stay, by {Ioue} I will not speake a word.
3036   There is betweene my #will, and all offences,
3037   A guard of patience; stay a little while.
3038  *<S {Ther}.> How the diuell Luxury with his fat rumpe and

3040   <S {Dio}.> But will you then?
3041   <S {Cres}.> In faith I will lo; neuer trust me else.
3042   <S {Dio}.> Giue me some token for the surety of it.
3043   <S {Cres}.> Ile fetch you one. <D {Exit}.>
3044   <S {Vlis}.> You haue sworne patience.
3045   <S {Troy}.> Feare me not sweete Lord.
3046   I will not be my selfe, nor haue cognition
3047   Of what I feele: I am all patience.  <D {Enter Cressid}.>
3048   <S {Ther}.> Now the pledge, now, now, now.
3049   <S {Cres}.> Here {Diomed}, keepe this Sleeue.
3050   <S {Troy}.> O beautie! where is thy Faith?
3051   <S {Vlis}.> My Lord.
3052   <S {Troy}.> I will be patient, outwardly I will.
3053   <S {Cres}.> You looke vpon that Sleeue? behold it well:
3054   He lou'd me: O false wench: giue't me againe.
3055   <S {Dio}.> Whose #was't?
3056   <S {Cres}.> It is no matter now I haue't againe.
3057   I will not meete with you to morrow night:
3058   I prythee {Diomed} visite me no more.
3059   <S {Ther}.> Now she sharpens: well said Whetstone.
3060   <S {Dio}.> I shall haue it.
3061   <S {Cres}.> What, this?
3062   <S {Dio}.> #I that.
3063   <S {Cres}.> O all you gods! O prettie, prettie pledge;
3064   Thy Maister now lies thinking in his bed
3065   Of thee and me, and sighes, and takes my Gloue,
3066   And giues memoriall daintie kisses to it;
3067   As I kisse thee.
3068   <S {Dio}.> Nay, doe not snatch it from me.
3069   <S {Cres}.> He that takes that, takes my heart withall.
3070   <S {Dio}.> I had your heart before, this followes it.
3071   <S {Troy}.> I did sweare patience.
3072  *<S {Cres}.> You shall not haue it {Diomed}; faith you shall not:
3073   Ile giue you something else.
3074   <S {Dio}.> I will haue this: whose was it?
3075   <S {Cres}.> It is no matter.
3076   <S {Dio}.> Come tell me whose it was?
3077   <S {Cres}.> 'Twas one that lou'd me better then you will.
3078   But now you haue it, take it.
3079   <S {Dio}.> Whose was it?
3080   <S {Cres}.> By all {Dianas} waiting women yond:
3081   And by her selfe, I will not tell you whose.
3082   <S {Dio}.> To morrow will I weare it on my Helme,
3083   And grieue his spirit that dares not challenge it.
3084  *<S {Troy}.> Wert thou the diuell, and wor'st it on thy horne,
3085   It should be challeng'd.
3086   <S {Cres}.> Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not:
3087   I will not keepe my word.
3088   <S {Dio}.> Why then farewell,
3089   Thou neuer shalt mocke {Diomed} againe.
3090   <S {Cres}.> You shall not goe: one cannot speake a word,
3091   But it strait starts you.
3092   <S {Dio}.> I doe not like this fooling.
3093  *<S {Ther}.> Nor I by {Pluto}: but that that likes not me, plea-ses
3094   me best.
3095   <S {Dio}.> What shall I come? the houre.
3096   <S {Cres}.> #I, come: O {Ioue}! doe, come: I shall be plagu'd.
3097   <S {Dio}.> Farewell till then.  <D {Exit}.>
3098   <S {Cres}.> Good night: I prythee come:
3099   {#Troylus} farewell; one eye yet lookes on thee;
3100   But with my heart, the other eye, doth see.
3101   Ah poore our sexe; this fault in vs I finde:
3102   The errour of our eye, directs our minde.
3103   What errour leads, must erre: O then conclude,
3104   Mindes swai'd by eyes, are full of turpitude.  <D {Exit}.>
3105  *<S {Ther}.> A proofe of strength she could not publish more;
3106   Vnlesse she say, my minde is now turn'd whore.
3107   <S {Vlis}.> Al's done my Lord.
3108   <S {Troy}.> It is.
3109   <S {Vlis}.> Why stay we then?
3110   <S {Troy}.> To make a recordation to my soule
3111   Of euery syllable that here was spoke:
3112   But if I tell how these two did coact;
3113   Shall I not lye, in publishing a truth?
3114   Sith yet there is a credence in my heart:
3115   An esperance so obstinately strong,
3116   That doth inuert that test of eyes and eares;
3117   As if those organs had deceptious functions,
3118   Created onely to calumniate.
3119   Was {Cressed} here?
3120   <S {Vlis}.> I cannot coniure Troian.
3121   <S {Troy}.> She was not sure.
3122   <S {Vlis}.> Most sure she was.
3123   <S {Troy}.> Why my negation hath no taste of madnesse?
3124   <S {Vlis}.> Nor mine my Lord: {Cressid} was here but now.
3125   <S {Troy}.> Let it not be beleeu'd for womanhood:
3126   Thinke we had mothers; doe not giue aduantage
3127   To stubborne Criticks, apt without a theame
3128   For deprauation, to square the generall sex
3129   By {Cressids} rule. Rather thinke this not {Cressid}.
3130  *<S {Vlis}.> What hath she done Prince, that can soyle our
3131   mothers?
3132   <S {Troy}.> Nothing at all, vnlesse that this were she.
3133   <S {Ther}.> Will he swagger himselfe out on's owne eyes?
3134   <S {Troy}.> This she? no, this is {Diomeds} {Cressida}:
3135   If beautie haue a soule, this is not she:
      <P YYY5v>
3136   If soules guide vowes; if vowes are sanctimonie;
3137   If sanctimonie be the gods delight:
3138   If there be rule in vnitie it selfe,
3139   This is not she: O madnesse of discourse!
3140   That cause sets vp, with, and against thy selfe
3141   By foule authoritie: where reason can reuolt
3142   Without perdition, and losse assume all reason,
3143   Without reuolt. This is, and is not {Cressid}:
3144   Within my soule, there doth conduce a sight
3145   Of this strange nature, that a thing inseperate,
3146   Diuides more wider then the skie and earth:
3147   And yet the spacious bredth of this diuision,
3148   Admits no Orifex for a point as subtle,
3149   As {Ariachnes} broken woofe to enter:
3150   Instance, O instance! strong as {Plutoes} gates:
3151   {Cressid} is mine, tied with the bonds of heauen;
3152   Instance, O instance, strong as heauen it selfe:
3153   The bonds of heauen are slipt, dissolu'd, and loos'd,
3154   And with another knot fiue finger tied,
3155   The fractions of her faith, orts of her loue:
3156   The fragments, scraps, the bits, and greazie reliques,
3157   Of her ore- eaten faith, are bound to {Diomed}
3158   <S {Vlis}.> May worthy {Troylus} be halfe attached
3159   With that which here his passion doth expresse?
3160   <S {Troy}.> #I Greeke: and that shall be divulged well
3161   In Characters, as red as {Mars} his heart
3162   Inflam'd with {Venus}: neuer did yong man fancy
3163   With so eternall, and so fixt a soule.
3164   Harke Greek: as much I doe {Cressida} loue;
3165   So much by weight, hate I her {Diomed},
3166   That Sleeue is mine, that heele beare in his Helme:
3167   Were it a Caske compos'd by {Vulcans} skill,
3168   My Sword should bite it: Not the dreadfull spout,
3169   Which Shipmen doe the Hurricano call,
3170   Constring'd in masse by the almighty Fenne,
3171   Shall dizzie with more clamour Neptunes eare
3172   In his discent; then shall my prompted sword,
3173   Falling on {Diomed}.
3174   <S {Ther}.> Heele tickle it for his concupie.
3175   <S {Troy}.> O {Cressid}! O false {Cressid}! false, false, false:
3176   Let all vntruths stand by thy stained name,
3177   And theyle seeme glorious.
3178   <S {Vlis}.> O containe your selfe:
3179   Your passion drawes eares hither.
3180   <D {Enter Aeneas}.>
3181  *<S {Aene}.> I haue beene seeking you this houre my Lord:
3182   {#Hector} by this is arming him in Troy.
3183   <S {#Aiax}> your Guard, staies to conduct you home.
3184  *<S {Troy}.> Haue with you Prince: my curteous Lord adew:
3185   Farewell reuolted faire: and {Diomed},
3186   Stand fast, and weare a Castle on thy head.
3187   <S {Vli}.> Ile bring you to the Gates.
3188   <S {Troy}.> Accept distracted thankes.
3189   <D {Exeunt Troylus, Aeneas, and Vlisses}.>
3190  *<S {Ther}.> Would I could meete that roague {Diomed}, I
3191  *would croke like a Rauen: I would bode, I would bode:
3192  *{Patroclus} will giue me any thing for the intelligence of
3193  *his whore: the Parrot will not doe more for an Almond,
3194  *then he for a commodious drab: Lechery, lechery, still
3195  *warres and lechery, nothing else holds fashion. A burning
3196   diuell take them.
3197   <D {Enter Hecter and Andromache}.>
3198  *<S {And}.> When was my Lord so much vngently temper'd,
3199   To stop his eares against admonishment?
3200   Vnarme, vnarme, and doe not fight to day.
3201   <S {Hect}.> You traine me to offend you: get you gone.
3202   By the euerlasting gods, Ile goe.
3203  *<S {And}.> My dreames will sure proue ominous to the day.
3204   <S {Hect}.> No more I say.  <D {Enter Cassandra}.>
3205   <S {Cassa}.> Where is my brother {Hector}?
3206   <S {And}.> Here sister, arm'd, and bloudy in intent:
3207   Consort with me in loud and deere petition:
3208   Pursue we him on knees: for I haue dreampt
3209   Of bloudy turbulence; and this whole night
3210  *Hath nothing beene but shapes, and formes of slaughter.
3211   <S {Cass}.> O, 'tis true.
3212   <S {Hect}.> Ho? bid my Trumpet sound.
3213  *<S {Cass}.> No notes of sallie, for the heauens, sweet brother.
3214   <S {Hect}.> Begon I say: the gods haue heard me sweare.
3215   <S {Cass}.> The gods are deafe to hot and peeuish vowes;
3216   They are polluted offrings, more abhord
3217   Then spotted Liuers in the sacrifice.
3218   <S {And}.> O be perswaded, doe not count it holy,
3219   To hurt by being iust; it is as lawfull:
3220   For we would count giue much to as violent thefts,
3221   And rob in the behalfe of charitie.
3222   <S {Cass}.> It is the purpose that makes strong the vowe;
3223   But vowes to euery purpose must not hold:
3224   Vnarme sweete {Hector}.
3225   <S {Hect}.> Hold you still I say;
3226   Mine honour keepes the weather of my fate:
3227   Life euery man holds deere, but the deere man
3228   Holds honor farre more precious, deere, then life.
3229   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
3230   How now yong man? mean'st thou to fight to day?
3231   <S {And}.> {Cassandra}, call my father to perswade.
3232   <D {Exit Cassandra}.>
3233  *<S {Hect}.> No faith yong {Troylus}; doffe thy harnesse youth:
3234   I am to day ith' vaine of Chiualrie:
3235   Let grow thy Sinews till their knots be strong;
3236   And tempt not yet the brushes of the warre.
3237   Vnarme thee, goe; and doubt thou not braue boy,
3238   Ile stand to day, for thee, and me, and Troy.
3239   <S {Troy}.> Brother, you haue a vice of mercy in you;
3240   Which better fits a Lyon, then a man.
3241  *<S {Hect}.> What vice is that? good {Troylus} chide me for it.
3242   <S {Troy}.> When many times the captiue Grecian fals,
3243   Euen in the fanne and winde of your faire Sword:
3244   You bid them rise, and liue.
3245   <S {Hect}.> O 'tis faire play.
3246   <S {Troy}.> Fooles play, by heauen {Hector}.
3247   <S {Hect}.> How now? how now?
3248   <S {Troy}.> For th' loue of all the gods
3249   Let's leaue the Hermit Pitty with our Mothers,
3250   And when we haue our Armors buckled on,
3251   The venom'd vengeance ride vpon our swords,
3252   Spur them to ruthfull worke, reine them from ruth.
3253   <S {Hect}.> Fie, sauage, fie.
3254   <S {Troy}.> {Hector}, then 'tis warres.
3255   <S {Hect}.> {Troylus}, I would not haue you fight to day.
3256   <S {Troy}.> Who should with- hold me?
3257   Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of {Mars},
3258   Beckning with fierie trunchion my retire;
3259   Not {Priamus}, and {Hecuba} on knees;
3260   Their eyes ore- galled with recourse of teares;
3261   Nor you my brother, with your true sword drawne
3262   Oppos'd to hinder me, should stop my way:
3263   But by my ruine.
3264   <D {Enter Priam and Cassandra}.>
3265   <S {Cass}.> Lay hold vpon him {Priam}, hold him fast:
3266   He is thy crutch; now if thou loose thy stay,
3267   Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
      <P YYY6>
3268   Fall all together.
3269   <S {Priam}.> Come {Hector}, come, goe backe:
3270   Thy wife hath dreampt: thy mother hath had visions;
3271   {Cassandra} doth foresee; and I my selfe,
3272   Am like a Prophet suddenly enrapt,
3273   To tell thee that this day is ominous:
3274   Therefore come backe.
3275   <S {Hect}.> {Aeneas} is #a field,
3276   And I do stand engag'd to many Greekes,
3277   Euen in the faith of valour, to appeare
3278   This morning to them.
3279   <S {Priam}.> #I, but thou shalt not goe,
3280   <S {Hect}.> I must not breake my faith:
3281   You know me dutifull, therefore deare sir,
3282   Let me not shame respect; but giue me leaue
3283   To take that course by your consent and voice,
3284   Which you doe here forbid me, Royall {Priam}.
3285   <S {Cass}.> O {Priam}, yeelde not to him.
3286   <S {And}.> Doe not deere father.
3287   <S {Hect}.> {Andromache} I am offended with you:
3288   Vpon the loue you beare me, get you in.
3289   <D {Exit Andromache}.>
3290   <S {Troy}.> This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girle,
3291   Makes all these bodements.
3292   <S {Cass}.> O farewell, deere {Hector}:
3293   Looke how thou diest; looke how thy eye turnes pale:
3294   Looke how thy wounds doth bleede at many vents:
3295   Harke how Troy roares; how {Hecuba} cries out;
3296   How poore {Andromache} shrils her dolour forth;
3297   Behold distraction, frenzie, and amazement,
3298   Like witlesse Antickes one another meete,
3299   And all cry {Hector}, {Hector}s dead: O {Hector}!
3300   <S {Troy}.> Away, away.
3301   <S {Cas}.> Farewell: yes, soft: {Hector} I take my leaue;
3302   Thou do'st thy selfe, and all our Troy deceiue.  <D {Exit}.>
3303   <S {Hect}.> You are amaz'd, my Liege, at her exclaime:
3304   Goe in and cheere the Towne, weele forth and fight:
3305   Doe deedes of praise, and tell you them at night.
3306  *<S {Priam}.> Farewell: the gods with safetie stand about
3307   thee.  <D {Alarum}.>
3308   <S {Troy}.> They are at it, harke: proud {Diomed}, beleeue
3309   I come to loose my arme, or winne my sleeue.
3310   <D {Enter Pandar}.>
3311   <S {Pand}.> Doe you heare my Lord? do you heare?
3312   <S {Troy}.> What now?
3313   <S {Pand}.> Here's a Letter come from yond poore girle.
3314   <S {Troy}.> Let me reade.
3315  *<S {Pand}.> A whorson tisicke, a whorson rascally tisicke,
3316  *so troubles me; and the foolish fortune of this girle, and
3317  *what one thing, what another, that I shall leaue you one
3318  *o'th's dayes: and I haue a rheume in mine eyes too; and
3319  *such an ache in my bones; that vnlesse a man were curst,
3320  *I cannot tell what to thinke on't. What sayes shee
3321   there?
3322  *<S {Troy}.> Words, words, meere words, no matter from
3323   the heart;
3324   Th' effect doth operate another way.
3325   Goe winde to winde, there turne and change together:
3326   My loue with words and errors still she feedes;
3327   But edifies another with her deedes.
3328   <S {Pand}.> Why, but heare you?
3329   <S {Troy}.> Hence brother lackie; ignomie and shame
3330   Pursue thy life, and liue aye with thy name.
3331   <D {A Larum}.>  <D {Exeunt}.>
3332   <D {Enter Thersites in excursion}.>
3333  *<S {Ther}.> Now they are clapper- clawing one another, Ile
3334  *goe looke on: that dissembling abhominable varlet {Dio-mede},
3335  *has got that same scuruie, doting, foolish yong
3336  *knaues Sleeue of Troy, there in his Helme: I would faine
3337  *see them meet; that, that same yong Troian asse, that loues
3338  *the whore there, might send that Greekish whore- mai-sterly
3339  *villaine, with the Sleeue, backe to the dissembling
3340  *luxurious drabbe, of a sleeuelesse errant. O'th' tother side,
3341  *the pollicie of those craftie swearing rascals; that stole
3342  *old Mouse- eaten dry cheese, {Nestor}: and that same dog-foxe
3343  *<S {Vlisses}>, is not prou'd worth a Black- berry. They set
3344  *me vp in pollicy, that mungrill curre {Aiax} against that
3345  *dogge of as bad a kinde, {Achilles}. And now is the curre
3346  *{#Aiax} prouder then the curre {Achilles}, and will not arme
3347  *to day. Whereupon, the Grecians began to proclaime
3348  *barbarisme; and pollicie growes into an #ill opinion.
3349   <D {Enter Diomed and Troylus}.>
3350   Soft, here comes Sleeue, and th' other.
3351  *<S {Troy}.> Flye not: for should'st thou take the Riuer Stix,
3352   I would swim after.
3353   <S {Diom}.> Thou do'st miscall retire:
3354   I doe not flye, but aduantagious care
3355   Withdrew me from the oddes of multitude:
3356   Haue at thee?
3357  *<S {Ther}.> Hold thy whore Grecian: now for thy whore
3358   Troian: Now the Sleeue, now the Sleeue.
3359   <D {Enter Hector}.>
3360  *<S {Hect}.> What art thou Greek? art thou for {Hectors} match?
3361   Art thou of bloud, and honour?
3362  *<S {Ther}.> No, no: I am a rascall: a scuruie railing knaue:
3363   a very filthy roague.
3364   <S {Hect}.> I doe beleeue thee, liue.
3365  *<S {Ther}.> God #a mercy, that thou wilt beleeue me; but a
3366  *plague breake thy necke === for frighting me: what's be-come
3367  *of the wenching rogues? I thinke they haue
3368  *swallowed one another. I would laugh at that mira-cle
3369  *=== yet in a sort, lecherie eates it selfe: Ile seeke them.
3370   <D {Exit}.>
3371   <D {Enter Diomed and Seruants}.>
3372   <S {Dio}.> Goe, goe, my seruant, take thou {Troylus} Horse;
3373   Present the faire Steede to my Lady {Cressid}:
3374   Fellow, commend my seruice to her beauty;
3375   Tell her, I haue chastis'd the amorous Troyan,
3376   And am her Knight by proofe.
3377   <S {Ser}.> I goe my Lord.  <D {Enter Agamemnon}.>
3378   <S {Aga}.> Renew, renew, the fierce {Polidamus}
3379   Hath beate downe {Menon}: bastard {Margarelon}
3380   Hath {Doreus} prisoner.
3381   And stands Calossus- wise wauing his beame,
3382   Vpon the pashed courses of the Kings:
3383   {Epistropus} and {Cedus, Polixines} is slaine;
3384   {Amphimacus}, and {Thous} deadly hurt;
3385   {Patroclus} tane or slaine, and {Palamedes}
3386   Sore hurt and bruised; the dreadfull Sagittary
3387   Appauls our numbers, haste we {Diomed}
3388   To re- enforcement, or we perish all.
3389   <D {Enter Nestor}.>
3390   <S {Nest}.> Goe beare {Patroclus} body to {Achilles},
3391   And bid the snaile- pac'd {Aiax} arme for shame;
3392   There is a thousand {Hectors} in the field:
3393   Now here he fights on {Galathe} his Horse,
3394   And there lacks worke: anon he's there #a foote,
3395   And there they flye or dye, like scaled sculs,
      <P YYY6v><C U>
3396   Before the belching Whale; then is he yonder,
3397   And there the straying Greekes, ripe for his edge,
3398   Fall downe before him, like the mowers swath;
3399   Here, there, and euery where, he leaues and takes;
3400   Dexteritie so obaying appetite,
3401   That what he will, he does, and does so much,
3402   That proofe is call'd impossibility.
3403   <D {Enter Vlisses}.>
3404   <S {Vlis}.> Oh, courage, courage Princes: great {Achilles}
3405   Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance;
3406   {Patroclus} wounds haue rouz'd his drowzie bloud,
3407   Together with his mangled {Myrmidons},
3408   That noselesse, handlesse, hackt and chipt, come to him;
3409   Crying on {Hector}. {Aiax} hath lost a friend,
3410   And foames at mouth, and he is arm'd, and at it:
3411   Roaring for {Troylus}; who hath done to day,
3412   Mad and fanasticke execution;
3413   Engaging and redeeming of himselfe.
3414   With such a carelesse force, and forcelesse care,
3415  *As if that luck in very spight of cunning, bad him win all.
3416   <D {Enter Aiax}.>
3417   <S {Aia}.> {Troylus}, thou coward {Troylus}. <D {Exit}.>
3418   <S {Dio}.> #I, there, there.
3419   <S {Nest}.> So, so, we draw together.  <D {Exit}.>
3420   <D {Enter Achilles}.>
3421   <S {Achil}.> Where is this {Hector}?
3422   Come, come, thou boy- queller, shew thy face:
3423   Know what it is to meete {Achilles} angry.
3424   {Hector}, wher's {Hector}? I will none but {Hector}.  <D {Exit}.>
3425   <D {Enter Aiax}.>
3426   <S {Aia}.> {Troylus}, thou coward {Troylus}, shew thy head.
3427   <D {Enter Diomed}.>
3428   <S {Diom}.> {Troylus}, I say, wher's {Troylus}?
3429   <S {Aia}.> What would'st thou?
3430   <S {Diom}.> I would correct him.
3431   <S {Aia}.> Were I the Generall,
3432   Thou should'st haue my office,
3433   Ere that correction: {Troylus} I say, what {Troylus}?
3434   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
3435   <S {Troy}.> Oh traitour {Diomed}!
3436   Turne thy false face thou traytor,
3437   And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.
3438   <S {Dio}.> Ha, art thou there?
3439   <S {Aia}.> Ile fight with him alone, stand {Diomed}.
3440   <S {Dio}.> He is my prize, I will not looke vpon.
3441   <S {Troy}.> Come both you coging Greekes, haue at you
3442   both.  <D {Exit Troylus}.>
3443   <D {Enter Hector}.>
3444  *<S {Hect}.> Yea {Troylus}? O well fought my yongest Brother.
3445   <D {Enter Achilles}.>
3446   <S {Achil}.> Now doe I see thee; haue at thee {Hector}.
3447   <S {Hect}.> Pause if thou wilt.
3448   <S {Achil}.> I doe disdaine thy curtesie, proud Troian;
3449   Be happy that my armes are out of vse:
3450   My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
3451   But thou anon shalt heare of me againe:
3452   Till when, goe seeke thy fortune.  <D {Exit}.>
3453   <S {Hect}.> Fare thee well:
3454   I would haue beene much more a fresher man,
3455   Had I expected thee: how now my Brother?
3456   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
3457   <S {Troy}.> {Aiax} hath tane {Aeneas}; shall it be?
3458   No, by the flame of yonder glorious heauen,
3459   He shall not carry him: Ile be tane too,
3460   Or bring him off: Fate heare me what I say;
      <C J>
3461   I wreake not, though thou end my life to day.  <D {Exit}.>
3462   <D {Enter one in Armour}.>
3463   <S {Hect}.> Stand, stand, thou Greeke,
3464   Thou art a goodly marke:
3465   No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well,
3466   Ile frush it, and vnlocke the riuets all,
3467   But Ile be maister of it: wilt thou not beast abide?
3468   Why then flye on, Ile hunt thee for thy hide.  <D {Exit}.>
3469   <D {Enter Achilles with Myrmidons}.>
3470   <S {Achil}.> Come here about me you my {Myrmidons}:
3471   Marke what I say; attend me where I wheele:
3472   Strike not a stroake, but keepe your selues in breath;
3473   And when I haue the bloudy {Hector} found,
3474   Empale him with your weapons round about:
3475   In fellest manner execute your arme.
3476   Follow me sirs, and my proceedings eye;
3477   It is decreed, {Hector} the great must dye.  <D {Exit}.>
3478   <D {Enter Thersites, Menelaus, and Paris}.>
3479  *<S {Ther}.> The Cuckold and the Cuckold maker are at it:
3480  *now bull, now dogge, lowe; {Paris} lowe; now my dou-ble
3481  *hen'd sparrow; lowe {Paris}, lowe; the bull has the
3482   game: ware hornes ho?
3483   <D {Exit Paris and Menelaus}.>
3484   <D {Enter Bastard}.>
3485   <S {Bast}.> Turne slaue and fight.
3486   <S {Ther}.> What art thou?
3487   <S {Bast}.> A Bastard Sonne of {Priams}.
3488  *<S {Ther}.> I am a Bastard too, I loue Bastards, I am a Ba-stard
3489  *begot, Bastard instructed, Bastard in minde, Bastard
3490  *in valour, in euery thing illegitimate: one Beare will not
3491  *bite another, and wherefore should one Bastard? take
3492  *heede, the quarrel's most ominous to vs: if the Sonne of a

3494   Bastard.
3495   <S {Bast}.> The diuell take thee coward.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3496   <D {Enter Hector}.>
3497   <S {Hect}.> Most putrified core so faire without:
3498   Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
3499   Now is my daies worke done; Ile take good breath:
3500   Rest Sword, thou hast thy fill of bloud and death.
3501   <D {Enter Achilles and his Myrmidons}.>
3502   <S {Achil}.> Looke {Hector} how the Sunne begins to set;
3503   How vgly night comes breathing at his heeles,
3504   Euen with the vaile and darking of the Sunne.
3505   To close the day vp, {Hectors} life is done.
3506   <S {Hect}.> I am vnarm'd, forgoe this vantage Greeke.
3507   <S {Achil}.> Strike fellowes, strike, this is the man I seeke.
3508   So Illion fall thou: now Troy sinke downe;
3509   Here lyes thy heart, thy sinewes, and thy bone.
3510   On {Myrmidons}, cry you all #a maine.
3511   {Achilles} hath the mighty {Hector} slaine.  <D {Retreat}.>
3512   Harke, a retreat vpon our Grecian part.
3513  *<S {Gree}.> The Troian Trumpets sounds the like my Lord.
3514  *<S {Achi}.> The dragon wing of night ore- spreds the earth
3515   And stickler- like the Armies seperates
3516   My halfe supt Sword, that frankly would haue fed,
3517   Pleas'd with this dainty bed; thus goes to bed.
3518   Come, tye his body to my horses tayle;
3519   Along the field, I will the Troian traile.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3520   <D {Sound Retreat.  Shout}.>
3521   <D {Enter Agamemnon, Aiax, Menelaus, Nestor},

3523   <S {Aga}.> Harke, harke, what shout is that?
3524   <S {Nest}.> Peace Drums.
      <P YYYY1><C U>
3525   <S {Sold}.> {Achilles, Achilles, Hector}'s slaine, {Achilles}.
3526   <S {Dio}.> The bruite is, {Hector'}s slaine, and by {Achilles}.
3527   <S {Aia}.> If it be so, yet braglesse let it be:
3528   Great {Hector} was a man as good as he.
3529   <S {Agam}.> March patiently along: let one be sent
3530   To pray {Achilles} see vs at our Tent.
3531   If in his death the gods haue vs befrended,
3532   Great Troy is ours, and our sharpe wars are ended.

3536   Neuer goe home; here starue we out the night.
3537   <D {Enter Troylus}.>
3538   <S {Troy}.> {Hector} is slaine.
3539   <S {All}.> {Hector}? the gods forbid.
3540  *<S {Troy}.> Hee's dead: and at the murtherers Horses taile,
3541   In beastly sort, drag'd through the shamefull Field.
3542   Frowne on you heauens, effect your rage with speede:
3543   Sit gods vpon your throanes, and smile at Troy.
3544   I say at once, let your briefe plagues be mercy,
3545   And linger not our sure destructions on.
3546   <S {Aene}.> My Lord, you doe discomfort all the Hoste.
3547   <S {Troy}.> You vnderstand me not, that tell me so:
3548   I doe not speake of flight, of feare, of death,
3549   But dare all imminence that gods and men,
3550   Addresse their dangers in. {Hector} is gone:
3551   Who shall tell {Priam} so? or {Hecuba}?
3552   Let him that will a screechoule aye be call'd,
3553   Goe in to Troy, and say there, {Hector}'s dead:
3554   There is a word will {Priam} turne to stone;
3555   Make wels, and {Niobes} of the maides and wiues;
3556   Coole statues of the youth: and in a word,
3557   Scarre Troy out of it selfe. But march away,
3558   {Hector} is dead: there is no more to say.
3559   Stay yet: you vile abhominable Tents,
3560   Thus proudly pight vpon our Phrygian plaines:
3561   Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
3562  *Ile through, and through you; & thou great siz'd coward:

3564   Ile haunt thee, like a wicked conscience still,
3565   That mouldeth goblins swift as frensies thoughts.
3566   Strike a free march to Troy, with comfort goe:
3567   Hope of reuenge, shall hide our inward woe.

3569   <S {Pand}.> But heare you? heare you?

3578   Full merrily the humble #Bee doth sing,

3580   And being once subdu'd in armed taile,
3581   Sweete hony, and sweete notes together faile.

3587   Brethren and sisters of the hold- dore trade,
3588   Some two months hence, my #will shall here be made:
3589   It should be now, but that my feare is this:
