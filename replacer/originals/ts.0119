2      <D {Enter Begger and Hostes, Christophero Sly}.>
3      <S {Begger}.>
4      Ile pheeze you infaith.
5      <S {Host}.> A paire of stockes you rogue.
6     *<S {Beg}.> Y'are a baggage, the {Slies} are no
7     *Rogues. Looke in the Chronicles, we came
8     *in with {Richard Conqueror}: therefore {Pau-cas}
9      {pallabris}, let the world slide: Sessa.
10    *<S {Host}.> You will not pay for the glasses you haue burst?
11    *<S {Beg}.> No, not a deniere: go by S[aint]. {Ieronimie}, goe to thy
12     cold bed, and warme thee.
13    *<S {Host}.> I know my remedie, I must go fetch the Head- borough.
14    _
15    *<S {Beg}.> Third, or fourth, or fift Borough, Ile answere
16    *him by Law. Ile not budge an inch boy: Let him come,
17     and kindly.  <D {Falles asleepe}.>
18    *<D {Winde hornes. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his traine}.>
19    *<S {Lo}.> Huntsman I charge thee, tender wel my hounds,
20     Brach {Meriman}, the poore Curre is imbost,
21     And couple {Clowder} with the deepe- mouth'd brach,
22     Saw'st thou not boy how {Siluer} made it good
23     At the hedge corner, in the couldest fault,
24     I would not loose the dogge for twentie pound.
25     <S {Hunts}.> Why {Belman} is as good as he my Lord,
26     He cried vpon it at the meerest losse,
27     And twice to day pick'd out the dullest sent,
28     Trust me, I take him for the better dogge.
29     <S {Lord}.> Thou art a Foole, if {Eccho} were as fleete,
30     I would esteeme him worth a dozen such:
31     But sup them well, and looke vnto them all,
32     To morrow I intend to hunt againe.
33     <S {Hunts}.> I will my Lord.
34    *<S {Lord}.> What's heere? One dead, or drunke? See doth
35     he breath?
36    *<S 2.{Hun}.> He breath's my Lord. Were he not warm'd
37     with Ale, this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
38    *<S {Lord}.> Oh monstrous beast, how like a swine he lyes.
39     Grim death, how foule and loathsome is thine image:
40     Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
41     What thinke you, if he were conuey'd to bed,
42     Wrap'd in sweet cloathes: Rings put vpon his fingers:
43     A most delicious banquet by his bed,
44     And braue attendants neere him when he wakes,
45     Would not the begger then forget himselfe?
46    *<S 1.{Hun}.> Beleeue me Lord, I thinke he cannot choose.
47    *<S 2.{H}.> It would seem strange vnto him when he wak'd
48    *<S {Lord}.> Euen as a flatt'ring dreame, or worthles fancie.
49     Then take him vp, and manage well the iest:
50     Carrie him gently to my fairest Chamber,
51     And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
52     Balme his foule head in warme distilled waters,
53     And burne sweet Wood to make the Lodging sweete:
54     Procure me Musicke readie when he wakes,
55     To make a dulcet and a heauenly sound:
56     And if he chance to speake, be readie straight
57     (And with a lowe submissiue reuerence)
58     Say, what is it your Honor wil command:
59     Let one attend him with a siluer Bason
60     Full of Rose- water, and bestrew'd with Flowers,
61     Another beare the Ewer: the third a Diaper,
62     And say #wilt please your Lordship coole your hands.
63     Some one be readie with a costly suite,
64     And aske him what apparrel he will weare:
65     Another tell him of his Hounds and Horse,
66     And that his Ladie mournes at his disease,
67     Perswade him that he hath bin Lunaticke,
68     And when he sayes he is, say that he dreames,
69     For he is nothing but a mightie Lord:
70     This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs,
71     It wil be pastime passing excellent,
72     If it be husbanded with modestie.
73    *<S 1.{Hunts}.> My Lord I warrant you we wil play our part
74     As he shall thinke by our true diligence
75     He is no lesse then what we say he is.
76     <S {Lord}.> Take him vp gently, and to bed with him,
77     And each one to his office when he wakes.
78     <D {Sound trumpets}.>
79     Sirrah, go see what Trumpet 'tis that sounds,
80     Belike some Noble Gentleman that meanes
81     (Trauelling some iourney) to repose him heere.
82     <D {Enter Seruingman}.>
83     How now? who is it?
84     <S {Ser}.> An't please your Honor, Players
85     That offer seruice to your Lordship.
86     <D {Enter Players}.>
87     <S {Lord}.> Bid them come neere:
88     Now fellowes, you are welcome.
89     <S {Players}.> We thanke your Honor.
90     <S {Lord}.> Do you intend to stay with me to night?
91    *<S 2.{Player}.> So please your Lordshippe to accept our
92     dutie.
93     <S {Lord}.> With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
94     Since once he plaide a Farmers eldest sonne,
95     'Twas where you woo'd the Gentlewoman so well:
96     I haue forgot your name:  but sure that part
      <P S3>
97     Was aptly fitted, and naturally perform'd.
98    *<S {Sincklo}.> I thinke 'twas {Soto} that your honor meanes.
99     <S {Lord}.> 'Tis verie true, thou didst it excellent:
100    Well you are come to me in happie time,
101    The rather for I haue some sport in hand,
102    Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
103    There is a Lord will heare you play to night;
104    But I am doubtfull of your modesties,
105    Least (ouer- eying of his odde behauiour,
106    For yet his honor neuer heard a play)
107    You breake into some merrie passion,
108    And so offend him: for I tell you sirs,
109    If you should smile, he growes impatient.
110   *<S {Plai}.> Feare not my Lord, we can contain our selues,
111    Were he the veriest anticke in the world.
112    <S {Lord}.> Go sirra, take them to the Butterie,
113    And giue them friendly welcome euerie one,
114    Let them want nothing that my house affoords.
115    <D {Exit one with the Players}.>
116    Sirra go you to Bartholmew my Page,
117    And see him drest in all suites like a Ladie:
118    That done, conduct him to the drunkards chamber,
119    And call him Madam, do him obeisance:
120    Tell him from me (as he will win my loue)
121    He beare himselfe with honourable action,
122    Such as he hath obseru'd in noble Ladies
123    Vnto their Lords, by them accomplished,
124    Such dutie to the drunkard let him do:
125    With soft lowe tongue, and lowly curtesie,
126    And say: What is't your Honor will command,
127    Wherein your Ladie, and your humble wife,
128    May shew her dutie, and make knowne her loue.
129    And then with kinde embracements, tempting kisses,
130    And with declining head into his bosome
131    Bid him shed teares, as being ouer- ioyed
132    To see her noble Lord restor'd to health,
133    Who for this seuen yeares hath esteemed him
134    No better then a poore and loathsome begger:
135    #And if the boy haue not a womans guift
136    To raine a shower of commanded teares,
137    An Onion wil do well for such a shift,
138    Which in a Napkin (being close conuei'd)
139    Shall in despight enforce a waterie eie:
140    See this dispatch'd with all the #hast thou canst,
141    Anon Ile giue thee more instructions.
142    <D {Exit a seruingman}.>
143    I know the boy will wel vsurpe the grace,
144    Voice, gate, and action of a Gentlewoman:
145    I long to heare him call the drunkard husband,
146    And how my men will stay themselues from laughter,
147    When they do homage to this simple peasant,
148    Ile in to counsell them: haply my presence
149    May well abate the ouer- merrie spleene,
150    Which otherwise would grow into extreames.
151   *<D {Enter aloft the drunkard with attendants, some with apparel},
152    {Bason and Ewer, & other appurtenances, & Lord}.>
153    <S {Beg}.> For Gods sake a pot of small Ale.
154   *<S 1.{Ser}.> #Wilt please your Lord drink a cup of sacke?
155   *<S 2.{Ser}.> #Wilt please your Honor taste of these  Con-serues?
156   _
157    <S 3.{Ser}.> What raiment wil your honor weare to day.
158   *<S {Beg}.> I am {Christophero Sly}, call not mee Honour nor
159   *Lordship: I ne're drank sacke in my life: and if you giue
160   *me any Conserues, giue me conserues of Beefe: nere ask
161   *me what raiment Ile weare, for I haue no more doub-lets
162   *then backes: no more stockings then legges: nor
163   *no more shooes then feet, nay sometime more feete then
164   *shooes, or such shooes as my toes looke through the o-uer- leather.
165   _
166   *<S {Lord}.> Heauen cease this idle humor in your Honor.
167    Oh that a mightie man of such discent,
168    Of such possessions, and so high esteeme
169    Should be infused with so foule a spirit.
170   *<S {Beg}.> What would you make me mad? Am not I {Chri-stopher}
171   *{Slie}, old Slies sonne of Burton- heath, by byrth a
172   *Pedler, by education a Cardmaker, by transmutation a
173   *Beare- heard, and now by present profession a Tinker.
174   *Aske {Marrian Hacket} the fat Alewife of Wincot, if shee
175   *know me not: if she say I am not xiiii.d. on the score for
176   *sheere Ale, score me vp for the lyingst knaue in Christen
177    dome. What I am not bestraught: here's===
178   *<S 3.{Man}.> Oh this it is that makes your Ladie mourne.
179   *<S 2.{Man}.> Oh this is it that makes your seruants droop.
180   *<S {Lord}.> Hence comes it, that your kindred shuns your |(house
181    As beaten hence by your strange Lunacie.
182    Oh Noble Lord, bethinke thee of thy birth,
183    Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
184    And banish hence these abiect lowlie dreames:
185    Looke how thy seruants do attend on thee,
186    Each in his office readie at thy becke.
187   *Wilt thou haue Musicke? Harke Apollo plaies,  <D {Musick}>
188    And twentie caged Nightingales do sing.
189    Or wilt thou sleepe? Wee'l haue thee to a  Couch,
190    Softer and sweeter then the lustfull bed
191    On purpose trim'd vp for Semiramis.
192    Say thou wilt walke: we wil bestrow the ground.
193    Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shal be trap'd,
194    Their harnesse studded all with Gold and Pearle.
195   *Dost thou loue hawking? Thou hast hawkes will soare
196    Aboue the morning Larke. Or wilt thou hunt,
197    Thy hounds shall make the Welkin answer them
198    And fetch shrill ecchoes from the hollow earth.
199   *<S 1.{Man}.> Say thou wilt course, thy gray- hounds are as |(swift
200    As breathed Stags: #I fleeter then the Roe.
201   *<S 2.{M}.> Dost thou loue pictures? we wil fetch thee strait
202    Adonis painted by a running brooke,
203    And Citherea all in sedges hid,
204    Which seeme to moue and wanton with her breath,
205    Euen as the wauing sedges play with winde.
206    <S {Lord}.> Wee'l shew thee {Io}, as she was a Maid,
207    And how she was beguiled and surpriz'd,
208    As liuelie painted, as the deede was done.
209   *<S 3.{Man}.> Or {Daphne} roming through a thornie wood,
210    Scratching her legs, that one shal sweare she bleeds,
211    And at that sight shal sad Apollo weepe,
212    So workmanlie the blood and teares are drawne.
213    <S {Lord}.> Thou art a Lord, and nothing but a Lord:
214    Thou hast a Ladie farre more Beautifull,
215    Then any woman in this waining age.
216   *<S 1.{Man}.> And til the teares that she hath shed for thee,
217    Like enuious flouds ore- run her louely face,
218    She was the fairest creature in the world,
219    And yet shee is inferiour to none.
220    <S {Beg}.> Am I a Lord, and haue I such a Ladie?
221    Or do I dreame? Or haue I dream'd till now?
222    I do not sleepe: I see, I heare, I speake:
223    I smel sweet sauours, and I feele soft things:
224    Vpon my life I am a Lord indeede,
225    And not a  Tinker, nor Christopher Slie.
226    Well, bring our Ladie hither to our sight,
227    And  once againe a pot o'th smallest Ale.
      <P S3v>
228   *<S 2.{Man}.> #Wilt please your mightinesse to wash your
229    hands:
230    Oh how we ioy to see your wit restor'd,
231    Oh that once more you knew but what you are:
232    These fifteene yeeres you haue bin in a dreame,
233    Or when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
234   *<S {Beg}.> These fifteene yeeres, by my fay, a goodly nap,
235    But did I neuer speake of all that time.
236    <S 1.{Man}.> Oh yes my Lord, but verie idle words,
237    For though you lay heere in this goodlie chamber,
238    Yet would you say, ye were beaten out of doore,
239    And raile vpon the Hostesse of the house,
240    And say you would present her at the Leete,
241    Because she brought stone- Iugs, and no seal'd quarts:
242    Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
243    <S {Beg}.> #I, the womans maide of the house.
244   *<S 3.{Man}.> Why sir you know no house, nor no such maid
245    Nor no such men as you haue reckon'd vp,
246    As {Stephen Slie}, and old {Iohn Naps} of Greece,
247    And {Peter Turph}, and {Henry Pimpernell},
248    And twentie more such names and men as these,
249    Which neuer were, nor no man euer saw.
250    <S {Beg}.> Now Lord be thanked for my good amends.
251    <S {All}.> Amen.
252    <D {Enter Lady with Attendants}.>
253    <S {Beg}.> I thanke thee, thou shalt not loose by it.
254    <S {Lady}.> How fares my noble Lord?
255    <S {Beg}.> Marrie I fare well, for heere is cheere enough.
256    Where is my wife?
257    <S {La}.> Heere noble Lord, what is thy #will with her?
258   *<S {Beg}.> Are you my wife, and will not cal me husband?
259    My men should call me Lord, I am your good- man.
260   *<S {La}.> My husband and my Lord, my Lord and husband
261    I am your wife in all obedience.
262    <S {Beg}.> I know it well, what must I call her?
263    <S {Lord}.> Madam.
264    <S {Beg}.> {Alce} Madam, or {Ione} Madam?
265   *<S {Lord}.> Madam, and nothing else, so Lords cal Ladies
266    <S {Beg}.> Madame wife, they say that I haue dream'd,
267    And slept aboue some fifteene yeare or more.
268    <S {Lady}.> #I, and the time seeme's thirty vnto me,
269    Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
270    <S {Beg}.> 'Tis much, seruants leaue me and her alone:
271    Madam vndresse you, and come now to bed.
272    <S {La}.> Thrice noble Lord, let me intreat of you
273    To pardon me yet for a night or two:
274    Or if not so, vntill the Sun be set.
275    For your Physitians haue expressely charg'd,
276    In perill to incurre your former malady,
277    That I should yet absent me from your bed:
278    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
279    <S {Beg}.> #I, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long:
280   *But I would be loth to fall into my dreames againe: I
281   *wil therefore tarrie in despight of the flesh & the blood
282    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
283   *<S {Mes}.> Your Honors Players hearing your amendment,
284    Are come  to play a pleasant Comedie,
285    For so your doctors hold it very meete,
286    Seeing too much sadnesse hath congeal'd your blood,
287    And melancholly is the Nurse of frenzie,
288    Therefore they thought it good you heare a play,
289    And frame your minde to mirth and merriment,
290    Which barres a thousand harmes, and lengthens life.
291   *<S {Beg}.> Marrie I will let them play, it is not a Comon-tie,
292    a Christmas gambold, or a tumbling tricke?
293    <S {Lady}.> No my good Lord, it is more pleasing stuffe.
294    <S {Beg}.> What, houshold stuffe.
295    <S {Lady}.> It is a kinde of history.
296    <S {Beg}.> Well, #we'l see't:
297    Come Madam wife sit by my side,
298    And let the world slip, we shall nere be yonger.
299    <D {Flourish. Enter Lucentio, and his man Triano}.>
300    <S {Luc}.> {Tranio},  since for the great desire I had
301    To see faire {Padua},  nurserie of Arts,
302    I am arriu'd for fruitfull {Lumbardie},
303    The pleasant garden of great {Italy},
304    And by my fathers loue and leaue am arm'd
305    With his good #will,  and thy good companie.
306    My trustie seruant well approu'd in all,
307    Heere let vs breath, and haply institute
308    A course of Learning, and ingenious studies.
309    {Pisa}  renowned for graue Citizens
310    Gaue me my #being, and my father first
311    A Merchant of great Trafficke through the world:
312    {Vincentio's} come of the {Bentiuolij},
313    {Vincentio's} sonne, brought vp in {Florence},
314    It shall become to serue all hopes conceiu'd
315    To decke his fortune with his vertuous deedes:
316    And therefore {Tranio}, for the time I studie,
317    Vertue and that part of Philosophie
318    Will I applie, that treats of happinesse,
319    By vertue specially to be atchieu'd.
320    Tell me thy minde, for I haue {Pisa} left,
321    And am to {Padua} come, as he that leaues
322    A shallow plash, to plunge him in the deepe,
323    And with sacietie seekes to quench his thirst.
324    <S {Tra}.> {Me Pardonato},  gentle master mine:
325    I am in all affected as your selfe,
326    Glad that you thus continue your resolue,
327    To sucke the sweets of sweete Philosophie.
328    Onely (good master) while we do admire
329    This vertue, and this morall discipline,
330    Let's be no Stoickes, nor no stockes I pray,
331    Or so deuote to {Aristotles} checkes
332    As {Ouid}; be an out- cast quite abiur'd:
333    Balke Lodgicke with acquaintance that you haue,
334    And practise Rhetoricke in your common talke,
335    Musicke and Poesie vse, to quicken you,
336    The Mathematickes, and the Metaphysickes
337    Fall to them as you finde your stomacke serues you:
338    No profit growes, where is no pleasure tane:
339    In briefe sir, studie what you most affect.
340    <S {Luc}.>  Gramercies {Tranio}, well dost thou aduise,
341    If {Biondello}  thou wert come ashore,
342    We could at once put vs in readinesse,
343    And take a Lodging fit to entertaine
344    Such friends (as time) in {Padua}  shall beget.
345    But stay #a while, what companie is this?
346    <S {Tra}.>  Master some shew to welcome vs to Towne.
347   *<D {Enter  Baptista with his two daughters, Katerina & Bianca},
348    {#Gremio a Pantelowne, Hortentio sister to Bianca}.
349    {Lucen. Tranio, stand by}.>
350    <S {Bap}.>  Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
351    For how I firmly am resolu'd you know:
352    That is, not to bestow my yongest daughter,
353    Before I haue a husband for the elder:
354    If either of you both loue {Katherina},
      <P S4>
355    Because I know you well, and loue you well,
356    Leaue shall you haue to court her at your pleasure.
357    <S {Gre}.>  To cart her rather. She's #to  rough for mee,
358    There, there {Hortensio}, will you any Wife?
359    <S {Kate}.> I pray you sir, is it your #will
360    To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
361    <S {Hor}.> Mates maid, how meane you that?
362    No mates for you,
363    Vnlesse you were of gentler milder mould.
364    <S {Kate}.> I'faith sir, you shall neuer neede to feare,
365    I-wis it is not halfe way to her heart:
366    But if it were, doubt not, her care should be,
367    To combe your noddle with a three- legg'd stoole,
368    And paint your face, and vse you like a foole.
369    <S {Hor}.>  From all such diuels, good Lord deliuer vs.
370    <S {Gre}.> And me too, good Lord.
371   *<S {Tra}.> Husht master, heres some good pastime toward;
372    That wench is starke mad, or wonderfull froward.
373    <S {Lucen}.>  But in the others silence do I see,
374    Maids milde behauiour and sobrietie.
375    Peace {Tranio}.
376    <S {Tra}.> Well said Mr, mum, and gaze your fill.
377    <S {Bap}.>  Gentlemen, that I may soone make good
378    What I haue said, {Bianca}  get you in,
379    And let it not displease thee good {Bianca},
380    For I will loue thee nere the lesse my girle.
381   *<S {Kate}.> A pretty peate, it is best put finger in the eye,
382    #and she knew why.
383    <S {Bian}.>  Sister content you, in my discontent.
384    Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
385    My bookes and instruments shall be my companie,
386    On them to looke, and practise by my selfe.
387   *<S {Luc}.> Harke {Tranio}, thou maist heare {Minerua} speak.
388    <S {Hor}.> Signior {Baptista}, will you be so strange,
389    Sorrie am I that our good #will effects
390    {Bianca's} greefe.
391    <S {Gre}.>  Why will you mew her vp
392    (Signior {Baptista}) for this fiend of #hell,
393    And make her beare the pennance of her tongue.
394    <S {Bap}.>  Gentlemen content ye: I am resolud:
395    Go in {Bianca}.
396    And for I know she taketh most delight
397    In Musicke, Instruments, and Poetry,
398    Schoolemasters will I keepe within my house,
399    Fit to instruct her youth. If you {Hortensio},
400    Or signior {Gremio} you know any such,
401    Preferre them hither: for to cunning men,
402    I will be very kinde and liberall,
403    To mine owne children, in good bringing vp,
404    And so farewell: {Katherina}  you may stay,
405    For I haue more to commune with {Bianca}.  <D {Exit}.>
406    <S {Kate}.>  Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
407    What shall I be appointed houres, as though
408    (Belike) I knew not what to take,
409    And what to leaue? Ha.  <D {Exit}>
410   *<S {Gre}.> You may go to the diuels dam: your guifts are
411   *so  good heere's none will holde you: Their loue is not
412   *so  great {Hortensio},  but we may blow our nails together,
413   *and  fast it fairely out. Our cakes dough on both sides.
414   *Farewell:  yet for the loue I beare my sweet {Bianca}, if
415   *I can by any meanes light on a fit man to teach her that
416    wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
417   *<S {Hor}.> So will I signiour {Gremio}: but a word I pray:
418   *Though  the nature of our quarrell yet neuer brook'd
419   *parle,  know now vpon aduice, it toucheth vs both: that
420   *we  may yet againe haue accesse to our faire Mistris, and
421   *be happie riuals in {Bianca's} loue, to labour and effect
422    one thing specially.
423    <S {Gre}.>  What's that I pray?
424    <S {Hor}.> Marrie sir to get a husband for her Sister.
425    <S {Gre}.> A husband: a diuell.
426    <S {Hor}.> I say a husband.
427   *<S {Gre}.> I say, a diuell: Think'st thou {Hortensio}, though
428   *her  father be verie rich, any man is so verie a foole to be
429    married to  #hell?
430   *<S {Hor}.> Tush {Gremio}: though it passe your patience &
431   *mine  to endure her lowd alarums, why man there bee
432   *good fellowes in the world, #and a man could light on
433   *them,  would take her with all faults, and mony enough.
434   *<S {Gre}.> I cannot tell: but I had as lief take her dowrie
435   *with this condition; To be whipt at the hie crosse euerie
436    morning.
437   *<S {Hor}.>  Faith (as you say) there's small choise in rotten
438   *apples: but come, since this bar in law makes vs friends,
439   *it  shall be so farre forth friendly maintain'd, till by hel-ping
440   *{Baptistas}  eldest daughter to a husband, wee set his
441   *yongest  free for a husband, and then haue too't afresh:
442   *Sweet  {Bianca}, happy man be his dole: hee that runnes
443    fastest, gets the Ring: How say you signior {Gremio}?
444   *<S {Grem}.> I am agreed, and would I had giuen him the
445   *best horse in {Padua} to begin his woing that would tho-roughly
446   *woe  her, wed her, and bed her, and ridde the
447    house of her. Come on.
448    <D {Exeunt ambo. Manet Tranio and Lucentio}>
449    <S {Tra}.>  I pray sir tel me, is it possible
450    That loue should of a sodaine take such hold.
451    <S {Luc}.> Oh {Tranio}, till I found it to be true,
452    I neuer thought it possible or likely.
453    But see, while idely I stood looking on,
454    I found the effect of Loue in idlenesse,
455    And now in plainnesse do confesse to thee
456    That art to me as secret and as deere
457    As {Anna}  to the Queene of Carthage was:
458    {#Tranio}  I burne, I pine, I perish {Tranio},
459    If I atchieue not this yong modest gyrle:
460    Counsaile me {Tranio},  for I know thou canst:
461    Assist me {Tranio},  for I know thou wilt.
462    <S {Tra}.>  Master, it is no time to chide you now,
463    Affection is not rated from the heart:
464    If loue haue touch'd you, naught remaines but so,
465    {Redime te captam quam queas minimo}.
466    <S {Luc}.>  Gramercies Lad: Go forward, this contents,
467    The rest wil comfort, for thy counsels sound.
468    <S {Tra}.>  Master, you look'd so longly on the maide,
469    Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
470    <S {Luc}.>  Oh yes, I saw sweet beautie in her face,
471    Such as the daughter of {Agenor}  had,
472    That made great {Ioue}  to humble him to her hand,
473    When with his knees he kist the Cretan strond.
474   *<S {Tra}.> Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how hir sister
475    Began to scold, and raise vp such a storme,
476    That mortal eares might hardly indure the din.
477    <S {Luc}.> {Tranio}, I saw her corrall lips to moue,
478    And with her breath she did perfume the ayre,
479    Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
480   *<S {Tra}.>  Nay, then 'tis time to stirre him fro[m] his trance:
481    I pray awake sir: if you loue the Maide,
482   *Bend  thoughts and wits to atcheeue her. Thus it stands:
483    Her elder sister is so curst and shrew'd,
484    That til the Father rid his hands of her,
485    Master, your Loue must liue a maide at home,
486    And therefore has he closely meu'd her vp,
      <P S4v>
487    Because she will not be annoy'd with suters.
488    <S {Luc}.> Ah {Tranio}, what a cruell Fathers he:
489    But art thou not aduis'd, he tooke some care
490    To get her cunning Schoolemasters to instruct her.
491    <S {Tra}.>  #I  marry am I sir, and now 'tis plotted.
492    <S {Luc}.> I haue it {Tranio}.
493    <S {Tra}.> Master, for my hand,
494    Both our inuentions meet and iumpe in one.
495    <S {Luc}.> Tell me thine first.
496    <S {Tra}.>  You will be schoole- master,
497    And vndertake the teaching of the maid:
498    That's your deuice.
499    <S {Luc}.> It is: May it be done?
500    <S {Tra}.>  Not possible: for who shall beare your part,
501    And be in {Padua} heere {Vincentio's} sonne,
502    Keepe house, and ply his booke, welcome his friends,
503    Visit his Countrimen, and banquet them?
504    <S {Luc}.> {Basta}, content thee:  for I haue it full.
505    We haue not yet bin seene in any house,
506    Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces,
507    For man or master: then it followes thus;
508    Thou shalt be master,  {Tranio} in my sted:
509    Keepe house, and port, and seruants, as I should,
510    I will some other be, some {Florentine},
511    Some {Neapolitan},  or meaner man of {Pisa}.
512    'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so: {Tranio}  at once
513    Vncase thee: take my Coulord hat and cloake,
514    When {Biondello}  comes, he waites on thee,
515    But I will charme him first to keepe his tongue.
516    <S {Tra}.>  So had you neede:
517    In breefe Sir, sith it your pleasure is,
518    And I am tyed to be obedient,
519    For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
520    Be seruiceable to my sonne (quoth he)
521    Although I thinke 'twas in another sense,
522    I am content to bee {Lucentio},
523    Because so well I loue {Lucentio}.
524    <S {Luc}.> {Tranio} be so, because {Lucentio} loues,
525    And let me be a slaue, t' atchieue that maide,
526    Whose sodaine sight hath thral'd my wounded eye.
527    <D {Enter Biondello}.>
528    Heere comes the rogue. Sirra, where haue you bin?
529   *<S {Bion}.>  Where haue I beene? Nay how now, where
530   *are  you? Maister, ha's my fellow {Tranio} stolne your
531   *cloathes,  or you stolne his, or both? Pray what's the
532    newes?
533    <S {Luc}.> Sirra come hither, 'tis no time to iest,
534    And therefore frame your manners to the time
535    Your fellow {Tranio}  heere to saue my life,
536    Puts my apparrell, and my count'nance on,
537    And I for my escape haue put on his:
538    For in a quarrell since I came a- shore,
539    I kil'd a man, and feare I was descried:
540    Waite you on him, I charge you, as becomes:
541    While I make way from hence to saue my life:
542    You vnderstand me?
543    <S {Bion}.> #I sir, ne're a whit.
544    <S {Luc}.> And not a iot of {Tranio}  in your mouth,
545    {#Tranio}  is chang'd into {Lucentio}.
546    <S {Bion}.> The better for him, would I were so too.
547   *<S {Tra}.>  So could I 'faith boy, to haue the next wish af-ter,
548   *that  {Lucentio} indeede had {Baptistas} yongest daugh-ter.
549   *But  sirra, not for my sake, but your masters, I ad-uise
550   *you  vse your manners discreetly in all kind of com-panies:
551   *When  I am alone, why then I am {Tranio}:  but in
552    all places else, your master {Lucentio}.
553    <S {Luc}.> {Tranio} let's go:
554    One thing more rests, that thy selfe execute,
555   *To  make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,
556    Sufficeth my reasons are both good and waighty.
557    <D {Exeunt. The Presenters aboue speakes}.>
558   *<S 1.{Man}.> My Lord you nod, you do not minde the
559    play.
560   *<S {Beg}.> Yes by Saint Anne do I, a good matter surely:
561    Comes there any more of it?
562    <S {Lady}.>  My Lord, 'tis but begun.
563   *<S {Beg}.> 'Tis a verie excellent peece of worke, Madame
564    Ladie: would 'twere done.  <D {They sit and marke}.>
565    <D {Enter Petruchio, and his man Grumio}.>
566    <S {Petr}.> {Verona}, for #a while I take my leaue,
567    To see my friends in {Padua};  but of all
568    My best beloued and approued friend
569    {Hortensio}: & I trow this is his house:
570    Heere sirra {Grumio}, knocke I say.
571   *<S {Gru}.> Knocke sir? whom should I knocke? Is there
572    any man ha's rebus'd your worship?
573    <S {Petr}.> Villaine I say, knocke me heere soundly.
574   *<S {Gru}.> Knocke you heere sir? Why sir, what am I sir,
575    that I should knocke you heere sir.
576    <S {Petr}.> Villaine I say, knocke me at this gate,
577    And rap me well, or Ile knocke your knaues pate.
578    <S {Gru}.> My Mr is growne quarrelsome:
579    I should knocke you first,
580    And then I know after who comes by the worst.
581    <S {Petr}.> Will it not be?
582    'Faith sirrah, #and you'l not knocke, Ile ring it,
583    Ile trie how you can {Sol}, {Fa},  and sing it.
584    <D {He rings him by the eares}>
585    <S {Gru}.>  Helpe mistris helpe, my master is mad.
586    <S {Petr}.> Now knocke when I bid you: sirrah villaine.
587    <D {Enter Hortensio}.>
588   *<S {Hor}.> How now, what's the matter? My olde friend
589   *{#Grumio}, and my good friend {Petruchio}? How do you all
590    at {Verona}?
591   *<S {Petr}.>  Signior {Hortensio}, come you to part the fray?
592    {Contutti le core #bene  trobatto}, may I say.
593   *<S {Hor}.> {Alla nostra casa #bene venuto multo honorata signi-or}
594    {mio Petruchio}.
595    Rise {Grumio} rise, we will compound this quarrell.
596   *<S {Gru}.>  Nay 'tis no matter sir, what he leges in Latine.
597   *If this be not a lawfull cause for me to leaue his seruice,
598   *looke you sir: He bid me knocke him, & rap him sound-ly
599   *sir. Well, was it fit for a seruant to vse his master so,
600   *being  perhaps (for ought I see) two and thirty, a peepe
601   *out?  Whom would to God I had well knockt at first,
602    then had not {Grumio}  come by the worst.
603    <S {Petr}.> A sencelesse villaine: good {Hortensio},
604    I bad the rascall knocke vpon your gate,
605    And could not get him for my heart to do it.
606   *<S {Gru}.>  Knocke at the gate? O heauens: spake you not
607   *these  words plaine? Sirra, Knocke me heere: rappe me
608   *heere:  knocke me well, and knocke me soundly? And
609    come you now with knocking at the gate?
610    <S {Petr}.> Sirra be gone, or talke not I aduise you.
611    <S {Hor}.> {Petruchio} patience, I am {Grumio's} pledge:
612    Why #this a heauie chance twixt him and you,
613    Your ancient trustie pleasant seruant {Grumio}:
614    And tell me now (sweet friend) what happie gale
615    Blowes you to {Padua}  heere, from old {Verona}?
616   *<S {Petr}.>  Such wind as scatters yongmen throgh y world,
      <P S5>
617    To seeke their fortunes farther then at home,
618    Where small experience growes but in a few.
619    Signior {Hortensio}, thus it stands with me,
620    {Antonio} my father is deceast,
621    And I haue thrust my selfe into this maze,
622    Happily to wiue and thriue, as best I may:
623    Crownes in my purse I haue, and goods at home,
624    And so am come abroad to see the world.
625    <S {Hor}.> {Petruchio},  shall I then come roundly to thee,
626    And wish thee to a shrew'd ill- fauour'd wife?
627    Thou'dst thanke me but a little for my counsell:
628    And yet Ile promise thee she shall be rich,
629    And verie rich: but th'art too much my friend,
630    And Ile not wish thee to her.
631    <S {Petr}.>  Signior {Hortensio}, 'twixt such friends as wee,
632    Few words suffice: and therefore, if thou know
633    One rich enough to be {Petruchio's} wife:
634    (As wealth is burthen of my woing dance)
635    Be she as foule as was {Florentius} Loue,
636    As old as {Sibell}, and as curst and shrow'd
637    As {Socrates Zentippe},  or a worse:
638    She moues me not, or not remoues at least
639    Affections edge in me. Were she is as rough
640    As are the swelling {Adriaticke} seas.
641    I come to wiue it wealthily in {Padua}:
642    If wealthily, then happily in {Padua}.
643   *<S {Gru}.>  Nay looke you sir, hee tels you flatly what his
644   *minde  is: why giue him Gold enough, and marrie him
645   *to  a Puppet or an Aglet babie, or an old trot with ne're a
646   *tooth  in her head, though she haue as manie diseases as
647   *two  and fiftie horses. Why nothing comes amisse, so
648    monie comes withall.
649    <S {Hor}.> {Petruchio}, since we are stept thus farre in,
650    I will continue that I broach'd in iest,
651    I can {Petruchio} helpe thee to a wife
652    With wealth enough, and yong and beautious,
653    Brought vp as best becomes a Gentlewoman.
654    Her onely fault, and that is faults enough,
655    Is, that she is intollerable curst,
656    And shrow'd, and froward, so beyond all measure,
657    That were my state farre worser then it is,
658    I would not wed her for a #mine of Gold.
659   *<S {Petr}.>  {Hortensio} peace: thou knowst not golds effect,
660    Tell me her fathers name, and 'tis enough:
661    For I will boord her, though she chide as loud
662    As thunder, when the clouds in Autumne cracke.
663    <S {Hor}.>  Her father is {Baptista Minola},
664    An affable and courteous Gentleman,
665    Her name is {Katherina Minola},
666    Renown'd in {Padua} for her scolding tongue.
667    <S {Petr}.> I know her father, though I know not her,
668    And he knew my deceased father well:
669    I wil not sleepe {Hortensio} til I see her,
670    And therefore let me be thus bold with you,
671    To giue you ouer at this first encounter,
672    Vnlesse you wil accompanie me thither.
673   *<S {Gru}>. I pray you Sir let him go while the humor lasts.
674   *#A  my word, #and she knew him as wel as I do, she would
675   *thinke  scolding would doe little good vpon him. Shee
676   *may  perhaps call him halfe a score Knaues, or so: Why
677   *that's  nothing;  #and he begin once, hee'l raile in his rope
678   *trickes.  Ile tell you what sir, #and she stand him but a li-tle,
679   *he  wil throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure hir
680   *with  it, that shee shal haue no more eies to see withall
681    then a Cat: you know him not sir.
682    <S {Hor}.>  Tarrie {Petruchio}, I must go with thee,
683    For in {Baptistas} keepe my treasure is:
684    He hath the Iewel of my life in hold,
685    His yongest daughter, beautiful {Bianca},
686    And her with- holds  from me. Other more
687    Suters to her, and riuals in my Loue:
688    Supposing it a thing impossible,
689    For those defects I haue before rehearst,
690    That euer {Katherina}  wil be woo'd:
691    Therefore this order hath {Baptista} tane,
692    That none shal haue accesse vnto {Bianca},
693    Til {Katherine} the Curst, haue got a husband.
694    <S {Gru}.> {Katherine} the curst,
695    A title for a maide, of all titles the worst.
696    <S {Hor}.> Now shal my friend {Petruchio} do me grace,
697    And offer me disguis'd in sober robes,
698    To old {Baptista} as a schoole- master
699    Well seene in Musicke, to instruct {Bianca},
700    That so I may by this deuice at least
701    Haue leaue and leisure to make loue to her,
702    And vnsuspected court her by her selfe.
703    <D {Enter Gremio and Lucentio disguised}.>
704   *<S {Gru}.>  Heere's no knauerie. See, to beguile the olde- folkes,
705   *how  the young folkes lay their heads together.
706   *Master,  master, looke about you: Who goes there? ha.
707    <S {Hor}.>  Peace {Grumio},  it is the riuall of my Loue.
708    {Petruchio} stand by #a while.
709    <S {Grumio}.>  A proper stripling, and an amorous.
710    <S {Gremio}.> O very well, I haue perus'd the note:
711    Hearke you sir, Ile haue them verie fairely bound,
712    All bookes of Loue, see that at any hand,
713    And see you reade no other Lectures to her:
714    You vnderstand me. Ouer and beside
715    Signior {Baptistas} liberalitie,
716    Ile mend it with a Largesse. Take your paper too,
717    And let me haue them verie wel perfum'd;
718    For she is sweeter then perfume it selfe
719    To whom they go to: what wil you reade to her.
720    <S {Luc}.> What ere I reade to her, Ile pleade for you,
721    As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
722    As firmely as your selfe were still in place,
723    Yea and perhaps with more successefull words
724    Then you;  vnlesse you were a scholler sir.
725    <S {Gre}.> Oh this learning, what a thing it is.
726    <S {Gru}.> Oh this Woodcocke, what an Asse it is.
727    <S {Petru}.> Peace sirra.
728    <S {Hor}.> {Grumio} mum: God saue you signior {Gremio}.
729    <S {Gre}.> And you are wel met, Signior {Hortensio}.
730    Trow you whither I am going? To {Baptista Minola},
731    I promist to enquire carefully
732    About a schoolemaster for the faire {Bianca},
733    And by good fortune I haue lighted well
734    On this yong man: For learning and behauiour
735    Fit for her turne, well read in Poetrie
736    And other bookes, good ones, I warrant ye.
737    <S {Hor}.>  'Tis well: and I haue met a Gentleman
738    Hath promist me to helpe one to another,
739    A fine Musitian to instruct our Mistris,
740    So shal I no whit be behinde in dutie
741    To faire {Bianca}, so beloued of me.
742    <S {Gre}.> Beloued of me, and that my deeds shal proue.
743    <S {Gru}.> And that his bags shal proue.
744    <S {Hor}.> {Gremio}, 'tis now no time to vent our loue,
745    Listen to me, and if you speake me faire,
746    Ile tel you newes indifferent good for either.
747    Heere is a Gentleman whom by chance I met
      <P S5v>
748    Vpon agreement from vs to his liking,
749    Will vndertake to woo curst {Katherine},
750    Yea, and to marrie her, if her dowrie please.
751    <S {Gre}.> So said, so done, is well:
752    {Hortensio}, haue you told him all her faults?
753    <S {Petr}.> I know she is an irkesome brawling scold:
754    If that be all Masters, I heare no harme.
755    <S {Gre}.> No, sayst me so, friend? What Countreyman?
756    <S {Petr}.> Borne in {Verona}, old {Butonios} sonne:
757    My father dead, my fortune liues for me,
758    And I do hope, good dayes and long, to see.
759   *<S {Gre}.>  Oh sir, such a life with such a wife, were strange:
760    But if you haue a stomacke, too't #a Gods name,
761    You shal haue me assisting you in all.
762    But will you woo this Wilde- cat?
763    <S {Petr}.> Will I liue?
764    <S {Gru}.> Wil he woo her? #I: or Ile hang her.
765    <S {Petr}.> Why came I hither, but to that intent?
766    Thinke you, a little dinne can daunt mine eares?
767    Haue I not in my time heard Lions rore?
768    Haue I not heard the sea, puft vp with windes,
769    Rage like an angry Boare, chafed with sweat?
770    Haue I not heard great Ordnance in the field?
771    And heauens Artillerie thunder in the skies?
772    Haue I not in a pitched battell heard
773    Loud larums, neighing steeds, & trumpets clangue?
774    And do you tell me of a womans tongue?
775    That giues not halfe so great a blow to heare,
776    As wil a Chesse- nut in a Farmers fire.
777    Tush, tush, feare boyes with bugs.
778    <S {Gru}.> For he feares none.
779    <S {Grem}.> {Hortensio}  hearke:
780    This Gentleman is happily arriu'd,
781    My minde presumes for his owne good, and yours.
782    <S {Hor}.> I promist we would be Contributors,
783    And beare his charge of wooing whatsoere.
784    <S {Gremio}.> And so we wil, prouided that he win her.
785    <S {Gru}.> I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
786    <D {Enter Tranio braue, and Biondello}.>
787    <S {Tra}.> Gentlemen God saue you. If I may be bold
788    Tell me I beseech you, which is the readiest way
789    To the house of Signior {Baptista Minola}?
790   *<S {Bion}.>  He that ha's the two faire daughters: ist he you
791    meane?
792    <S {Tra}.> Euen he {Biondello}.
793    <S {Gre}.> Hearke you sir, you meane not her to===
794    <S {Tra}.> Perhaps him and her sir, what haue you to do?
795    <S {Petr}.> Not her that chides sir, at any hand I pray.
796    <S {Tranio}.> I loue no chiders sir: {Biondello}, let's away.
797    <S {Luc}.> Well begun {Tranio}.
798    <S {Hor}.> Sir, a word ere you go:
799    Are you a sutor to the Maid you talke of, yea or no?
800    <S {Tra}.> And if I be sir, is it any offence?
801   *<S {Gremio}.>  No: if without more words you will get you
802    hence.
803    <S {Tra}.> Why sir, I pray are not the streets as free
804    For me, as for you?
805    <S {Gre}.> But so is not she.
806    <S {Tra}.> For what reason I beseech you.
807    <S {Gre}.> For this reason if you'l kno,
808    That she's the choise loue of Signior {Gremio}.
809    <S {Hor}.> That she's the chosen of signior {Hortensio}.
810    <S {Tra}.> Softly my Masters: If you be Gentlemen
811    Do me this right: heare me with patience.
812    {Baptista} is a noble Gentleman,
813    To whom my Father is not all vnknowne,
814    And were his daughter fairer then she is,
815    She may more sutors haue, and me for one.
816    Faire {Laedaes}  daughter had a thousand wooers,
817    Then well one more may faire {Bianca} haue;
818    And so she shall: {Lucentio}  shal make one,
819    Though {Paris}  came, in hope to speed alone.
820    <S {Gre}.> What, this Gentleman will out- talke vs all.
821    <S {Luc}.>  Sir giue him head, I know hee'l proue a Iade.
822    <S {Petr}.> {Hortensio}, to what end are all these words?
823    <S {Hor}.> Sir, let me be so bold as aske you,
824    Did you yet euer see {Baptistas}  daughter?
825    <S {Tra}.> No sir, but heare I do that he hath two:
826    The one, as famous for a scolding tongue,
827    As is the other, for beauteous modestie.
828    <S {Petr}.> Sir, sir, the first's for me, let her go by.
829    <S {Gre}.> Yea, leaue that labour to great {Hercules},
830    And let it be more then {Alcides} twelue.
831    <S {Petr}.> Sir vnderstand you this of me (insooth)
832    The yongest daughter whom you hearken for,
833    Her father keepes from all accesse of sutors,
834    And will not promise her to any man,
835    Vntill the elder sister first be wed.
836    The yonger then is free, and not before.
837    <S {Tranio}.> If it be so sir, that you are the man
838    Must steed vs all, and me amongst the rest:
839    And if you breake the ice, and do this seeke,
840    Atchieue the elder: set the yonger free,
841    For our accesse, whose hap shall be to haue her,
842    Wil not so gracelesse be, to be ingrate.
843    <S {Hor}.> Sir you say wel, and wel you do conceiue,
844    And since you do professe to be a sutor,
845    You must as we do, gratifie this Gentleman,
846    To whom we all rest generally beholding.
847    <S {Tranio}.> Sir, I shal not be slacke, in signe whereof,
848    Please ye we may contriue this afternoone,
849    And quaffe carowses to our Mistresse health,
850    And do as aduersaries do in law,
851    Striue mightily, but eate and drinke as friends.
852   *<S {Gru}. {Bion}.>   Oh excellent motion: fellowes let's be gon.
853    <S {Hor}.> The motions good indeed, and be it so,
854    {Petruchio}, I shal be your {#Been venuto}.  <D {Exeunt}>.
855    <D {Enter Katherina and Bianca}.>
856   *<S {Bian}.>  Good sister wrong me not, nor wrong your self,
857    To make a bondmaide and a slaue of mee,
858    That I disdaine: but for these other goods,
859    Vnbinde my hands, Ile pull them off my selfe,
860    Yea all my raiment, to my petticoate,
861    Or what you will command me, wil I do,
862    So well I know my dutie to my elders.
863    <S {Kate}.> Of all thy sutors heere I charge tel
864    Whom thou lou'st best: see thou dissemble not.
865    <S {Bianca}.> Beleeue me sister, of all the men aliue,
866    I neuer yet beheld that speciall face,
867    Which I could fancie, more then any other.
868    <S {Kate}.> Minion thou lyest: Is't not {Hortensio}?
869    <S {Bian}.> If you affect him sister, heere I sweare
870    Ile pleade for you my selfe, but you shal haue him.
871    <S {Kate}.> Oh then belike you fancie riches more,
872    You wil haue {Gremio} to keepe you faire.
873    <S {Bian}.> Is it for him you do enuie me so?
874    Nay then you iest, and now I wel perceiue
875    You haue but iested with me all this while:
876    I prethee sister Kate, vntie my hands.
877   *<S {Ka}.>  If that be iest, then all the rest was so.  <D {Strikes her}>
      <P S6>
878    <D {Enter Baptista}.>
879   *<S {Bap}.>  Why how now Dame, whence growes this in-solence?
880   _
881    {#Bianca} stand aside, poore gyrle she weepes:
882    Go ply thy Needle, meddle not with her.
883    For shame thou Hilding of a diuellish spirit,
884    Why dost thou wrong her, that did nere wrong thee?
885    When did she crosse thee with a bitter word?
886    <S {Kate}.> Her silence flouts me, and Ile be reueng'd.
887    <D {Flies after Bianca}>
888    <S {Bap}.> What in my sight? {Bianca} get thee in.  <D {Exit}.>
889    <S {Kate}.> What will you not suffer me: Nay now I see
890    She is your treasure, she must haue a husband,
891    I must dance bare- foot on her wedding day,
892    And for your loue to her, leade Apes in #hell.
893    Talke not to me, I will go sit and weepe,
894    Till I can finde occasion of reuenge.
895    <S {Bap}.>  Was euer Gentleman thus greeu'd as I?
896    But who comes heere.
897    <D {Enter Gremio, Lucentio, in the habit of a meane man},
898    {Petruchio with Tranio, with his boy}
899    {bearing a Lute and Bookes}.>
900    <S {Gre}.> Good morrow neighbour {Baptista}.
901   *<S {Bap}.>  Good morrow neighbour {Gremio}: God saue
902    you Gentlemen.
903   *<S {Pet}.> And you good sir: pray haue you not a daugh-ter,
904    cal'd {Katerina}, faire and vertuous.
905    <S {Bap}.> I haue a daughter sir, cal'd {Katerina}.
906    <S {Gre}.> You are too blunt, go to it orderly.
907    <S {Pet}.> You wrong me signior {Gremio}, giue me leaue.
908    I am a Gentleman of {Verona} sir,
909    That hearing of her beautie, and her wit,
910    Her affability and bashfull modestie:
911    Her wondrous qualities, and milde behauiour,
912    Am bold to shew my selfe a forward guest
913    Within your house, to make mine eye the witnesse
914    Of that report, which I so oft haue heard,
915    And for an entrance to my entertainment,
916    I do present you with a man of mine
917    Cunning in Musicke, and the Mathematickes,
918    To instruct her fully in those sciences,
919    Whereof I know she is not ignorant,
920    Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.
921    His name is {Litio}, borne in {Mantua}.
922    <S {Bap}.> Y'are welcome sir, and he for your good sake.
923    But for my daughter {Katerine}, this I know,
924    She is not for your turne, the more my greefe.
925    <S {Pet}.> I see you do not meane to part with her,
926    Or else you like not of my companie.
927    <S {Bap}.> Mistake me not, I speake but as I finde,
928    Whence are you sir? What may I call your name.
929    <S {Pet}.> {Petruchio} is my name, {Antonio's}  sonne,
930    A man well knowne throughout all Italy.
931   *<S {Bap}.>  I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
932   *<S {Gre}.>  Sauing your tale {Petruchio}, I pray let vs that are
933   *poore  petitioners speake too? {Bacare}, you are meruay-lous
934    forward.
935   *<S {Pet}.>  Oh, Pardon me signior {Gremio}, I would faine be
936    doing.
937    <S {Gre}.> I doubt it not sir. But you will curse
938    Your wooing neighbors: this is a guift
939    Very gratefull, I am sure of it, to expresse
940    The like kindnesse my selfe, that haue beene
941    More kindely beholding to you then any:
942    Freely giue vnto this yong Scholler, that hath
943    Beene long studying at {Rhemes}, as cunning
944    In Greeke, Latine, and other Languages,
945    As the other in Musicke and Mathematickes:
946    His name is {Cambio}: pray accept his seruice.
947    <S {Bap}.> A thousand thankes signior {Gremio}:
948    Welcome good {Cambio}. But gentle sir,
949    Me thinkes you walke like a stranger,
950   *May  I be so bold, to know the cause of your comming?
951    <S {Tra}.> Pardon me sir, the boldnesse is mine owne,
952    That being a stranger in this Cittie heere,
953    Do make my selfe a sutor to your daughter,
954    Vnto {Bianca}, faire and vertuous:
955    Nor is your firme resolue vnknowne to me,
956    In  the preferment of the eldest sister.
957    This liberty is all that I request,
958    That vpon knowledge of my Parentage,
959    I may haue welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
960    And free accesse and fauour as the rest.
961    And toward the education of your daughters:
962    I heere bestow a simple instrument,
963    And this small packet of Greeke and Latine bookes:
964    If you accept them, then their worth is great:
965    <S {Bap}.> {Lucentio}  is your name, of whence I pray.
966    <S {Tra}.> Of {Pisa} sir, sonne to {Vincentio}.
967    <S {Bap}.>  A mightie man of {Pisa} by report,
968    I know him well: you are verie welcome sir:
969    Take you the Lute, and you the set of bookes,
970    You shall go see your Pupils presently.
971    Holla, within.
972    <D {Enter a Seruant}>.
973    Sirrah, leade these Gentlemen
974    To my daughters, and tell them both
975    These are their Tutors, bid them vse them well,
976    We will go walke a little in the Orchard,
977    And then to dinner: you are passing welcome,
978    And so I pray you all to thinke your selues.
979    <S {Pet}.>  Signior {Baptista}, my businesse asketh haste,
980    And euerie day I cannot come to woo,
981    You knew my father well, and in him me,
982    Left solie heire to all his Lands and goods,
983    Which I haue bettered rather then decreast,
984    Then tell me, if I get your daughters loue,
985    What dowrie shall I haue with her to wife.
986    <S {Bap}.> After my death, the one halfe of my Lands,
987    And in possession twentie thousand Crownes.
988    <S {Pet}.> And for that dowrie, Ile assure her of
989    Her widdow- hood, be it that she suruiue me
990    In all my Lands and Leases whatsoeuer,
991    Let specialties be therefore drawne betweene vs,
992    That couenants may be kept on either hand.
993    <S {Bap}.> #I,  when the speciall thing is well obtain'd,
994    That is her loue: for that is all in all.
995    <S {Pet}.> Why that is nothing: for I tell you father,
996    I am as peremptorie as she proud minded:
997    And where two raging fires meete together,
998    They do consume the thing that feedes their furie.
999    Though little fire growes great with little winde,
1000   Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
1001   So I to her, and so she yeelds to me,
1002   For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.
1003  *<S {Bap}.>  Well maist thou woo, and happy be thy speed:
1004   But be thou arm'd for some vnhappie words.
1005   <S {Pet}.> #I  to the proofe, as Mountaines are for windes,
1006   That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.
1007   <D {Enter Hortensio with his head broke}.>
      <P S6v>
1008   <S {Bap}.> How now my friend, why dost thou looke so
1009   pale?
1010   <S {Hor}.> For feare I promise you, if I looke pale.
1011  *<S {Bap}.> What, will my daughter proue a good Musiti-an?
1012  _
1013   <S {Hor}.> I thinke she'l sooner proue a souldier,
1014   Iron may hold with her, but neuer Lutes.
1015  *<S {Bap}.>  Why then thou canst not break her to the Lute?
1016   <S {Hor}.> Why no, for she hath broke the Lute to me:
1017   I did but tell her she mistooke her frets,
1018   And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
1019   When (with a most impatient diuellish spirit)
1020   Frets call you these? (quoth she) Ile fume with them:
1021   And with that word she stroke me on the head,
1022   And through the instrument my pate made way,
1023   And there I stood amazed for #a while,
1024   As on a Pillorie, looking through the Lute,
1025   While she did call me Rascall, Fidler,
1026  *And  twangling Iacke, with twentie such vilde tearmes,
1027   As had she studied to misvse me so.
1028   <S {Pet}.> Now by the world, it is a lustie Wench,
1029   I loue her ten times more then ere I did,
1030   Oh how I long to haue some chat with her.
1031   <S {Bap}.> Wel go with me, and be not so discomfited.
1032   Proceed in practise with my yonger daughter,
1033   She's apt to learne, and thankefull for good turnes:
1034   Signior {Petruchio}, will you go with vs,
1035   Or  shall I send my daughter {Kate} to you.
1036   <D {Exit. Manet Petruchio}.>
1037   <S {Pet}.> I pray you do. Ile attend her heere,
1038   And woo her with some spirit when she comes,
1039   Say that she raile, why then Ile tell her plaine,
1040   She sings as sweetly as a Nightinghale:
1041   Say that she  frowne, Ile say she lookes as cleere
1042   As morning Roses newly washt with dew:
1043   Say she be mute, and will not speake a word,
1044   Then Ile commend her volubility,
1045   And say she vttereth piercing eloquence:
1046   If she do bid me packe, Ile giue her thankes,
1047   As though she bid me stay by her a weeke:
1048   If she denie to wed, Ile craue the day
1049   When I shall aske the banes, and when be married.
1050   But heere she comes, and now {Petruchio} speake.
1051   <D {Enter Katerina}>.
1052   Good morrow {Kate}, for thats your name I heare.
1053  *<S {Kate}.>  Well haue you heard, but something hard of
1054   hearing:
1055   They call me {Katerine}, that do talke of me.
1056   <S {Pet}.> You lye infaith, for you are call'd plaine {Kate},
1057   And bony {Kate}, and sometimes {Kate} the curst:
1058   But {Kate}, the prettiest {Kate} in Christendome,
1059   {#Kate} of {Kate}- hall, my super- daintie {Kate},
1060   For dainties are all {Kates}, and therefore {Kate}
1061   Take this of me, {Kate} of my consolation,
1062   Hearing thy mildnesse prais'd in euery Towne,
1063   Thy vertues spoke of, and thy beautie sounded,
1064   Yet not so deepely as to thee belongs,
1065   My selfe am moou'd to woo thee for my wife.
1066  *<S {Kate}.>  Mou'd, in good time, let him that mou'd you
1067   hether
1068   Remoue you hence: I knew you at the first
1069   You were a mouable.
1070   <S {Pet}.> Why, what's a mouable?
1071   <S {Kat}.> A ioyn'd stoole.
1072   <S {Pet}.> Thou hast hit it: come sit on me.
1073   <S {Kate}.> Asses are made to beare, and so are you.
1074   <S {Pet}.>  Women are made to beare, and so are you.
1075   <S {Kate}.> No such Iade as you, if me you meane.
1076   <S {Pet}.> Alas good {Kate}, I will not burthen thee,
1077   For knowing thee to be but yong and light.
1078   <S {Kate}.> Too light for such a swaine as you to catch,
1079   And yet as heauie as my waight should be.
1080   <S {Pet}.> Shold be, should: buzze.
1081   <S {Kate}.> Well tane, and like a buzzard.
1082  *<S {Pet}.> Oh slow- wing'd Turtle, shal a buzard take thee?
1083   <S {Kat}.> #I  for a Turtle, as he takes a buzard.
1084  *<S {Pet}.>  Come, come you Waspe, y'faith you are too
1085   angrie.
1086   <S {Kate}.> If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
1087   <S {Pet}.> My remedy is then to plucke it out.
1088   <S {Kate}.> #I,  if the foole could finde it where it lies.
1089  *<S {Pet}.>  Who knowes not where a Waspe does weare
1090   his sting? In his taile.
1091   <S {Kate}.> In his tongue?
1092   <S {Pet}.> Whose tongue.
1093   <S {Kate}.> Yours if you talke of tales, and so farewell.
1094   <S {Pet}.> What with my tongue in your taile.
1095   Nay, come againe, good {Kate}, I am a Gentleman,
1096   <S {Kate}.> That Ile trie.  <D {she strikes him}>
1097   <S {Pet}.> I sweare Ile cuffe you, if you strike againe.
1098   <S {Kate}.> So may you loose your armes,
1099   If you strike me, you are no Gentleman,
1100   And if no Gentleman, why then no armes.
1101   <S {Pet}.> A Herald {Kate}?  Oh put me in thy bookes.
1102   <S {Kate}.> What is your Crest, a Coxcombe?
1103   <S {Pet}.> A comblesse Cocke, so {Kate} will be my Hen.
1104  *<S {Kate}.>  No Cocke of mine, you crow too like a crauen
1105  *<S {Pet}.>  Nay come {Kate}, come: you must not looke so
1106   sowre.
1107   <S {Kate}.> It is my fashion when I see a Crab.
1108  *<S {Pet}.>  Why heere's no crab, and therefore looke not
1109   sowre.
1110   <S {Kate}.> There is, there is.
1111   <S {Pet}.> Then shew it me.
1112   <S {Kate}.> Had I a glasse, I would.
1113   <S {Pet}.>  What, you meane my face.
1114   <S {Kate}.> Well aym'd of such a yong one.
1115   <S {Pet}.> Now by S[aint]. George I am too yong for you.
1116   <S {Kate}.> Yet you are wither'd.
1117   <S {Pet}.> 'Tis with cares.
1118   <S {Kate}.> I care not.
1119  *<S {Pet}.>  Nay heare you {Kate}. Insooth you scape not so.
1120   <S {Kate}.> I chafe you if I tarrie. Let me go.
1121   <S {Pet}.> No, not a  whit, I finde you passing gentle:
1122   'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
1123   And now I finde report a very liar:
1124   For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
1125   But slow in speech: yet sweet as spring- time flowers.
1126   Thou canst not frowne, thou canst not looke #a sconce,
1127   Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
1128   Nor hast thou pleasure to be crosse in talke:
1129   But thou with mildnesse entertain'st thy wooers,
1130   With gentle conference, soft, and affable.
1131   Why does the world report that {Kate} doth limpe?
1132   Oh sland'rous world: {Kate}  like the hazle twig
1133   Is straight, and slender, and as browne in hue
1134   As hazle nuts, and sweeter then the kernels:
1135   Oh let me see thee walke: thou dost not halt.
1136   <S {Kate}.> Go foole, and whom thou keep'st command.
1137   <S {Pet}.> Did euer {Dian}  so become a Groue
1138   As {Kate} this chamber with her princely gate:
1139   O be thou {Dian}, and let her be {Kate},
      <P T1><C C>
1140   And then let {Kate} be chaste, and {Dian} sportfull.
1141   <S {Kate}.> Where did you study all this goodly speech?
1142   <S {Petr}.> It is {extempore}, from my mother wit.
1143   <S {Kate}.>  A witty mother, witlesse else her sonne.
1144   <S {Pet}.> Am I not wise?
1145   <S {Kat}.> Yes, keepe you warme.
1146   <S {Pet}.> Marry so I meane sweet {Katherine} in thy bed:
1147   And therefore setting all this chat aside,
1148   Thus in plaine termes: your father hath consented
1149   That you shall be my wife; your dowry greed on,
1150   And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
1151   Now {Kate}, I am a husband for your turne,
1152   For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
1153   Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
1154   Thou must be married to no man but me,
1155   <D {Enter Baptista, Gremio, Trayno}.>
1156   For I am he am borne to tame you {Kate},
1157   And bring you from a wilde {Kate} to a {Kate}
1158   Conformable as other houshold {Kates}:
1159   Heere comes your father, neuer make deniall,
1160   I must, and will haue {Katherine} to my wife.
1161  *<S {Bap}.> Now Signior {Petruchio}, how speed you with my |(daughter?
1162   <S {Pet}.> How but well sir? how but well?
1163   It were impossible I should speed amisse.
1164  *<S {Bap}.> Why how now daughter {Katherine}, in your |(dumps?
1165   <S {Kat}.> Call you me daughter? now I promise you
1166   You haue shewd a tender fatherly regard,
1167   To wish me wed to one halfe Lunaticke,
1168   A mad- cap ruffian, and a swearing Iacke,
1169   That thinkes with oathes to face the matter out.
1170   <S {Pet}.> Father, 'tis thus, your selfe and all the world
1171   That talk'd of her, haue talk'd amisse of her:
1172   If she be curst, it is for pollicie,
1173   For shee's not froward, but modest as the Doue,
1174   Shee is not hot, but temperate as the morne,
1175   For patience shee will proue a second {Grissell},
1176   And Romane {Lucrece} for her chastitie:
1177   And to conclude, we haue greed so well together,
1178   That vpon sonday is the wedding day.
1179   <S {Kate}.> Ile see thee hang'd on sonday first.
1180  *<S {Gre}.> Hark {Petruchio}, she saies shee'll see thee hang'd |(first.
1181  *<S {Tra}.> Is this your speeding? nay the[n] godnight our part.
1182  *<S {Pet}.> Be patient gentlemen, I choose her for my selfe,
1183   If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
1184   'Tis bargain'd twixt vs twaine being alone,
1185   That she shall still be curst in company.
1186   I tell you 'tis incredible to beleeue
1187   How much she loues me: oh the kindest {Kate},
1188   Shee hung about my necke, and kisse on kisse
1189   Shee vi'd so fast, protesting oath on oath,
1190   That in a twinke she won me to her loue.
1191   Oh you are nouices, 'tis a world to see
1192   How tame when men and women are alone,
1193   A meacocke wretch can make the curstest shrew:
1194   Giue me thy hand {Kate}, I will vnto {Venice}
1195   To buy apparell 'gainst the wedding day;
1196   Prouide the feast father, and bid the guests,
1197   I will be sure my {Katherine} shall be fine.
1198  *<S {Bap}.> I know not what to say, but giue me your ha[n]ds,
1199   God send you ioy, {Petruchio}, 'tis a match.
1200   <S {Gre}. {Tra}.> Amen say we, we will be witnesses.
1201   <S {Pet}.> Father, and wife, and gentlemen adieu,
1202   I will to {Venice}, sonday comes apace,
1203   We will haue rings, and things, and fine array,
1204   And kisse me {Kate}, we will be married #a sonday.
1205   <D {Exit Petruchio and Katherine}.>
1206   <S {Gre}.> Was euer match clapt vp so sodainly?
1207  *<S {Bap}.> Faith Gentlemen now I play a marchants part,
1208   And venture madly on a desperate Mart.
1209   <S {Tra}.> Twas  a commodity lay fretting by you,
1210   'Twill bring you gaine, or perish on the seas.
1211   <S {Bap}.> The gaine I seeke, is quiet me the match.
1212   <S {Gre}.> No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch:
1213   But now {Baptista}, to your yonger daughter,
1214   Now is the day we long haue looked for,
1215   I am your neighbour, and was suter first.
1216   <S {Tra}.> And I am one that loue {Bianca} more
1217   Then words can witnesse, or your thoughts can guesse.
1218   <S {Gre}.> Yongling thou canst not loue so deare as I.
1219   <S {Tra}.> Gray- beard thy loue doth freeze.
1220   <S {Gre}.> But thine doth frie,
1221   Skipper stand backe, 'tis age that nourisheth.
1222   <S {Tra}.> But youth in Ladies eyes that florisheth.
1223  *<S {Bap}.> Content you gentlemen, I wil co[m]pound this strife
1224   'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
1225   That can assure my daughter greatest dower,
1226   Shall haue my {Biancas} loue.
1227   Say signior {Gremio}, what can you assure her?
1228   <S {Gre}.> First, as you know, my house within the City
1229   Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
1230   Basons and ewers to laue her dainty hands:
1231   My hangings all of {tirian} tapestry:
1232   In Iuory cofers I haue stuft my crownes:
1233   In Cypres chests my arras counterpoints,
1234   Costly apparell, tents, and Canopies,
1235   Fine Linnen, Turky cushions bost with pearle,
1236   Vallens of Venice gold, in needle worke:
1237   Pewter and brasse, and all things that belongs
1238   To house or house- keeping: then at my farme
1239   I haue a hundred milch- kine to the pale,
1240   Sixe- score fat Oxen standing in my stalls,
1241   And all things answerable to this portion.
1242   My selfe am strooke in yeeres I must confesse,
1243   And if I die to morrow this is hers,
1244   If whil'st I liue she will be onely mine.
1245   <S {Tra}.>  That only came well in: sir, list to me,
1246   I am my fathers heyre and onely sonne,
1247   If I may haue your daughter to my wife,
1248   Ile leaue her houses three or foure as good
1249   Within rich {Pisa} walls, as any one
1250   Old Signior {Gremio}  has in {Padua},
1251   Besides, two thousand Duckets by the yeere
1252   Of fruitfull land, all which shall be her ioynter.
1253   What, haue I pincht you Signior {Gremio}?
1254   <S {Gre}.> Two thousand Duckets by the yeere of land,
1255   My Land amounts not to so much in all:
1256   That she shall haue, besides an Argosie
1257   That now is lying in Marcellus roade:
1258   What, haue I choakt you with an Argosie?
1259   <S {Tra}.> {Gremio}, 'tis knowne my father hath no lesse
1260   Then three great Argosies, besides two Galliasses
1261   And twelue tite Gallies, these I will assure her,
1262   And twice as much what ere thou offrest next.
1263   <S {Gre}.> Nay, I haue offred all, I haue no more,
1264   And she can haue no more then all I haue,
1265   If you like me, she shall haue me and mine.
1266  *<S {Tra}.>  Why then the maid is mine from all the world
1267   By your firme promise, {Gremio} is out- vied.
1268   <S {Bap}.> I must confesse your offer is the best,
1269   And let your father make her the assurance,
      <P T1v>
1270   Shee is your owne, else you must pardon me:
1271   If you should die before him, where's her dower?
1272   <S {Tra}.>  That's but a cauill: he is olde, I young.
1273   <S {Gre}.> And may not yong men die as well as old?
1274   <S {Bap}.> Well gentlemen, I am thus resolu'd,
1275   On sonday next, you know
1276   My daughter {Katherine} is to be married:
1277   Now on the sonday following, shall {Bianca}
1278   Be Bride to you, if you make this assurance:
1279   If not, to Signior {Gremio}:
1280   And so I take my leaue, and thanke you both.  <D {Exit}.>
1281   <S {Gre}.> Adieu good neighbour: now I feare thee not:
1282   Sirra, yong gamester, your father were a foole
1283   To giue thee all, and in his wayning age
1284   Set foot vnder thy table: tut, a toy,
1285   An olde Italian foxe is not so kinde my boy.  <D {Exit}.>
1286   <S {Tra}.> A vengeance on your crafty withered hide,
1287   Yet I haue fac'd it with a card of ten:
1288   'Tis in my head to doe my master good:
1289   I see no reason but suppos'd {Lucentio}
1290   Must get a father, call'd suppos'd {Vincentio},
1291   And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
1292   Doe get their children: but in this case of woing,
1293  *A  childe shall get a sire, if I faile not of my cunning.  <D {Exit}.>
1294   <Z {Actus Tertia}.>
1295   <D {Enter Lucentio, Hortentio, and Bianca}.>
1296   <S {Luc}.> Fidler forbeare, you grow too forward Sir,
1297   Haue you so soone forgot the entertainment
1298   Her sister {Katherine} welcom'd you withall.
1299   <S {Hort}.> But wrangling pedant, this is
1300   The patronesse of heauenly harmony:
1301   Then giue me leaue to haue prerogatiue,
1302   And when in Musicke we haue spent an houre,
1303   Your Lecture shall haue leisure for as much.
1304   <S {Luc}.> Preposterous Asse that neuer read so farre,
1305   To know the cause why musicke was ordain'd:
1306   Was it not to refresh the minde of man
1307   After his studies, or his vsuall paine?
1308   Then giue me leaue to read Philosophy,
1309   And while I pause, serue in your harmony.
1310   <S {Hort}.> Sirra, I will not beare these braues of thine.
1311  *<S {Bianc}.> Why gentlemen, you doe me double wrong,
1312   To striue for that which resteth in my choice:
1313   I am no breeching scholler in the schooles,
1314   Ile not be tied to howres, nor pointed times,
1315   But learne my Lessons as I please my selfe,
1316   And to cut off all strife: heere sit we downe,
1317   Take you your instrument, play you the whiles,
1318   His Lecture will be done ere you haue tun'd.
1319   <S {Hort}.> You'll leaue his Lecture when I am in tune?
1320   <S {Luc}.> That will be neuer, tune your instrument.
1321   <S {Bian}.> Where left we last?
1322  *<S {Luc}.>  Heere Madam: {Hic Ibat Simois, hic est sigeria}
1323   {tellus, hic steterat Priami regia Celsa senis}.
1324   <S {Bian}.> Conster them.
1325  *<S {Luc}.>  {Hic Ibat}, as I told you before, {Simois}, I am Lu-centio,
1326  *{hic est}, sonne vnto Vincentio of Pisa, {Sigeria tel-lus},
1327  *disguised  thus to get your loue, {hic steterat}, and that
1328  *Lucentio  that comes #a  wooing, {priami}, is my man Tra-nio,
1329  *{regia},  bearing my port, {celsa senis} that we might be-guile
1330   the old Pantalowne.
1331   <S {Hort}.> Madam, my Instrument's in tune.
1332   <S {Bian}.> Let's heare, oh fie, the treble iarres.
1333   <S {Luc}.> Spit in the hole man, and tune againe.
1334  *<S {Bian}.>  Now let mee see if I can conster it. {Hic ibat si-mois},
1335  *I know you not, {hic est sigeria tellus}, I trust you not,
1336  *{hic staterat priami}, take heede he heare vs not, {regia} pre-sume
1337   not, {Celsa senis}, despaire not.
1338   <S {Hort}.> Madam, tis now in tune.
1339   <S {Luc}.> All but the base.
1340  *<S {Hort}.>  The base is right, 'tis the base knaue that iars.
1341   <S {Luc}.> How fiery and forward our Pedant is,
1342   Now for my life the knaue doth court my loue,
1343   {Pedascule}, Ile watch you better yet:
1344   In time I may beleeue, yet I mistrust.
1345   <S {Bian}.> Mistrust it not, for sure {Aeacides}
1346   Was {Aiax} cald so from his grandfather.
1347   <S {Hort}.>  I must beleeue my master, else I promise you,
1348   I should be arguing still vpon that doubt,
1349   But let it rest, now {Litio} to you:
1350   Good master take it not vnkindly pray
1351   That I haue beene thus pleasant with you both.
1352  *<S {Hort}.>  You may go walk, and giue me leaue #a while,
1353   My Lessons make no musicke in three parts.
1354   <S {Luc}.> Are you so formall sir, well I must waite
1355   And watch withall, for but I be deceiu'd,
1356   Our fine Musitian groweth amorous.
1357   <S {Hor}.> Madam, before you touch the instrument,
1358   To learne the order of my fingering,
1359   I must begin with rudiments of #Art,
1360   To teach you gamoth in a briefer sort,
1361   More pleasant, pithy, and effectuall,
1362   Then hath beene taught by any of my trade,
1363   And there it is in writing fairely drawne.
1364   <S {Bian}.> Why, I am past my gamouth long agoe.
1365   <S {Hor}.> Yet read the gamouth of {Hortentio}.
1366   <S {Bian}.> {Gamouth} I am, the ground of all accord:
1367   {#Are},  to plead {Hortensio}'s passion:
1368   {Beeme}, {Bianca} take him for thy Lord
1369   {Cfavt}, that loues with all affection:
1370   {D sol re}, one Cliffe, two notes haue I,
1371   {Ela mi}, show pitty or I die,
1372   Call you this gamouth? tut I like it not,
1373   Old fashions please me best, I am not so nice
1374   To charge true rules for old inuentions.
1375   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1376  *<S {Nicke}.>  Mistresse, your father prayes you leaue your |(books,
1377   And helpe to dresse your sisters chamber vp,
1378   You know to morrow is the wedding day.
1379  *<S {Bian}.>  Farewell sweet masters both, I must be gone.
1380   <S {Luc}.> Faith Mistresse then I haue no cause to stay.
1381   <S {Hor}.> But I haue cause to pry into this pedant,
1382   Methinkes he lookes as though he were in loue:
1383   Yet if thy thoughts {Bianca} be so humble
1384   To cast thy wandring eyes on euery stale:
1385   Seize thee that List, if once I finde thee ranging,
1386   {Hortensio} will be quit with thee by changing.  <D {Exit}.>
1387  *<D {Enter  Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherine, Bianca, and o-thers},
1388   {attendants}.>
1389   <S {Bap}.> Signior {Lucentio}, this is the pointed day
1390   That {Katherine} and {Petruchio} should be married,
1391   And yet we heare not of our sonne in Law:
1392   What will be said, what mockery will it be?
1393   To want the Bride- groome when the Priest attends
1394   To speake the ceremoniall rites of marriage?
1395   What saies {Lucentio} to this shame of ours?
      <P T2>
1396   <S {Kate}.> No shame but mine, I must forsooth be forst
1397   To giue my hand oppos'd against my heart
1398   Vnto a mad- braine rudesby, full of spleene,
1399   Who woo'd in haste, and meanes to wed at leysure:
1400   I told you I, he was a franticke foole,
1401   Hiding his bitter iests in blunt behauiour,
1402   And to be noted for a merry man;
1403   Hee'll wooe a thousand, point the day of marriage,
1404   Make friends, inuite, and proclaime the banes,
1405   Yet neuer meanes to wed where he hath woo'd:
1406   Now must the world point at poore {Katherine},
1407   And say, loe, there is mad {Petruchio}'s wife
1408   If it would please him come and marry her.
1409   <S {Tra}.> Patience good {Katherine} and {Baptista} too,
1410   Vpon my life {Petruchio} meanes but well,
1411   What euer fortune stayes him from his word,
1412   Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise,
1413   Though he be merry, yet withall he's honest.
1414  *<S {Kate}.>   Would {Katherine} had neuer seen him though.
1415   <D {Exit weeping}.>
1416  *<S {Bap}.>  Goe girle, I cannot blame thee now to weepe,
1417   For such an iniurie would vexe a very saint,
1418   Much more a shrew of impatient humour.
1419   <D {Enter Biondello}.>
1420  *<S {Bion}.>  Master, master, newes, and such newes as you
1421   neuer heard of,
1422   <S {Bap}.> Is it new and olde too? how may that be?
1423  *<S {Bion}.>  Why, is it not newes to heard of {Petruchio's} |(comming?
1424   <S {Bap}.> Is he come?
1425   <S {Bion}.> Why no sir.
1426   <S {Bap}.> What then?
1427   <S {Bion}.> He is comming.
1428   <S {Bap}.> When will he be heere?
1429  *<S {Bion}.> When he stands where I am, and sees you there.
1430   <S {Tra}.> But say, what to thine olde newes?
1431  *<S {Bion}.>  Why {Petruchio} is comming, in a new hat and
1432  *an old ierkin, a paire of old breeches thrice turn'd; a
1433  *paire of bootes that haue beene candle- cases, one buck-led,
1434  *another  lac'd: an olde rusty sword tane out of the
1435  *Towne  Armory, with a broken hilt, and chapelesse: with
1436  *two  broken points: his horse hip'd with an olde mo-thy
1437  *saddle,  and stirrops of no kindred: besides possest
1438  *with  the glanders, and like to mose in the chine, trou-bled
1439  *with  the Lampasse, infected with the fashions, full
1440  *of  Windegalls, sped with Spauins, raied with the Yel-lowes,
1441  *past  cure of the Fiues, starke spoyl'd with the
1442  *Staggers,  begnawne with the Bots, Waid in the backe,
1443  *and shoulder- shotten, neere leg'd before, and with a
1444  *halfe- chekt Bitte, & a headstall of sheepes leather, which
1445  *being  restrain'd to keepe him from stumbling, hath been
1446  *often  burst, and now repaired with knots: one girth sixe
1447  *times  peec'd, and a womans Crupper of velure, which
1448  *hath  two letters for her name, fairely set down in studs,
1449   and heere and there peec'd with packthred.
1450   <S {Bap}.> Who comes with him?
1451  *<S {Bion}.>  Oh sir, his Lackey, for all the world Capari-son'd
1452  *like  the horse: with a linnen stock on one leg, and
1453  *a kersey boot- hose on the other, gartred with a red and
1454  *blew  list; an old hat, & the humor of forty fancies prickt
1455  *in't  for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparell,
1456  *& not like a Christian foot- boy, or a gentlemans Lacky.
1457  *<S {Tra}.>  'Tis some od humor pricks him to this fashion,
1458   Yet oftentimes he goes but meane apparel'd.
1459   <S {Bap}.> I am glad he's come, howsoere he comes.
1460   <S {Bion}.> Why sir, he comes not.
1461   <S {Bap}.> Didst thou not say hee comes?
1462   <S {Bion}.> Who, that {Petruchio} came?
1463   <S {Bap}.> #I, that {Petruchio} came.
1464  *<S {Bion}.>  No sir, I say his horse comes with him on his |(backe.
1465   <S {Bap}.> Why that's all one.
1466  *<S {Bion}.>  Nay by S[aint]. {Iamy}, I hold you a penny, a horse and
1467   a man is more then one, and yet not many.
1468   <D {Enter Petruchio and Grumio}.>
1469  *<S {Pet}.>  Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
1470   <S {Bap}.>  You are welcome sir.
1471   <S {Petr}.> And yet I come not well.
1472   <S {Bap}.> And yet you halt not.
1473   <S {Tra}.> Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were.
1474   <S {Petr}.> Were it better I should rush in thus:
1475   But where is {Kate}? where is my louely Bride?
1476   How does my father? gentles methinkes you frowne,
1477   And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
1478   As if they saw some wondrous monument,
1479   Some Commet, or vnusuall prodigie?
1480   <S {Bap}.> Why sir, you know this is your wedding day:
1481   First were we sad, fearing you would not come,
1482   Now sadder that you come so vnprouided:
1483   Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
1484   An eye- sore to our solemne festiuall.
1485   <S {Tra}.> And tell vs what occasion of import
1486   Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
1487   And sent you hither so vnlike your selfe?
1488   <S {Petr}.> Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to heare,
1489   Sufficeth I am come to keepe my word,
1490   Though in some part inforced to digresse,
1491   Which at more leysure I will so excuse,
1492   As you shall well be satisfied with all.
1493   But where is {Kate}? I stay too long from her,
1494   The morning weares, 'tis time we were at Church.
1495   <S {Tra}.> See not your Bride in these vnreuerent robes,
1496   Goe to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
1497   <S {Pet}.> Not I, beleeue me, thus Ile visit her.
1498   <S {Bap}.> But thus I trust you will not marry her.
1499  *<S {Pet}.> Good sooth euen thus: therefore #ha done with |(words,
1500   To me she's married, not vnto my cloathes:
1501   Could I repaire what she will weare in me,
1502   As I can change these poore accoutrements,
1503   'Twere well for {Kate}, and better for my selfe.
1504   But what a foole am I to chat with you,
1505   When I should bid good morrow to my Bride?
1506   And seale the title with a louely kisse.  <D {Exit}.>
1507   <S {Tra}.> He hath some meaning in his mad attire,
1508   We will perswade him be it possible,
1509   To put on better ere he goe to Church.
1510   <S {Bap}.> Ile after him, and see the euent of this.  <D {Exit}.>
1511   <S {Tra}.> But sir, Loue concerneth vs to adde
1512   Her fathers liking, which to bring to passe
1513   As before imparted to your worship,
1514   I am to get a man what ere he be,
1515   It skills not much, weele fit him to our turne,
1516   And he shall be {Vincentio} of {Pisa},
1517   And make assurance heere in {Padua}
1518   Of greater summes then I haue promised,
1519   So shall you quietly enioy your hope,
1520   And marry sweet {Bianca} with consent.
1521   <S {Luc}.> Were it not that my fellow schoolemaster
1522   Doth watch {Bianca's} steps so narrowly:
1523   'Twere good me- thinkes to steale our marriage,
1524   Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
1525   Ile keepe mine owne despite of all the world.
1526   <S {Tra}.> That by degrees we meane to looke into,
      <P T2v>
1527   And watch our vantage in this businesse,
1528   Wee'll ouer- reach the grey- beard {Gremio},
1529   The narrow prying father {Minola},
1530   The quaint Musician, amorous {Litio},
1531   All for my Masters sake {Lucentio}.
1532   <D {Enter Gremio}.>
1533   Signior {Gremio}, came you from the Church?
1534   <S {Gre}.> As willingly as ere I came from schoole.
1535  *<S {Tra}.>  And is the Bride & Bridegroom coming home?
1536  *<S {Gre}.>  A bridegroome say you? 'tis a groome indeed,
1537   A grumlling groome, and that the girle shall finde.
1538   <S {Tra}.> Curster then she, why 'tis impossible.
1539   <S {Gre}.> Why hee's a deuill, a deuill, a very fiend.
1540   <S {Tra}.> Why she's a deuill, a deuill, the deuils damme.
1541   <S {Gre}.> Tut, she's a Lambe, a Doue, a foole to him:
1542   Ile tell you sir {Lucentio};  when the Priest
1543   Should aske if {Katherine} should be his wife,
1544   #I,  by goggs woones quoth he, and swore so loud,
1545   That all amaz'd the Priest let fall the booke,
1546   And as he stoop'd againe to take it vp,
1547  *This mad- brain'd bridegroome tooke him such a cuffe,
1548  *That  downe fell Priest and booke, and booke and Priest,
1549   Now take them vp quoth he, if any list.
1550   <S {Tra}.> What said the wench when he rose againe?
1551  *<S {Gre}.>  Trembled and shooke: for why, he stamp'd and
1552  *swore,  as if the Vicar meant to cozen him: but after ma-ny
1553  *ceremonies  done, hee calls for wine, a health quoth
1554  *he, as if he had beene aboord carowsing to his Mates af-ter
1555  *a  storme, quaft off the Muscadell, and threw the sops
1556  *all  in the Sextons face: hauing no other reason, but that
1557  *his  beard grew thinne and hungerly, and seem'd to aske
1558  *him  sops as hee was drinking: This done, hee tooke the
1559  *Bride  about the necke, and kist her lips with such a cla-morous
1560  *smacke,  that at the parting all the Church did
1561  *eccho:  and I seeing this, came thence for very shame, and
1562  *after  mee I know the rout is comming, such a mad mar-ryage
1563  *neuer  was before: harke, harke, I heare the min-strels
1564   play.  <D {Musicke playes}.>
1565   <D {Enter Petruchio, Kate, Bianca, Hortensio, Baptista}.>
1566  *<S {Petr}.>  Gentlemen & friends, I thank you for your pains,
1567   I know you thinke to dine with me to day,
1568   And haue prepar'd great store of wedding cheere,
1569   But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
1570   And therefore heere I meane to take my leaue.
1571   <S {Bap}.>  Is't possible you will away to night?
1572   <S {Pet}.> I must away to day before night come,
1573   Make it no wonder: if you knew my businesse,
1574   You would intreat me rather goe then stay:
1575   And honest company, I thanke you all,
1576   That haue beheld me giue away my selfe
1577   To this most patient, sweet, and vertuous wife,
1578   Dine with my father, drinke a health to me,
1579   For I must hence, and farewell to you all.
1580   <S {Tra}.> Let vs intreat you stay till after dinner.
1581   <S {Pet}.> It may not be.
1582   <S {Gra}.> Let me intreat you.
1583   <S {Pet}.> It cannot be.
1584   <S {Kat}.> Let me intreat you.
1585   <S {Pet}.> I am content.
1586   <S {Kat}.> Are you content to stay?
1587   <S {Pet}.> I am content you shall entreat me stay,
1588   But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
1589   <S {Kat}.> Now if you loue me stay.
1590   <S {Pet}.> {Grumio}, my horse.
1591  *<S {Gru}.> #I sir, they be ready, the Oates haue eaten the
1592   horses.
1593   <S {Kate}.> Nay then,
1594   Doe what thou canst, I will not goe to day,
1595   No, nor to morrow, not till I please my selfe,
1596   The dore is open sir, there lies your way,
1597   You may be iogging whiles your bootes are greene:
1598   For me, Ile not be gone till I please my selfe,
1599   'Tis like you'll proue a iolly surly groome,
1600   That take it on you at the first so roundly.
1601   <S {Pet}.>  O {Kate} content thee, prethee be not angry.
1602   <S {Kat}.> I will be angry, what hast thou to doe?
1603   Father, be quiet, he shall stay my leisure.
1604   <S {Gre}.> #I  marry sir, now it begins to worke.
1605   <S {Kat}.> Gentlemen, forward to the bridall dinner,
1606   I see a woman may be made a foole
1607   If she had not a spirit to resist.
1608  *<S {Pet}.>  They shall goe forward {Kate} at thy command,
1609   Obey the Bride you that attend on her.
1610   Goe to the feast, reuell and domineere,
1611   Carowse full measure to her maiden- head,
1612   Be madde and merry, or goe hang your selues:
1613   But for my bonny {Kate}, she must with me:
1614   Nay, looke not big, nor stampe, not stare, nor fret,
1615   I will be master of what is mine owne,
1616   Shee is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
1617   My houshold- stuffe, my field, my barne,
1618   My horse, my oxe, my asse, my any thing,
1619   And heere she stands, touch her who euer dare,
1620   Ile bring mine action on the proudest #he
1621   That stops my way in {Padua}: {Grumio}
1622   Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with theeues,
1623   Rescue thy Mistresse if thou be a man:
1624   Feare  not sweet wench, they shall not touch thee {Kate},
1625   Ile buckler thee against a Million.  <D {Exeunt. P. Ka}.>
1626   <S {Bap}.> Nay, let them goe, a couple of quiet ones.
1627  *<S {Gre}.>  Went they not quickly, I should die with laugh-|(ing.
1628   <S {Tra}.> Of all mad matches neuer was the like.
1629   <S {Luc}.> Mistresse, what's your opinion of your sister?
1630   <S {Bian}.> That being mad her selfe, she's madly mated.
1631   <S {Gre}.> I warrant him {Petruchio} is Kated.
1632  *<S {Bap}.> Neighbours and friends, though Bride & Bride-|(groom wants
1633   For to supply the places at the table,
1634   You know there wants no iunkets at the feast:
1635   {Lucentio}, you shall supply the Bridegroomes place,
1636   And let {Bianca} take her sisters roome.
1637   <S {Tra}.> Shall sweet {Bianca} practise how to bride it?
1638   <S {Bap}.> She shall {Lucentio}: come gentlemen lets goe.
1639   <D {Enter Grumio}.> <D {Exeunt}.>
1640  *<S {Gru}.>  Fie, fie on all tired Iades, on all mad Masters, &
1641  *all  foule waies: was euer man so beaten? was euer man
1642  *so  raide? was euer man so weary? I am sent before to
1643  *make  a fire, and they are comming after to warme them:
1644  *now were not I a little pot, & soone hot; my very lippes
1645  *might  freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roofe of my
1646  *mouth,  my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire
1647  *to  thaw me, but I with blowing the fire shall warme my
1648  *selfe: for considering the weather, a taller man then I
1649   will take cold: Holla, hoa {Curtis}.
1650   <D {Enter Curtis}.>
1651   <S {Curt}.> Who is that calls so coldly?
1652  *<S {Gru}.>  A piece of Ice: if thou doubt it, thou maist
1653  *slide from my shoulder to my #heele, with no
      <P T3><C B>
1654  *greater a run but my head and my necke. A fire good
1655   {Curtis}.
1656   <S {Cur}.> Is my master and his wife comming {Grumio}?
1657  *<S {Gru}.> Oh #I {Curtis} #I, and therefore fire, fire, cast on no
1658   water.
1659   <S {Cur}.>  Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported.
1660  *<S {Gru}.>  She was good {Curtis} before this frost: but thou
1661  *know'st  winter tames man, woman, and beast: for it
1662  *hath  tam'd my old master, and my new mistris, and my
1663   selfe fellow {Curtis}.
1664   <S {Gru}.> Away you three inch foole, I am no beast.
1665  *<S {Gru}.>  Am I but three inches? Why thy horne is a foot
1666  *and  so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire,
1667  *or shall I complaine on thee to our mistris, whose hand
1668  *(she  being now at hand) thou shalt soone feele, to thy
1669   cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office.
1670  *<S {Cur}.>  I prethee good {Grumio}, tell me, how goes the
1671   world?
1672  *<S {Gru}.>  A cold world {Curtis} in euery office but thine, &
1673  *therefore  fire: do thy duty, and haue thy dutie, for my
1674   Master and mistris are almost frozen to death.
1675  *<S {Cur}.>  There's fire readie, and therefore good {Grumio}
1676   the newes.
1677  *<S {Gru}.>  Why Iacke boy, ho boy, and as much newes as
1678   wilt thou.
1679   <S {Cur}.> Come, you are so full of conicatching.
1680  *<S {Gru}.> Why therefore fire, for I haue caught extreme
1681  *cold.  Where's the Cooke, is supper ready, the house
1682  *trim'd, rushes strew'd, cobwebs swept, the seruingmen
1683  *in  their new fustian, the white stockings, and euery offi-cer
1684  *his  wedding garment on? Be the Iackes faire with-in,
1685  *the  Gils faire without, the Carpets laide, and euerie
1686   thing in order?
1687   <S {Cur}.> All readie: and therefore I pray thee newes.
1688  *<S {Gru}.>  First know my horse is tired, my master & mi-stris
1689   falne out. <S {Cur}.> How?
1690  *<S {Gru}.>  Out of their saddles into the durt, and thereby
1691   hangs a tale.
1692   <S {Cur}.> Let's ha't good {Grumio}.
1693   <S {Gru}.> Lend thine eare.
1694   <S {Cur}.> Heere.
1695   <S {Gru}.> There.
1696   <S {Cur}.>  This 'tis to feele a tale, not to heare a tale.
1697  *<S {Gru}.>  And therefore 'tis cal'd a sensible tale: and this
1698  *Cuffe  was but to knocke at your eare, and beseech list-ning:
1699  *now  I begin, Inprimis wee came downe a fowle
1700   hill, my Master riding behinde my Mistris.
1701   <S {Cur}.>  Both of one horse?
1702   <S {Gru}.>  What's that to thee?
1703   <S {Cur}.> Why a horse.
1704  *<S {Gru}.> Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crost me,
1705  *thou  shouldst haue heard how her horse fel, and she vn-der
1706  *her  horse: thou shouldst haue heard in how miery a
1707  *place,  how she was bemoil'd, how hee left her with the
1708  *horse  vpon her, how he beat me because her horse stum-bled,
1709  *how  she waded through the durt to plucke him off
1710  *me:  how he swore, how she prai'd, that neuer prai'd be-fore:
1711  *how  I cried, how the horses ranne away, how her
1712  *bridle  was burst: how I lost my crupper, with manie
1713  *things  of worthy memorie, which now shall die in obli-uion,
1714   and thou returne vnexperienc'd to thy graue.
1715   <S {Cur}.> By this reckning he is more shrew than she.
1716  *<S {Gru}.> #I, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
1717  *finde  when he comes home. But what talke I of this?
1718  *Call  forth {Nathaniel, Ioseph, Nicholas, Phillip, Walter, Su-gersop}
1719  *and  the rest: let their heads bee slickely comb'd,
1720  *their  blew coats brush'd, and their garters of an indiffe-rent
1721  *knit,  let them curtsie with their left legges, and not
1722  *presume to touch a haire of my Masters horse- taile, till
1723   they kisse their hands. Are they all readie?
1724   <S {Cur}.> They are.
1725   <S {Gru}.> Call them forth.
1726  *<S {Cur}.>  Do you heare ho? you must meete my maister
1727   to countenance my mistris.
1728   <S {Gru}.> Why she hath a face of her owne.
1729   <S {Cur}.> Who knowes not that?
1730  *<S {Gru}.>  Thou it seemes, that cals for company to coun-tenance
1731   her.
1732   <S {Cur}.> I call them forth to credit her.
1733   <D {Enter foure or fiue seruingmen}.>
1734   <S {Gru}.> Why she comes to borrow nothing of them.
1735   <S {Nat}.> Welcome home {Grumio}.
1736   <S {Phil}.> How now {Grumio}.
1737   <S {Ios}.> What {Grumio}.
1738   <S {Nick}.> Fellow {Grumio}.
1739   <S {Nat}.> How now old lad.
1740  *<S {Gru}.> Welcome you: how now you: what you: fel-low
1741  *you:  and thus much for greeting. Now my spruce
1742   companions, is all readie, and all things neate?
1743   <S {Nat}.> All things is readie, how neere is our master?
1744  *<S {Gre}.>  E'ne at hand, alighted by this: and therefore be
1745   not=== Cockes passion, silence, I heare my master.
1746   <D {Enter Petruchio and Kate}.>
1747  *<S {Pet}.>  Where be these knaues? What no man at doore
1748   To hold my stirrop, nor to take my horse?
1749   Where is {Nathaniel, Gregory, Phillip}.
1750   <S {All} {ser}.> Heere, heere sir, heere sir.
1751   <S {Pet}.> Heere sir, heere sir, heere sir, heere sir.
1752   You logger- headed and vnpollisht groomes:
1753   What? no attendance? no regard? no dutie?
1754   Where is the foolish knaue I sent before?
1755   <S {Gru}.> Heere sir, as foolish as I was before.
1756  *<S {Pet}.>  You pezant, swain, you horson malt- horse drudg
1757   Did I not bid thee meete me in the Parke,
1758   And bring along these rascal knaues with thee?
1759   <S {Grumio}.> {Nathaniels}  coate sir was not fully made,
1760   And {Gabrels} pumpes were all vnpinkt i'th #heele:
1761   There was no Linke to colour {Peters}  hat,
1762   And {Walters} dagger was not come from sheathing:
1763   There were none fine, but {Adam}, {Rafe}, and {Gregory},
1764   The rest were ragged, old, and beggerly,
1765   Yet as they are, heere are they come to meete you.
1766  *<S {Pet}.>  Go rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.  <D {Ex. Ser}.>
1767   Where is the life that late I led?
1768   Where are those? Sit downe {Kate},
1769   And welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud.
1770   <D {Enter seruants with supper}.>
1771   Why when I say? Nay good sweete {Kate} be merrie.
1772   Off with my boots, you rogues: you villaines, when?
1773   {It was the Friar of Orders gray},
1774   {As he forth walked on his way}.
1775   Out you rogue, you plucke my foote awrie,
1776   Take that, and mend the plucking of the other.
1777   Be merrie {Kate}: Some water heere: what hoa.
1778   <D {Enter one with water}.>
1779   Where's my Spaniel {Troilus}? Sirra, get you hence,
1780   And bid my cozen {Ferdinand}  come hither:
1781   One {Kate} that you must kisse, and be acquainted with.
1782   Where are my Slippers? Shall I haue some water?
1783   Come {Kate} and wash, & welcome heartily:
1784   You horson villaine, will you let it fall?
      <P T3v>
1785   <S {Kate}.> Patience I pray you, 'twas a fault vnwilling.
1786   <S {Pet}.> A horson beetle- headed flap- ear'd knaue:
1787   Come {Kate} sit downe, I know you haue a stomacke,
1788   Will you giue thankes, sweete {Kate}, or else shall I?
1789   What's this, Mutton?
1790   <S 1.{Ser}.> #I.
1791   <S {Pet}.> Who brought it?
1792   <S {Peter}.> I.
1793   <S {Pet}.> 'Tis burnt, and so is all the meate:
1794   What dogges are these? Where is the rascall Cooke?
1795   How durst you villaines bring it from the dresser
1796   And serue it thus to me that loue it not?
1797   There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all:
1798   You heedlesse iolt- heads, and vnmanner'd slaues.
1799   What, do you grumble? Ile be with you straight.
1800   <S {Kate}.> I pray you husband be not so disquiet,
1801   The meate was well, if you were so contented.
1802   <S {Pet}.> I tell thee {Kate}, 'twas burnt and dried away,
1803   And I expressely am forbid to touch it:
1804   For it engenders choller, planteth anger,
1805   And better 'twere that both of vs did fast,
1806   Since of our selues, our selues are chollericke,
1807   Then feede it with such ouer- rosted flesh:
1808   Be patient, to morrow't shalbe mended,
1809   And for this night #we'l  fast for companie.
1810   Come I wil bring thee to thy Bridall chamber.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1811   <D {Enter Seruants seuerally}.>
1812   <S {Nath}.> {Peter}  didst euer see the like.
1813   <S {Peter}.> He kils her in her owne humor.
1814   <S {Grumio}.> Where is he?
1815   <D {Enter Curtis a Seruant}.>
1816  *<S {Cur}.>  In her chamber, making a sermon of continen-cie
1817  *to  her, and railes, and sweares, and rates, that shee
1818  *(poore  soule) knowes not which way to stand, to looke,
1819  *to  speake, and sits as one new risen from a dreame. A-way,
1820   away, for he is comming hither.
1821   <D {Enter Petruchio}.>
1822   <S {Pet}.> Thus haue I politickely begun my reigne,
1823   And 'tis my hope to end successefully:
1824   My Faulcon now is sharpe, and passing emptie,
1825   And til she stoope, she must not be full gorg'd,
1826   For then she neuer lookes vpon her lure.
1827   Another way I haue to man my Haggard,
1828   To make her come, and know her Keepers call:
1829   That is, to watch her, as we watch these Kites,
1830   That baite, and beate, and will not be obedient:
1831   She eate no meate to day, nor none shall eate.
1832   Last night she slept not, nor to night she shall not:
1833   As with the meate, some vndeserued fault
1834   Ile finde about the making of the bed,
1835   And heere Ile fling the pillow, there the boulster,
1836   This way the Couerlet, another way the sheets:
1837   #I,  and amid this hurlie I intend,
1838   That all is done in reuerend care of her,
1839   And in conclusion, she shal watch all night,
1840   And if she chance to nod, Ile raile and brawle,
1841   And with the clamor keepe her stil awake:
1842   This is a way to kil a Wife with kindnesse,
1843   And thus Ile curbe her mad and headstrong humor:
1844   He that knowes better how to tame a shrew,
1845   Now let him speake, 'tis charity to shew.  <D {Exit}>
1846   <D {Enter Tranio and {Hortensio}.>
1847   <S {Tra}.> Is't possible friend {Lisio}, that mistris {Bianca}
1848   Doth fancie any other but {Lucentio},
1849   I tel you sir, she beares me faire in hand.
1850   <S {Luc}.> Sir, to satisfie you in what I haue said,
1851   Stand by, and marke the manner of his teaching.
1852   <D {Enter Bianca}.>
1853   <S {Hor}.> Now Mistris, profit you in what you reade?
1854  *<S {Bian}.>  What Master reade you first, resolue me that?
1855   <S {Hor}.> I reade, that I professe the #Art  to loue.
1856   <S {Bian}.> And may you proue sir Master of your #Art.
1857  *<S {Luc}.>  While you sweet deere proue Mistresse of my
1858   heart.
1859  *<S {Hor}.>  Quicke proceeders marry, now tel me I pray,
1860   you that durst sweare that your Mistris {Bianca}
1861   Lou'd me in the World so wel as {Lucentio}.
1862  *<S {Tra}.> Oh despightful Loue, vnconstant womankind,
1863   I tel thee {Lisio} this is wonderfull.
1864   <S {Hor}.> Mistake no more, I am not {Lisio},
1865   Nor a Musitian as I seeme to bee,
1866   But one that scorne to liue in this disguise,
1867   For such a one as leaues a Gentleman,
1868   And makes a God of such a Cullion;
1869   Know sir, that I am cal'd {Hortensio}.
1870   <S {Tra}.>  Signior {Hortensio}, I haue often heard
1871   Of your entire affection to {Bianca},
1872   And since mine eyes are witnesse of her lightnesse,
1873   I wil with you, if you be so contented,
1874   Forsweare {Bianca}, and her loue for euer.
1875  *<S {Hor}.>  See how they kisse and court: Signior {Lucentio},
1876   Heere is my hand, and heere I firmly vow
1877   Neuer to woo her more, but do forsweare her
1878   As one vnworthie all the former fauours
1879   That I haue fondly flatter'd them withall.
1880   <S {Tra}.> And heere I take the like vnfained oath,
1881   Neuer to marrie with her, though she would intreate,
1882   Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him.
1883  *<S {Hor}.>  Would all the world but he had quite forsworn
1884   For me, that I may surely keepe mine oath.
1885   I wil be married to a wealthy Widdow,
1886   Ere three dayes passe, which hath as long lou'd me,
1887   As I haue lou'd this proud disdainful Haggard,
1888   And so farewel signior {Lucentio},
1889   Kindnesse in women, not their beauteous lookes
1890   Shal win my loue, and so I take my leaue,
1891   In resolution, as I swore before.
1892   <S {Tra}.> Mistris {Bianca}, blesse you with such grace,
1893   As longeth to a Louers blessed case:
1894   Nay, I haue tane you napping gentle Loue,
1895   And haue forsworne you with {Hortensio}.
1896  *<S {Bian}.> {Tranio} you iest, but haue you both forsworne
1897   mee?
1898   <S {Tra}.>  Mistris we haue.
1899   <S {Luc}.> Then we are rid of {Lisio}.
1900   <S {Tra}.> I'faith hee'l haue a lustie Widdow now,
1901   That shalbe woo'd, and wedded in a day.
1902   <S {Bian}.> God giue him ioy.
1903   <S {Tra}.> #I,  #and hee'l tame her.
1904   <S {Bianca}.> He sayes so {Tranio}.
1905   <S {Tra}.> Faith he is gone vnto the taming schoole.
1906  *<S {Bian}.>  The taming schoole: what is there such a place?
1907   <S {Tra}.> #I  mistris, and {Petruchio} is the master,
1908   That teacheth trickes eleuen and twentie long,
1909   To tame a shrew, and charme her chattering tongue.
1910   <D {Enter Biondello}.>
1911   <S {Bion}.> Oh Master, master I haue watcht so long,
1912   That I am dogge- wearie, but at last I spied
1913   An ancient Angel comming downe the hill,
1914   Wil serue the turne.
1915   <S {Tra}.>  What is he {Biondello}?
1916   <S {Bio}.> Master, a Marcantant, or a pedant,
      <P T4>
1917   I know not what, but formall in apparrell,
1918   In gate and countenance surely like a Father.
1919   <S {Luc}.> And what of him {Tranio}?
1920   <S {Tra}.> If he be credulous, and trust my tale,
1921   Ile make him glad to seeme {Vincentio},
1922   And giue assurance to {Baptista Minola}.
1923   As if he were the right {Vincentio}.
1924   <S {Par}.>  Take me your loue, and then let me alone.
1925   <D {Enter a Pedant}.>
1926   <S {Ped}.> God saue you sir.
1927   <S {Tra}.> And you sir, you are welcome,
1928   Trauaile you farre on, or are you at the farthest?
1929   <S {Ped}.> Sir at the farthest for a weeke or two,
1930   But then vp farther, and as farre as Rome,
1931   And so to Tripolie, if God lend me life.
1932   <S {Tra}.> What Countreyman I pray?
1933   <S {Ped}.> Of {Mantua}.
1934   <S {Tra}.>  Of {Mantua} Sir, marrie God forbid,
1935   And come to Padua carelesse of your life.
1936   <S {Ped}.> My life sir? how I pray? for that goes hard.
1937   <S {Tra}.> 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
1938   To come to Padua, know you not the cause?
1939   Your ships are staid at Venice, and the Duke
1940   For priuate quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
1941   Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
1942   'Tis meruaile, but that you are but newly come,
1943   You might haue heard it else proclaim'd about.
1944   <S {Ped}.> Alas sir, it is worse for me then so,
1945   For I haue bils for monie by exchange
1946   From Florence, and must heere deliuer them.
1947   <S {Tra}.> Wel sir, to do you courtesie,
1948   This wil I do, and this I wil aduise you.
1949   First tell me, haue you euer beene at Pisa?
1950   <S {Ped}.> #I  sir, in Pisa haue I often bin,
1951   Pisa renowned for graue Citizens.
1952   <S {Tra}.>  Among them know you one {Vincentio}?
1953   <S {Ped}.>  I know him not, but I haue heard of him:
1954   A Merchant of incomparable wealth.
1955   <S {Tra}.> He is my father sir, and sooth to say,
1956   In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
1957  *<S {Bion}.>  As much as an apple doth an oyster, & all one.
1958   <S {Tra}.> To saue your life in this extremitie,
1959   This fauor wil I do you for his sake,
1960   And thinke it not the worst of all your fortunes,
1961   That you are like to Sir {Vincentio}.
1962   His name and credite shal you vndertake,
1963   And in my house you shal be friendly lodg'd,
1964   Looke that you take vpon you as you should,
1965   You vnderstand me sir: so shal you stay
1966   Til you haue done your businesse in the Citie:
1967   If this be court'sie sir, accept of it.
1968   <S {Ped}.> Oh sir I do, and wil repute you euer
1969   The patron of my life and libertie.
1970   <S {Tra}.> Then go with me, to make the matter good,
1971   This by the way I let you vnderstand,
1972   My father is heere look'd for euerie day,
1973   To passe assurance of a dowre in marriage
1974   'Twixt me, and one {Baptistas} daughter heere:
1975   In all these circumstances Ile instruct you,
1976   Go with me to cloath you as becomes you.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1977   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
1978   <D {Enter Katherina and Grumio}.>
1979   <S {Gru}.>  No, no forsooth I dare not for my life.
1980  *<S {Ka}.> The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
1981   What, did he marrie me to famish me?
1982   Beggers that come vnto my fathers doore,
1983   Vpon intreatie haue a present almes,
1984   If not, elsewhere they meete with charitie:
1985   But I, who neuer knew how to intreat,
1986   Nor neuer needed that I should intreate,
1987   Am staru'd for meate, giddie for lacke of sleepe:
1988   With oathes kept waking, and with brawling fed,
1989   And that which spights me more then all these wants,
1990   He does it vnder name of perfect loue:
1991   As who should say, if I should sleepe or eate
1992   'Twere deadly sicknesse, or else present death.
1993   I prethee go, and get me some repast,
1994   I care not what, so it be holsome foode.
1995   <S {Gru}.> What say you to a Neats foote?
1996   <S {Kate}.> 'Tis passing good, I prethee let me haue it.
1997   <S {Gru}.> I feare it is too chollericke a meate.
1998   How say you to a fat Tripe finely broyl'd?
1999   <S {Kate}.> I like it well, good Grumio fetch it me.
2000   <S {Gru}.> I cannot tell, I feare 'tis chollericke.
2001   What say you to a peece of Beefe and Mustard?
2002   <S {Kate}.>  A dish that I do loue to feede vpon.
2003   <S {Gru}.> #I,  but the Mustard is too hot a little.
2004  *<S {Kate}.>  Why then the Beefe, and let the Mustard rest.
2005  *<S {Gru}.>  Nay then I wil not, you shal haue the Mustard
2006   Or else you get no beefe of Grumio.
2007   <S {Kate}.> Then both or one, or any thing thou wilt.
2008   <S {Gru}.> Why then the Mustard without the beefe.
2009   <S {Kate}.> Go get thee gone, thou false deluding slaue,
2010   <D {Beats him}.>
2011   That feed'st me with the verie name of meate.
2012   Sorrow on thee, and all the packe of you
2013   That triumph thus vpon my misery:
2014   Go get thee gone, I say.
2015   <D {Enter Petruchio, and Hortensio with meate}.>
2016  *<S {Petr}.>  How fares my Kate, what sweeting all a-mort?
2017   <S {Hor}.>  Mistris, what cheere?
2018   <S {Kate}.> Faith as cold as can be.
2019  *<S {Pet}.>  Plucke vp thy spirits, looke cheerfully vpon me.
2020   Heere Loue, thou seest how diligent I am,
2021   To dresse thy meate my selfe, and bring it thee.
2022   I am sure sweet Kate, this kindnesse merites thankes.
2023   What, not a word? Nay then, thou lou'st it not:
2024   And all my paines is sorted to no proofe.
2025   Heere take away this dish.
2026   <S {Kate}.> I pray you let it stand.
2027   <S {Pet}.>  The poorest seruice is repaide with thankes,
2028   And so shall mine before you touch the meate.
2029   <S {Kate}.> I thanke you sir.
2030   <S {Hor}.>  Signior {Petruchio}, fie you are #too blame:
2031   Come Mistris Kate, Ile beare you companie.
2032   <S {Petr}.> Eate it vp all {Hortensio}, if thou louest mee:
2033   Much good do it vnto thy gentle heart:
2034   {#Kate} eate apace; and now my honie Loue,
2035   Will we returne vnto thy Fathers house,
2036   And reuell it as brauely as the best,
2037   With silken coats and caps, and golden Rings,
2038   With Ruffes and Cuffes, and Fardingales, and things:
2039  *With  Scarfes, and Fannes, & double change of brau'ry,
2040   With Amber Bracelets, Beades, and all this knau'ry.
2041   What hast thou din'd? The Tailor staies thy leasure,
2042   To decke thy bodie with his ruffling treasure.
2043   <D {Enter Tailor}.>
      <P T4v>
2044   Come Tailor, let vs see these ornaments.
2045   <D {Enter Haberdasher}.>
2046   Lay forth the gowne. What newes with you sir?
2047   <S {Fel}.> Heere is the cap your Worship did bespeake.
2048   <S {Pet}.> Why this was moulded on a porrenger,
2049   A Veluet dish: Fie, fie, 'tis lewd and filthy,
2050   Why 'tis a cockle or a walnut- shell,
2051   A knacke, a toy, a tricke, a babies cap:
2052   Away with it, come let me haue a bigger.
2053   <S {Kate}.> Ile haue no bigger, this doth fit the time,
2054   And Gentlewomen weare such caps as these.
2055   <S {Pet}.> When you are gentle, you shall haue one too,
2056   And not till then.
2057   <S {Hor}.> That will not be in #hast.
2058   <S {Kate}.> Why sir I trust I may haue leaue to speake,
2059   And speake I will. I am no childe, no babe,
2060   Your betters haue indur'd me say my minde,
2061   And if you cannot, best you stop your eares.
2062   My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
2063   Or els my heart concealing it wil breake,
2064   And rather then it shall, I will be free,
2065   Euen to the vttermost as I please in words.
2066   <S {Pet}.> Why thou saist true, it is paltrie cap,
2067   A custard coffen, a bauble, a silken pie,
2068   I loue thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
2069   <S {Kate}.> Loue me, or loue me not, I like the cap,
2070   And it I will haue, or I will haue none.
2071   <S {Pet}.> Thy gowne, why #I:  come Tailor let vs see't.
2072   Oh mercie God, what masking stuffe is heere?
2073   Whats this? a sleeue? 'tis like demi cannon,
2074   What, vp and downe caru'd like an apple Tart?
2075   Heers snip, and nip, and cut, and slish and slash,
2076   Like to a Censor in a barbers shoppe:
2077   Why what #a  deuils name Tailor cal'st thou this?
2078  *<S {Hor}.>  I see shees like to haue neither cap nor gowne.
2079   <S {Tai}.> You bid me make it orderlie and well,
2080   According to the fashion, and the time.
2081   <S {Pet}.> Marrie and did: but if you be remembred,
2082   I did not bid you marre it to the time.
2083   Go hop me ouer euery kennell home,
2084   For you shall hop without my custome sir:
2085   Ile none of it;  hence, make your best of it.
2086   <S {Kate}.> I neuer saw a better fashion'd gowne,
2087   More queint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
2088   Belike you meane to make a puppet of me.
2089  *<S {Pet}.>  Why true, he meanes to make a puppet of thee.
2090   <S {Tail}.> She saies your Worship meanes to make a
2091   puppet of her.
2092   <S {Pet}.> Oh monstrous arrogance:
2093   Thou lyest, thou thred, thou thimble,
2094   Thou yard three quarters, halfe yard, quarter, naile,
2095   Thou Flea, thou Nit, thou winter cricket thou:
2096   Brau'd in mine owne house with a skeine of thred:
2097   Away thou Ragge, thou quantitie, thou remnant,
2098   Or I shall so be- mete thee with thy yard,
2099   As thou shalt thinke on prating whil'st thou liu'st:
2100   I tell thee I, that thou hast marr'd her gowne.
2101   <S {Tail}.>  Your worship is deceiu'd, the gowne is made
2102   Iust as my master had direction:
2103   {#Grumio} gaue order how it should be done.
2104   <S {Gru}.> I gaue him no order, I gaue him the stuffe.
2105   <S {Tail}.> But how did you desire it should be made?
2106   <S {Gru}.> Marrie sir with needle and thred.
2107   <S {Tail}.>  But did you not request to haue it cut?
2108   <S {Gru}.> Thou hast fac'd many things.
2109   <S {Tail}.> I haue.
2110  *<S {Gru}.>  Face not mee: thou hast brau'd manie men,
2111  *braue not me; I will neither bee fac'd nor brau'd. I say
2112  *vnto  thee, I bid thy Master cut out the gowne, but I did
2113   not bid him cut it to peeces. Ergo thou liest.
2114  *<S {Tail}.>  Why heere is the note of the fashion to testify.
2115   <S {Pet}.> Reade it.
2116   <S {Gru}.> The note lies in's throate if he say I said so.
2117   <S {Tail}.> Inprimis, a loose bodied gowne.
2118  *<S {Gru}.> Master, if euer I said loose- bodied gowne, sow
2119  *me  in the skirts of it, and beate me to death with a bot-tome
2120   of browne thred: I said a gowne.
2121   <S {Pet}.> Proceede.
2122   <S {Tai}.> With a small compast cape.
2123   <S {Gru}.> I confesse the cape.
2124   <S {Tai}.> With a trunke sleeue.
2125   <S {Gru}.>  I confesse two sleeues.
2126   <S {Tai}.> The sleeues curiously cut.
2127   <S {Pet}.> #I  there's the villanie.
2128  *<S {Gru}.>  Error i'th bill sir, error i'th bill? I commanded
2129  *the  sleeues should be cut out, and sow'd vp againe, and
2130  *that  Ile proue vpon thee, though thy little finger be ar-med
2131   in a thimble.
2132  *<S {Tail}.>  This is true that I say, #and I had thee in place
2133   where thou shouldst know it.
2134  *<S {Gru}.>  I am for thee straight: take thou the bill, giue
2135   me thy meat- yard, and spare not me.
2136  *<S {Hor}.> God- a- mercie {Grumio}, then hee shall haue no
2137   oddes.
2138   <S {Pet}.> Well sir in breefe the gowne is not for me.
2139   <S {Gru}.> You are i'th right sir, 'tis for my mistris.
2140   <S {Pet}.> Go take it vp vnto thy masters vse.
2141  *<S {Gru}.>  Villaine, not for thy life: Take vp my Mistresse
2142   gowne for thy masters vse.
2143   <S {Pet}.> Why sir, what's your conceit in that?
2144  *<S {Gru}.>  Oh sir, the conceit is deeper then you think for:
2145   Take vp my Mistris gowne to his masters vse.
2146   Oh fie, fie, fie.
2147   <S {Pet}.> {Hortensio}, say thou wilt see the Tailor paide:
2148   Go take it hence, be gone, and say no more.
2149  *<S {Hor}.>  Tailor, Ile pay thee for thy gowne to morrow,
2150   Take no vnkindnesse of his hastie words:
2151   Away I say, commend me to thy master.  <D {Exit Tail}.>
2152  *<S {Pet}.> Well, come my {Kate}, we will vnto your fathers,
2153   Euen in these honest meane habiliments:
2154   Our purses shall be proud, our garments poore:
2155   For 'tis the minde that makes the bodie rich.
2156   And as the Sunne breakes through the darkest clouds,
2157   So honor peereth in the meanest habit.
2158   What is the Iay more precious then the Larke?
2159   Because his feathers are more beautifull.
2160   Or is the Adder better then the Eele,
2161   Because his painted skin contents the eye.
2162   Oh no good {Kate}: neither art thou the worse
2163   For this poore furniture, and meane array.
2164   If thou accountedst it shame, lay it on me,
2165   And therefore frolicke, we will hence forthwith,
2166   To feast and sport vs at thy fathers house,
2167   Go call my men, and let vs straight to him,
2168   And bring our horses vnto Long- lane end,
2169   There wil we mount, and thither walke on foote,
2170   Let's see, I thinke 'tis now some seuen #a  clocke,
2171   And well we may come there by dinner time.
2172   <S {Kate}.> I dare assure you sir, 'tis almost two,
2173   And 'twill be supper time ere you come there.
2174   <S {Pet}.> It shall be seuen ere I go to horse:
2175   Looke what I speake, or do, or thinke to doe,
      <P T5><C D>
2176   You are still crossing it, sirs let't alone,
2177   I will not goe to day, and ere I doe,
2178   It shall be what #a clock I say it is.
2179   <S {Hor}.> Why so this gallant will command the sunne.
2180   <D {Enter Tranio, and the Pedant drest like Vincentio}.>
2181   <S {Tra}.> Sirs, this is the house, please it you that I call.
2182   <S {Ped}.> #I what else, and but I be deceiued,
2183   Signior {Baptista} may remember me
2184   Neere twentie yeares #a goe in {Genoa}.
2185   <S {Tra}.> Where we were lodgers, at the {Pegasus},
2186   Tis well, and hold your owne in any case
2187   With such austeritie as longeth to a father.
2188   <D {Enter Biondello}.>
2189   <S {Ped}.> I warrant you: but sir here comes your boy,
2190   'Twere good he were school'd.
2191   <S {Tra}.> Feare you not him: sirra {Biondello},
2192   Now doe your dutie throughlie I aduise you:
2193   Imagine 'twere the right {Vincentio}.
2194   <S {Bion}.> Tut, feare not me.
2195   <S {Tra}.> But hast thou done thy errand to {Baptista}.
2196   <S {Bion}.> I told him that your father was at {Venice},
2197   And that you look't for him this day in {Padua},
2198   <S {Tra}.> Th'art a tall fellow, hold thee that to drinke,
2199   Here comes {Baptista}: set your countenance sir.
2200   <D {Enter Baptista and Lucentio: Pedant booted}
2201   {and bare headed}.>
2202   <S {Tra}.> Signior {Baptista} you are happilie met:
2203   Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of,
2204   I pray you stand good father to  me now,
2205   Giue me {Bianca} for my patrimony.
2206  *<S {Ped}.> Soft son: sir by your leaue, hauing com to {Padua}
2207   To gather in some debts, my son {Lucentio}
2208   Made me acquainted with a waighty cause
2209   Of  loue betweene your daughter and himselfe:
2210   And for the good report I heare of you,
2211   And for the loue he beareth to your daughter,
2212   And she to him: to stay him not too long,
2213   I am content in a good fathers care
2214   To haue him matcht, and if you please to like
2215   No worse then I, vpon some agreement
2216   Me shall you finde readie and willing
2217   With one consent to haue her so bestowed:
2218   For curious I cannot be with you
2219   Signior {Baptista}, of whom I heare so well.
2220   <S {Bap}.> Sir, pardon me in what I haue to say,
2221   Your plainnesse and your shortnesse please me well:
2222   Right true it is your sonne {Lucentio} here
2223   Doth loue my daughter, and she loueth him,
2224   Or both dissemble deepely their affections:
2225   And therefore if you say no more then this,
2226   That like a Father you will deale with him,
2227   And passe my daughter a sufficient dower,
2228   The match is made, and all is done,
2229   Your sonne shall haue my daughter with consent.
2230  *<S {Tra}.> I thanke you sir, where then doe you know best
2231   We be affied and such assurance tane,
2232   As shall with either parts agreement stand.
2233   <S {Bap}.> Not in my house {Lucentio}, for you know
2234   Pitchers haue eares, and I haue manie seruants,
2235   Besides old {Gremio} is harkning still,
2236   And happilie we might be interrupted.
2237   <S {Tra}.> Then at my lodging, #and it like you,
2238   There doth my father lie: and there this night
2239   Weele passe the businesse priuately and well:
2240   Send for your daughter by your seruant here,
2241   My Boy shall fetch the Scriuener presentlie,
2242   The worst is this that at so slender warning,
2243   You are like to haue a thin and slender pittance.
2244   <S {Bap}.> It likes me well:
2245  *{Cambio} hie you home, and bid {Bianca} make her readie
2246   straight:
2247   And if you will tell what hath hapned,
2248   {Lucentios} Father is arriued in {Padua},
2249   And how she's like to be {Lucentios} wife.
2250   <S {Biond}.> I praie the gods she may withall  my heart.
2251   <D {Exit}.>
2252   <S {Tran}.> Dallie not with the gods, but get thee gone.
2253   <D {Enter Peter}.>
2254   Signior {Baptista}, shall I leade the way,
2255   Welcome, one messe is like to be your cheere,
2256   Come sir, we will better it in {Pisa}.
2257   <S {Bap}.> I follow you. <D {Exeunt}.>
2258   <D {Enter Lucentio and Biondello}.>
2259   <S {Bion}.> {Cambio}.
2260   <S {Luc}.> What saist thou {Biondello}.
2261  *<S {Biond}.> You saw my Master winke and laugh vpon
2262   you?
2263   <S {Luc}.> {Biondello}, what of that?
2264  *<S {Biond}.> Faith nothing: but #has left mee here behinde
2265  *to expound the meaning  or morrall of his signes and to-kens.
2266  _
2267   <S {Luc}.> I pray thee moralize them.
2268  *<S {Biond}.> Then thus: {Baptista} is safe talking with the
2269   deceiuing Father of a deceitfull sonne.
2270   <S {Luc}.> And what of him?
2271  *<S {Biond}.> His daughter is to be brought by you to the
2272   supper.
2273   <S {Luc}.> And then.
2274  *<S {Bio}.> The old Priest at Saint {Lukes} Church is at your
2275   command at all houres.
2276   <S {Luc}.> And what of all this.
2277  *<S {Bion}.> I cannot tell, expect they are busied about a
2278  *counterfeit assurance:  take you assurance of her, {Cum}
2279  *{preuilegio ad Impremendum solem}, to th' Church take the
2280   Priest, Clarke, and some sufficient honest witnesses:
2281   If this be not that you looke for, I haue no more to say,
2282   But bid {Bianca} farewell for euer and a day.
2283   <S {Luc}.> Hear'st thou {Biondello}.
2284  *<S {Biond}.> I cannot tarry: I knew a wench maried in an
2285  *afternoone as shee went to the Garden for Parseley to
2286  *stuffe a Rabit, and so may you sir: and so adew sir, my
2287  *Master hath appointed me to goe to Saint {Lukes} to bid
2288  *the Priest be readie to come against you come with your
2289   appendix.  <D {Exit}.>
2290   <S {Luc}.> I may and will, if she be so contented:
2291   She will be pleas'd, then wherefore should I doubt:
2292   Hap what hap may, Ile roundly goe about her:
2293   It shall goe hard if {Cambio} goe without her.  <D {Exit}.>
2294   <D {Enter Petruchio, Kate, Hortentio}>
2295  *<S {Petr}.> Come on #a Gods name, once more toward our
2296   fathers:
2297   Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the Moone.
2298  *<S {Kate}.> The Moone, the Sunne: it is not Moonelight
2299   now.
2300   <S {Pet}.> I say it is the Moone that shines so bright.
2301   <S {Kate}.> I know it is the Sunne that shines so bright.
2302  *<S {Pet}.> Now by my mothers sonne, and that's my selfe,
      <P T5v>
2303   It shall be moone, or starre, or what I list,
2304   Or ere I iourney to your Fathers house:
2305   Goe on, and fetch our horses backe againe,
2306   Euermore crost and crost, nothing but crost.
2307   <S {Hort}.> Say as he saies, or we shall neuer goe.
2308   <S {Kate}.> Forward I pray, since we haue come so farre,
2309   And be it moone, or sunne, or what you please:
2310   And if you please to call it a rush Candle,
2311   Henceforth I vowe it shall be so for me.
2312   <S {Petr}.> I say it is the Moone.
2313   <S {Kate}.> I know it is the Moone.
2314   <S {Petr}.>  Nay then you lye: it is the blessed Sunne.
2315   <S {Kate}.> Then God be blest, it is the blessed sun,
2316   But sunne it is not, when you say it is not,
2317   And the Moone changes euen as your minde:
2318   What you will haue it nam'd, euen that it is,
2319   And so it shall be so for {Katherine}.
2320   <S {Hort}.> {Petruchio},  goe thy waies, the field is won.
2321  *<S {Petr}.>  Well, forward, forward, thus the bowle should |(run,
2322   And not vnluckily against the Bias:
2323   But soft, Company is comming here.
2324   <D {Enter Vincentio}.>
2325   Good morrow gentle Mistris, where away:
2326   Tell me sweete {Kate},  and tell me truely too,
2327   Hast thou beheld a fresher Gentlewoman:
2328   Such warre of white and red within her cheekes:
2329   What stars do spangle heauen with such beautie,
2330   As those two eyes become that heauenly face?
2331   Faire louely Maide, once more good day to thee:
2332   Sweete {Kate} embrace her for her beauties sake.
2333  *<S {Hort}.> #A will make the man mad to make the woman
2334   of him.
2335  *<S {Kate}.>  Yong budding Virgin, faire, and fresh, & sweet,
2336   Whether away, or whether is thy aboade?
2337   Happy the Parents of so faire a childe;
2338   Happier the man whom fauourable stars
2339   #A lots thee for his louely bedfellow.
2340  *<S {Petr}.>  Why how now {Kate}, I hope thou art not mad,
2341   This is a man old, wrinckled, faded, withered,
2342   And not a Maiden, as thou saist he is.
2343   <S {Kate}.> Pardon old father my mistaking eies,
2344   That haue bin so bedazled with the sunne,
2345   That euery thing I looke on seemeth greene:
2346   Now I perceiue thou art a reuerent Father:
2347   Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking.
2348  *<S {Petr}.>  Do good old grandsire, & withall make known
2349   Which way thou trauellest, if along with vs,
2350   We shall be ioyfull of thy companie.
2351   <S {Vin}.> Faire Sir, and you my merry Mistris,
2352   That with your strange encounter much amasde me:
2353   My name is call'd {Vincentio}, my dwelling {Pisa},
2354   And bound I am to {Padua}, there to visite
2355   A sonne of mine, which long I haue not seene.
2356   <S {Petr}.> What is his name?
2357   <S {Vinc}.> {Lucentio} gentle sir.
2358   <S {Petr}.> Happily met, the happier for thy sonne:
2359   And now by Law, as well as reuerent age,
2360   I may intitle thee my louing Father,
2361   The sister to my wife, this Gentlewoman,
2362   Thy Sonne by this hath married: wonder not,
2363   Nor be not grieued, she is of good esteeme,
2364   Her dowrie wealthie, and of worthie birth;
2365   Beside, so qualified, as may  beseeme
2366   The Spouse of any noble Gentleman:
2367   Let me imbrace with old {Vincentio},
2368   And wander we to see thy honest sonne,
2369   Who will of thy arriuall be full ioyous.
2370   <S {Vinc}.> But is this true, or is it else your pleasure,
2371   Like pleasant trauailors to breake a Iest
2372   Vpon the companie you ouertake?
2373   <S {Hort}.> I doe assure thee father so it is.
2374   <S {Petr}.> Come goe along and see the truth hereof,
2375   For our first merriment hath made thee iealous.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2376   <S {Hor}.> Well {Petruchio}, this has put me in heart;
2377   Haue to my Widdow, and if she froward,
2378   Then hast thou taught {Hortentio} to be vntoward.  <D {Exit}.>

2380   {is out before}.>
2381   <S {Biond}.> Softly and swiftly sir, for the Priest is ready.
2382  *<S {Luc}.> I flie {Biondello}; but they may chance to neede
2383   thee at home, therefore leaue vs.  <D {Exit}.>
2384  *<S {Biond}.> Nay faith, Ile see the Church #a your backe,
2385   and then come backe to my mistris as soone as I can.
2386   <S {Gre}.> I maruaile {Cambio} comes not all this while.

2399   the gate?
2400   <S {Vin}.> Is Signior {Lucentio} within sir?
2401   <S {Ped}.> He's within sir, but not to be spoken withall.
2402  *<S {Vinc}.> What if a man bring him a hundred pound or
2403   two to make merrie withall.
2404  *<S {Ped}.> Keepe your hundred pounds to your selfe, hee
2405   shall neede none so long as I liue.

2501   That fac'd and braued me in this matter so?
2502   <S {Bap}.> Why, tell me is not this my {Cambio}?
2503   <S {Bian}.> {Cambio}  is chang'd into {Lucentio}.
2504   <S {Luc}.>  Loue wrought these miracles. {Biancas} loue
2505   Made me exchange my state with {Tranio},
2506   While he did beare my countenance in the towne,
2507   And happilie I haue arriued at the last
2508   Vnto the wished hauen of my blisse:
2509   What {Tranio}  did, my selfe enforst him to;
2510   Then pardon him sweete Father for my sake.
2511  *<S {Vin}.>  Ile slit the villaines nose that would haue sent
2512   me to the Iaile.
2513  *<S {Bap}.>  But doe you heare sir, haue you married my
2514   daughter without asking my good #will?
2515  *<S {Vin}.>  Feare not {Baptista}, we will content you, goe to:
2516   but I will in to be reueng'd for this villanie.  <D {Exit}.>
2517  *<S {Bap}.>  And I to sound the depth of this knauerie.  <D {Exit}.>
2518  *<S {Luc}.>  Looke not pale {Bianca}, thy father will not frown.
2519   <D {Exeunt}.>
2520   <S {Gre}.> My cake is dough, but Ile in among the rest,
2521   Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
2522  *<S {Kate}.>  Husband let's follow, to see the end of this adoe.
2523   <S {Petr}.> First kisse me {Kate}, and we will.
2524   <S {Kate}.> What in the midst of the streete?
2525   <S {Petr}.> What art thou asham'd of me?
2526   <S {Kate}.> No sir, God forbid, but asham'd to kisse.
2527  *<S {Petr}.>  Why then let's home againe: Come Sirra let's
2528   awaie.
2529  *<S {Kate}.>  Nay, I will giue thee a kisse, now praie thee
2530   Loue staie.
2531   <S {Petr}.> Is not this well? come my sweete {Kate}.
2532   Better once then neuer, for neuer #to late.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2533   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2534  *<D {Enter  Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, and}
2535   {Bianca. Tranio, Biondello Grumio, and Widdow:}
2536   {The Seruingmen with Tranio bringing}
2537   {in a Banquet}.>
2538   <S {Luc}.> At last, though long, our iarring notes agree,
2539   And time it is when raging warre is come,
2540   To smile at scapes and perils ouerblowne:
2541   My faire {Bianca} bid my father welcome,
2542   While I with selfesame kindnesse welcome thine:
2543   Brother {Petruchio}, sister {Katerina},
2544   And thou {Hortentio} with thy louing {Widdow}:
2545   Feast with the best, and welcome to my house,
2546   My Banket is to close our stomakes vp
2547   After our great good cheere: praie you sit downe,
2548   For now we sit to chat as well as eate.
2549   <S {Petr}.> Nothing but sit and sit, and eate and eate.
2550   <S {Bap}.> {Padua} affords this kindnesse, sonne {Petruchio}.
2551   <S {Petr}.> {Padua}  affords nothing but what is kinde.
2552  *<S {Hor}.>  For both our sakes I would that word were true.
2553   <S {Pet}.> Now for my life {Hortentio} feares his Widow.
2554   <S {Wid}.> Then neuer trust me if I be affeard.
2555  *<S {Petr}.>  You are verie sencible, and yet you misse my
2556   sence:
2557   I meane {Hortentio} is afeard of you.
      <P T6v>
2558  *<S {Wid}.> He that is giddie thinks the world turns round.
2559   <S {Petr}.> Roundlie replied.
2560   <S {Kat}.> Mistris, how meane you that?
2561   <S {Wid}.> Thus I conceiue by him.
2562   <S {Petr}.> Conceiues by me, how likes {Hortentio} that?
2563   <S {Hor}.> My Widdow saies, thus she conceiues her tale.
2564  *<S {Petr}.>  Verie well mended: kisse him for that good
2565   Widdow.
2566  *<S {Kat}.>  He that is giddie thinkes the world turnes round,
2567   I praie you tell me what you meant by that.
2568   <S {Wid}.> Your housband being troubled with a shrew,
2569   Measures my husbands sorrow by his woe:
2570   And now you know my meaning.
2571   <S {Kate}.> A verie meane meaning.
2572   <S {Wid}.> Right, I meane you.
2573   <S {Kat}.> And I am meane indeede, respecting you.
2574   <S {Petr}.> To her {Kate}.
2575   <S {Hor}.> To her {Widdow}.
2576  *<S {Petr}.> A hundred marks, my {Kate} does put her down.
2577   <S {Hor}.> That's my office
2578   <S {Petr}.> Spoke like an Officer: #ha to #the lad.
2579   <D {Drinkes to Hortentio}.>
2580   <S {Bap}.> How likes {Gremio} these quicke witted folkes?
2581   <S {Gre}.> Beleeue me sir, they #But  together well.
2582   <S {Bian}.> Head, #and but  an hastie witted bodie,
2583   Would say your Head #and #But  were head and horne.
2584   <S {Vin}.> #I  Mistris Bride, hath that awakened you?
2585  *<S {Bian}.> #I, but not frighted me, therefore Ile sleepe a-gaine.
2586  _
2587  *<S {Petr}.>  Nay that you shall not since you haue begun:
2588   Haue at you for a better iest or #too.
2589   <S {Bian}.> Am I your Bird, I meane to shift my bush,
2590   And then pursue me as you draw your Bow.
2591   You are welcome all.  <D {Exit Bianca}.>
2592   <S {Petr}.> She hath preuented me, here signior {Tranio},
2593   This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not,
2594   Therefore a health to all that shot and mist.
2595   <S {Tri}.> Oh sir, {Lucentio} slipt me like his Gray- hound,
2596   Which runs himselfe, and catches for his Master.
2597   <S {Petr}.> A good swift simile, but something currish.
2598   <S {Tra}.> 'Tis well sir that you hunted for your selfe:
2599   'Tis thought your Deere does hold you at a baie.
2600   <S {Bap}.> Oh, oh {Petruchio}, {Tranio} hits you now.
2601   <S {Luc}.> I thanke thee for that gird good {Tranio}.
2602   <S {Hor}.> Confesse, confesse, hath he not hit you here?
2603   <S {Petr}.> #A  has a little gald me I confesse:
2604   And as the Iest did glaunce awaie from me,
2605   'Tis ten to one it maim'd you #too out right.
2606   <S {Bap}.> Now in good sadnesse sonne {Petruchio},
2607   I thinke thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
2608   <S {Petr}.> Well, I say no: and therefore sir assurance,
2609   Let's each one send vnto his wife,
2610   And he whose wife is most obedient,
2611   To come at first when he doth send for her,
2612   Shall win the wager which we will propose.
2613   <S {Hort}.> Content, what's the wager?
2614   <S {Luc}.> Twentie crownes.
2615   <S {Petr}.> Twentie crownes,
2616   Ile venture so much of my Hawke or Hound,
2617   But twentie times so much vpon my Wife.
2618   <S {Luc}.> A hundred then.
2619   <S {Hor}.> Content.
2620   <S {Petr}.> A match, 'tis done.
2621   <S {Hor}.> Who shall begin?
2622   <S {Luc}.> That will I.
2623   Goe {Biondello},  bid your Mistris come to me.
2624   <S {Bio}.> I goe.  <D {Exit}.>
2625   <S {Bap}.> Sonne, Ile be your halfe, {Bianca} comes.
2626   <S {Luc}.> Ile haue no halues: Ile beare it all my selfe.
2627   <D {Enter Biondello}.>
2628   How now, what newes?
2629   <S {Bio}.> Sir, my Mistris sends you word
2630   That she is busie, and she cannot come.
2631  *<S {Petr}.>  How? she's busie, and she cannot come: is that
2632   an answere?
2633   <S {Gre}.> #I,  and a kinde one too:
2634   Praie God sir your wife send you not a worse.
2635   <S {Petr}.> I hope better.
2636  *<S {Hor}.>  Sirra {Biondello}, goe and intreate my wife to
2637   come to me forthwith.  <D {Exit. Bion}.>
2638  *<S {Pet}.>  Oh ho, intreate her, nay then shee must needes
2639   come.
2640   <S {Hor}.> I am affraid sir, doe what you can
2641   <D {Enter Biondello}.>
2642   Yours will not be entreated: Now, where's my wife?
2643   <S {Bion}.> She saies you haue some goodly Iest in hand,
2644   She will not come: she bids you come to her.
2645   <S {Petr}.> Worse and worse, she will not come:
2646   Oh vilde, intollerable, not to be indur'd:
2647   Sirra {Grumio}, goe to your Mistris,
2648   Say I command her come to me.  <D {Exit}.>
2649   <S {Hor}.> I know her answere.
2650   <S {Pet}.> What?
2651   <S {Hor}.> She will not.
2652   <S {Petr}.> The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
2653   <D {Enter Katerina}.>
2654   <S {Bap}.> Now by my hollidam here comes {Katerina}.
2655   <S {Kat}.> What is your #will  sir, that you send for me?
2656   <S {Petr}.> Where is your sister, and {Hortensios} wife?
2657   <S {Kate}.> They sit conferring by the Parler fire.
2658   <S {Petr}.> Goe fetch them hither, if they denie to come,
2659   Swinge me them soundly forth vnto their husbands:
2660   Away I say, and bring them hither straight.
2661   <S {Luc}.> Here is a wonder, if you talke of a wonder.
2662   <S {Hor}.> And so it is: I wonder what it boads.
2663  *<S {Petr}.>  Marrie peace it boads, and loue, and quiet life,
2664   An awfull rule, and right supremicie:
2665   And to be short, what not, that's sweete and happie.
2666   <S {Bap}.> Now faire befall thee good {Petruchio};
2667   The wager thou hast won, and I will adde
2668   Vnto their losses twentie thousand crownes,
2669   Another dowrie to another daughter,
2670   For she is chang'd as she had neuer bin.
2671   <S {Petr}.> Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
2672   And show more signe of her obedience,
2673   Her new built vertue and obedience.
2674   <D {Enter Kate, Bianca, and Widdow}.>
2675   See where she comes, and brings your froward Wiues
2676   As prisoners to her womanlie perswasion:
2677   {Katerine}, that Cap of yours becomes you not,
2678   Off with that bable, throw it vnderfoote.
2679   <S {Wid}.> Lord let me neuer haue a cause to sigh,
2680   Till I be brought to such a sillie passe.
2681   <S {Bian}.> Fie what a foolish dutie call you this?
2682   <S {Luc}.> I would your dutie were as foolish too:
2683   The wisdome of your dutie faire {Bianca},
2684   Hath cost me fiue hundred crownes since supper time.
2685   <S {Bian}.> The more foole you for laying on my dutie.
2686  *<S {Pet}.>  {Katherine} I charge thee tell these head- strong
2687  *women,  what dutie they doe owe their Lords and hus-bands.
2688  _
      <P V1><C B>
2689  *<S {Wid}.> Come, come, #your mocking: we will haue no
2690   telling.
2691   <S {Pet}.> Come on I say, and first begin with her.
2692   <S {Wid}.> She shall not.
2693   <S {Pet}.> I say she shall, and first begin with her.
2694  *<S {Kate}.> Fie, fie, vnknit that threatning vnkinde brow,
2695   And dart not scornefull glances from those eies,
2696   To wound thy Lord, thy King, thy Gouernour.
2697   It blots thy beautie, as frosts doe bite the Meads,
2698  *Confounds thy fame, as whirlewinds shake faire budds,
2699   And in no sence is meete or amiable.
2700   A woman mou'd, is like a fountaine troubled,
2701   Muddie, #ill seeming, thicke, bereft of beautie,
2702   And while it is so, none so dry or thirstie
2703   Will daigne to sip, or touch one drop of it.
2704   Thy husband is thy Lord, thy life, thy keeper,
2705   Thy head, thy soueraigne: One that cares for thee,
2706   And for thy maintenance. Commits his body
2707   To painfull labour, both by sea and land:
2708   To watch the night in stormes, the day in cold,
2709   Whil'st thou ly'st warme at home, secure and safe,
2710   And craues no other tribute at thy hands,
2711   But loue, faire lookes, and true obedience;
2712   Too little payment for so great a debt.
2713   Such dutie as the subiect owes the Prince,
2714   Euen such a woman oweth to her husband:
2715   And when she is froward, peeuish, sullen, sowre,
2716   And not obedient to his honest #will,
2717   What is she but a foule contending Rebell,
2718   And gracelesse Traitor to her louing Lord?
2719   I am asham'd that women are so simple,
2720   To offer warre, where they should kneele for peace:
2721   Or seeke for rule, supremacie, and sway,
2722   When they are bound to serue, loue, and obay.
2723   Why are our bodies soft, and weake, and smooth,
2724   Vnapt to toyle and trouble in the world,
2725   But that our soft conditions, and our harts,
2726   Should well agree with our externall parts?
2727   Come, come, you froward and vnable wormes,
2728   My minde hath bin as bigge as one of yours,
2729   My heart as great, my reason haplie more,
2730   To bandie word for word, and frowne for frowne;
2731   But now I see our Launces are but strawes:
2732   Our strength as weake, our weakenesse past compare,
2733   That seeming to be most, which we indeed least are.
2734   Then vale your stomackes, for it is no boote,
2735   And place your hands below your husbands foote:
2736   In token of which dutie, if he please,
2737   My hand is readie, may it do him ease.
2738  *<S {Pet}.> Why there's a wench: Come on, and kisse mee
2739   {Kate}.
2740  *<S {Luc}.> Well go thy waies olde Lad for thou shalt ha't.
2741  *<S {Vin}.> Tis a good hearing, when children are toward.
2742  *<S {Luc}.> But a harsh hearing, when women are froward,
2743   <S {Pet}.> Come {Kate}, wee'le to bed,
2744   We three are married, but you two are sped.
2745   'Twas I wonne the wager, though you hit the white,
2746   And being a winner, God giue you good night.
2747   <D {Exit Petruchio}>
2748  *<S {Horten}.> Now goe thy wayes, thou hast tam'd a curst
2749   Shrow.
2750  *<S {Luc}.> Tis a wonder, by your leaue, she wil be tam'd so.
2751   <Z FINIS.
