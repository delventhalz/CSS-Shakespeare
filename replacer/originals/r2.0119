2      <D {Enter King Richard, Iohn of Gaunt, with other Nobles}
3      {and Attendants}.>
4      <S {King} {Richard}.>
5      Old {Iohn of Gaunt}, time- honoured Lancaster,
6      Hast thou according to thy oath and band
7     *Brought hither {Henry} Herford thy bold son:
8     *Heere to make good y boistrous late appeale,
9      Which then our leysure would not let vs heare,
10     Against the Duke of Norfolke, {Thomas Mowbray}?
11     <S {Gaunt}.> I haue my Liege.
12     <S {King}.> Tell me moreouer, hast thou sounded him,
13     If he appeale the Duke on ancient malice,
14     Or worthily as a good subiect should
15     On some knowne ground of treacherie in him.
16    *<S {Gaunt}.> As neere as I could sift him on that argument,
17     On some apparant danger seene in him,
18     Aym'd at your Highnesse, no inueterate malice.
19     <S {Kin}.> Then call them to our presence face to face,
20     And frowning brow to brow, our selues will heare
21     Th' accuser, and the accused, freely speake;
22     High stomack'd are they both, and full of ire,
23     In rage, deafe as the sea; hastie as fire.
24     <D {Enter Bullingbrooke and Mowbray}.>
25     <S {Bul}.> Many yeares of happy dayes befall
26     My gracious Soueraigne, my most louing Liege.
27     <S {Mow}.> Each day still better others happinesse,
28     Vntill the heauens enuying earths good hap,
29     Adde an immortall title to your Crowne.
30     <S {King}.> We thanke you both, yet one but flatters vs,
31     As well appeareth by the cause you come,
32     Namely, to appeale each other of high treason.
33     Coosin of Hereford, what dost thou obiect
34     Against the Duke of Norfolke, {Thomas Mowbray}?
35     <S {Bul}.> First, heauen be the record to my speech,
36     In the deuotion of a subiects loue,
37     Tendering the precious safetie of my Prince,
38     And free from other misbegotten hate,
39     Come I appealant to this Princely presence.
40     Now {Thomas Mowbray} do I turne to thee,
41     And marke my greeting well: for what I speake,
42     My body shall make good vpon this earth,
43     Or my diuine soule answer it in heauen.
44     Thou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant;
45     Too good to be so, and too bad to liue,
46     Since the more faire and christall is the skie,
47     The vglier seeme the cloudes that in it flye:
48     Once more, the more to aggrauate the note,
49     With a foule Traitors name stuffe I thy throte,
50     And wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue,
51    *What my tong speaks, my right drawn sword may proue
52    *<S {Mow}.> Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale:
53     'Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,
54     The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
55     Can arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine:
56     The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.
57     Yet can I not of such tame patience boast,
58     As to be husht, and nought at all to say.
59     First the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbes mee,
60     From giuing reines and spurres to my free speech,
61     Which else would post, vntill it had return'd
62     These tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat.
63     Setting aside his high bloods royalty,
64     And let him be no Kinsman to my Liege,
65     I do defie him, and I spit at him,
66     Call him a slanderous Coward, and a Villaine:
67     Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,
68     And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,
69     Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,
70     Or any other ground inhabitable,
71     Where euer Englishman durst set his foote.
72     Meane time, let this defend my loyaltie,
73     By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie.
74    *<S {Bul}.> Pale trembling Coward, there I throw my gage,
75     Disclaiming heere the kindred of a King,
76     And lay aside my high bloods Royalty,
77     Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except.
78     If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength,
79     As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then stoope.
80     By that, and all the rites of Knight- hood else,
81     Will I make good against thee arme to arme,
82     What I haue spoken, or thou canst deuise.
83     <S {Mow}.> I take it vp, and by that sword I sweare,
84     Which gently laid my Knight- hood on my shoulder,
85     Ile answer thee in any faire degree,
86     Or Chiualrous designe of knightly triall:
87     And when I mount, aliue may I not light,
88     If I be Traitor, or vniustly fight.
89    *<S {King}.> What doth our Cosin lay to {Mowbraies} charge?
90     It must be great that can inherite vs,
91     So much as of a thought of #ill in him.
92     <S {Bul}.> Looke what I said, my life shall proue it true,
93     That {Mowbray} hath receiu'd eight thousand Nobles,
      <P b6v>
94     In name of lendings for your Highnesse Soldiers,
95     The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
96     Like a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine.
97     Besides I say, and will in battaile proue,
98     Or heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge
99     That euer was suruey'd by English eye,
100    That all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres
101    Complotted, and contriued in this Land,
102    Fetch'd from false {Mowbray} their first head and spring.
103    Further I say, and further will maintaine
104    Vpon his bad life, to make all this good.
105    That he did plot the Duke of Glousters death,
106    Suggest his soone beleeuing aduersaries,
107    And consequently, like a Traitor Coward,
108   *Sluc'd out his innocent soule through streames of blood:
109    Which blood, like sacrificing {Abels} cries,
110    (Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth)
111    To me for iustice, and rough chasticement:
112    And by the glorious worth of my discent,
113    This arme shall do it, or this life be spent.
114    <S {King}.> How high a pitch his resolution soares:
115    {Thomas} of Norfolke, what sayest thou to this?
116    <S {Mow}.> Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face,
117    And bid his eares a little while be deafe,
118    Till I haue told this slander of his blood,
119    How God, and good men, hate so foule a lyar.
120    <S {King}.> {Mowbray}, impartiall are our eyes and eares,
121    Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre,
122    As he is but my fathers brothers sonne;
123    Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow,
124    Such neighbour- neerenesse to our sacred blood,
125    Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize
126    The vn- stooping firmenesse of my vpright soule.
127    He is our subiect ({Mowbray}) so art thou,
128    Free speech, and fearelesse, I to thee allow.
129    <S {Mow}.> Then {Bullingbrooke}, as low as to thy heart,
130    Through the false passage of thy throat; thou lyest:
131    Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice,
132    Disburst I to his Highnesse souldiers;
133    The other part reseru'd I by consent,
134    For that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt,
135    Vpon remainder of a deere Accompt,
136    Since last I went to France to fetch his Queene:
137    Now swallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death,
138    I slew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace)
139    Neglected my sworne duty in that case:
140    For you my noble Lord of {Lancaster},
141    The honourable Father to my foe,
142    Once I did lay an ambush for your life,
143    A trespasse that doth vex my greeued soule:
144    But ere I last receiu'd the Sacrament,
145    I did confesse it, and exactly begg'd
146    Your Graces pardon, and I hope I had it.
147    This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,
148    It issues from the rancour of a Villaine,
149    A recreant, and most degenerate Traitor,
150    Which in my selfe I boldly will defend,
151    And interchangeably hurle downe my gage
152    Vpon this ouer- weening Traitors foote,
153    To proue my selfe a loyall Gentleman,
154    Euen in the best blood chamber'd in his bosome.
155    In #hast whereof, most heartily I pray
156    Your Highnesse to assigne our Triall day.
157    <S {King}.> Wrath- kindled Gentlemen be rul'd by me:
158    Let's purge this choller without letting blood:
159    This we prescribe, though no Physition,
160    Deepe malice makes too deepe incision.
161    Forget, forgiue, conclude, and be agreed,
162    Our Doctors say, This is no time to bleed.
163    Good Vnckle, let this end where it begun,
164    Wee'l calme the Duke of Norfolke; you, your son.
165    <S {Gaunt}.> To be a make- peace shall become my age,
166   *Throw downe (my  sonne) the Duke of Norfolkes gage.
167    <S {King}.> And Norfolke, throw downe his.
168    <S {Gaunt}.> When {Harrie} when? Obedience bids,
169    Obedience bids I should not bid agen.
170   *<S {King}.> Norfolke, throw downe, we bidde; there is
171    no boote.
172   *<S {Mow}.> My selfe I throw (dread Soueraigne) at thy foot.
173    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame,
174    The one my dutie owes, but my faire name
175    Despight of death, that liues vpon my graue
176    To darke dishonours vse, thou shalt not haue.
177    I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffel'd heere,
178    Pierc'd to the soule with slanders venom'd speare:
179    The which no balme can cure, but his heart blood
180    Which breath'd this poyson.
181    <S {King}.> Rage must be withstood:
182    Giue me his gage: Lyons make Leopards tame.
183   *<S {Mo}.> Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,
184    And I resigne my gage. My deere, deere Lord,
185    The purest treasure mortall times afford
186    Is spotlesse reputation: that away,
187    Men are but gilded loame, or painted clay.
188    A Iewell in a ten times barr'd vp Chest,
189    Is a bold spirit, in a loyall brest.
190    Mine Honor is my life; both grow in one:
191    Take Honor from me, and my life is done.
192    Then (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie,
193    In that I liue; and for that will I die.
194    <S {King}.> Coosin, throw downe your gage,
195    Do you begin.
196   *<S {Bul}.> Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin.
197    Shall I seeme Crest- falne in my fathers sight,
198    Or with pale beggar- feare impeach my hight
199    Before this out- dar'd dastard? Ere my toong,
200    Shall wound mine honor with such feeble wrong;
201    Or sound so base a parle: my teeth shall teare
202    The slauish motiue of recanting feare,
203    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
204    Where shame doth harbour, euen in {Mowbrayes} face.
205    <D {Exit Gaunt}.>
206    <S {King}.> We were not borne to sue, but to command,
207    Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
208    Be readie, (as your liues shall answer it)
209    At Couentree, vpon S[aint]. {Lamberts} day:
210    There shall your swords and Lances arbitrate
211    The swelling difference of your setled hate:
212    Since we cannot attone you, you shall see
213    Iustice designe the Victors Chiualrie.
214    Lord Marshall, command our Officers at Armes,
215    Be readie to direct these home Alarmes. <D {Exeunt}.>
216    <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
217    <D {Enter Gaunt, and Dutchesse of Gloucester}.>
218    <S {Gaunt}.> Alas, the part I had in Glousters blood,
219    Doth more solicite me then your exclaimes,
220    To stirre against the Butchers of his life.
      <P c1>
221    But since correction lyeth in those hands
222    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
223    Put we our quarrell to the #will of heauen,
224    Who when they see the houres ripe on earth,
225    Will raigne hot vengeance on offenders heads.
226    <S {Dut}.> Findes brotherhood in thee no sharper spurre?
227    Hath loue in thy old blood no liuing fire?
228    {Edwards} seuen sonnes (whereof thy selfe art one)
229    Were as seuen violles of his Sacred blood,
230    Or seuen faire branches springing from one roote:
231    Some of those seuen are dride by natures course,
232    Some of those branches by the destinies cut:
233    But {Thomas}, my deere Lord, my life, my Glouster,
234    One Violl full of {Edwards} Sacred blood,
235    One flourishing branch of his most Royall roote
236    Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;
237    Is hackt downe, and his summer leafes all vaded
238    By Enuies hand, and Murders bloody Axe.
239    Ah {Gaunt}! His blood was thine, that bed, that wombe,
240    That mettle, that selfe- mould that fashion'd thee,
241    Made him a man: and though thou liu'st, and breath'st,
242    Yet art thou slaine in him: thou dost consent
243    In some large measure to thy Fathers death,
244    In that thou seest thy wretched brother dye,
245    Who was the modell of thy Fathers life.
246    Call it not patience ({Gaunt}) it is dispaire,
247    In suffring thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
248    Thou shew'st the naked pathway to thy life,
249    Teaching sterne murther how to butcher thee:
250    That which in meane men we intitle patience
251    Is pale cold cowardice in noble brests:
252    What shall I say, to safegard thine owne life,
253    The best way is to venge my Glousters death.
254   *<S {Gaunt}.> Heauens is the quarrell: for heauens substitute
255    His Deputy annointed in his sight,
256    Hath caus'd his death, the which if wrongfully
257    Let heauen reuenge: for I may neuer lift
258    An angry arme against his Minister.
259    <S {Dut}.> Where then (alas  may I) complaint my selfe?
260   *<S {Gau}.> To heauen, the widdowes Champion to defence
261    <S {Dut}.> Why then I will: farewell old {Gaunt}.
262    Thou go'st to Couentrie, there to behold
263    Our Cosine Herford, and fell Mowbray fight:
264    O sit my husbands wrongs on Herfords speare,
265    That it may enter butcher Mowbrayes brest:
266    Or if misfortune misse the first carreere,
267    Be Mowbrayes sinnes so heauy in his bosome,
268    That they may breake his foaming Coursers backe,
269    And throw the Rider headlong in the Lists,
270    A Caytiffe recreant to my Cosine Herford:
271    Farewell old {Gaunt}, thy sometimes brothers wife
272    With her companion Greefe, must end her life.
273    <S {Gau}.> Sister farewell: I must to Couentree,
274    As much good stay with thee, as go with mee.
275   *<S {Dut}.> Yet one word more: Greefe boundeth where it |(falls,
276    Not with the emptie hollownes, but weight:
277    I take my leaue, before I haue begun,
278    For sorrow ends not, when it seemeth done.
279    Commend me to my brother {Edmund Yorke}.
280    Loe, this is all: nay, yet depart not so,
281    Though this be all, do not so quickly go,
282    I shall remember more. Bid him, Oh, what?
283    With all good speed at Plashie visit mee.
284    Alacke, and what shall good old Yorke there see
285    But empty lodgings, and vnfurnish'd walles,
286    Vn- peopel'd Offices, vntroden stones?
287    And what heare there for welcome, but my grones?
288    Therefore commend me, let him not come there,
289    To seeke out sorrow, that dwels euery where:
290    Desolate, desolate will I hence, and dye,
291    The last leaue of thee, takes my weeping eye.  <D {Exeunt}>
292    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
293    <D {Enter Marshall, and Aumerle}.>
294    <S {Mar}.> My L[ord]. {Aumerle}, is {Harry Herford} arm'd.
295    <S {Aum}.> Yea, at all points, and longs to enter in.
296    <S {Mar}.> The Duke of Norfolke, sprightfully and bold,
297    Stayes but the summons of the Appealants Trumpet.
298   *<S {Au}.> Why then the Champions, are prepar'd, and stay
299    For nothing but his Maiesties approach.  <D {Flourish}.>
300    <D {Enter King, Gaunt, Bushy, Bagot, Greene, &}
301    {others: Then Mowbray in Ar-mor,
302    and Harrold}.>
303    <S {Rich}.> Marshall, demand of yonder Champion
304    The cause of his arriuall heere in Armes,
305    Aske him his name, and orderly proceed
306    To sweare him in the iustice of his cause.
307    <S {Mar}.> In Gods name, and the Kings say who y art,
308    And why thou com'st thus knightly clad in Armes?
309    Against what man thou com'st, and what's thy quarrell,
310    Speake truly on thy knighthood, and thine oath,
311    As so defend thee heauen, and thy valour.
312   *<S {Mow}.> My name is {Tho[mas]. Mowbray}, Duke of Norfolk,
313    Who hither comes engaged by my oath
314    (Which heauen defend a knight should violate)
315    Both to defend my loyalty and truth,
316    To God, my King, and his succeeding issue,
317    Against the Duke of Herford, that appeales me:
318    And by the grace of God, and this mine arme,
319    To proue him (in defending of my selfe)
320    A Traitor to my God, my King, and me,
321    And as I truly fight, defend me heauen.
322    <D {Tucket. Enter Hereford, and Harold}.>
323    <S {Rich}.> Marshall: Aske yonder Knight in Armes,
324    Both who he is, and why he commeth hither,
325    Thus placed in habiliments of warre:
326    And formerly according to our Law
327    Depose him in the iustice of his cause.
328   *<S {Mar}.> What is thy name? and wherfore comst y hither
329    Before King {Richard} in his Royall Lists?
330    Against whom com'st thou? and what's thy quarrell?
331    Speake like a true Knight, so defend thee heauen.
332    <S {Bul}.> {Harry} of Herford, Lancaster, and Derbie,
333    Am I: who ready heere do stand in Armes,
334    To proue by heauens grace, and my bodies valour,
335    In Lists, on {Thomas Mowbray} Duke of Norfolke,
336    That he's a Traitor foule, and dangerous,
337    To God of heauen, King {Richard}, and to me,
338    And as I truly fight, defend me heauen.
339    <S {Mar}.> On paine of death, no person be so bold,
340    Or daring hardie as to touch the Listes,
341    Except the Marshall, and such Officers
342    Appointed to direct these faire designes.
343   *<S {Bul}.> Lord Marshall, let me kisse my Soueraigns hand,
344    And bow my knee before his Maiestie:
345    For {Mowbray} and my selfe are like two men,
346    That vow a long and weary pilgrimage,
      <P c1v>
347    Then let vs take a ceremonious leaue
348    And louing farwell of our seuerall friends.
349   *<S {Mar}.> The Appealant in all duty greets your Highnes,
350    And craues to kisse your hand, and take his leaue.
351    <S {Rich}.> We will descend, and fold him in our armes.
352    Cosin of Herford, as thy cause is iust,
353    So be thy fortune in this Royall fight:
354    Farewell, my blood, which if to day thou shead,
355    Lament we may, but not reuenge thee dead.
356    <S {Bull}.> Oh let no noble eye prophane a teare
357    For me, if I be gor'd with {Mowbrayes} speare:
358    As confident, as is the Falcons flight
359    Against a bird, do I with {Mowbray} fight.
360    My louing Lord, I take my leaue of you,
361    Of you (my  Noble Cosin) Lord {Aumerle};
362    Not sicke, although I haue to do with death,
363    But lustie, yong, and cheerely drawing breath.
364    Loe, as at English Feasts, so I regreete
365    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
366    Oh thou the earthy author of my blood,
367    Whose youthfull spirit in me regenerate,
368    Doth with a two- fold rigor lift mee vp
369    To reach at victory aboue my head,
370    Adde proofe vnto mine Armour with thy prayres,
371    And with thy blessings steele my Lances point,
372    That it may enter {Mowbrayes} waxen Coate,
373    And furnish new the name of {Iohn #a Gaunt},
374    Euen in the lusty hauiour of his sonne.
375   *<S {Gaunt}.> Heauen in thy good cause make thee prosp'rous
376    Be swift like lightning in the execution,
377    And let thy blowes doubly redoubled,
378    Fall like amazing thunder on the Caske
379    Of thy amaz'd pernicious enemy.
380    Rouze vp thy youthfull blood, be valiant, and liue.
381    <S {Bul}.> Mine innocence, and S[aint]. {George} to thriue.
382    <S {Mow}.> How euer heauen or fortune cast my lot,
383    There liues, or dies, true to Kings {Richards} Throne,
384    A loyall, iust, and vpright Gentleman:
385    Neuer did Captiue with a freer heart,
386    Cast off his chaines of bondage, and embrace
387    His golden vncontroul'd enfranchisement,
388    More then my dancing soule doth celebrate
389    This Feast of Battell, with mine Aduersarie.
390    Most mighty Liege, and my companion Peeres,
391    Take from my mouth, the wish of happy yeares,
392    As gentle, and as iocond, as to iest,
393    Go I to fight: Truth, hath a quiet brest.
394    <S {Rich}.> Farewell, my Lord, securely I espy
395    Vertue with Valour, couched in thine eye:
396    Order the triall Marshall, and begin.
397    <S {Mar}.> {Harrie} of {Herford}, {Lancaster}, and {Derby},
398    Receiue thy Launce, and heauen defend thy right.
399    <S {Bul}.> Strong as a towre in hope, I cry Amen.
400   *<S {Mar}.> Go beare this Lance to {Thomas} D[uke]. of Norfolke.
401    <S 1.{Har}.> {Harry} of {Herford}, {Lancaster}, and {Derbie},
402    Stands heere for God, his Soueraigne, and himselfe,
403    On paine to be found false, and recreant,
404    To proue the Duke of Norfolke, {Thomas Mowbray},
405    A Traitor to his God, his King, and him,
406    And dares him to set forwards to the fight.
407   *<S 2.{Har}.> Here standeth {Tho[mas]: Mowbray} Duke of Norfolk
408    On paine to be found false and recreant,
409    Both to defend himselfe, and to approue
410    {Henry} of {Herford}, {Lancaster}, and {Derby},
411    To God, his Soueraigne, and to him disloyall:
412    Couragiously, and with a free desire
413    Attending but the signall to begin.  <D {A charge sounded}>
414   *<S {Mar}.> Sound Trumpets, and set forward Combatants:
415    Stay, the King hath throwne his Warder downe.
416   *<S {Rich}.> Let them lay by their Helmets & their Speares,
417    And both returne backe to their Chaires againe:
418    Withdraw with vs, and let the Trumpets sound,
419    While we returne these Dukes what we decree.
420    <D {A long Flourish}.>
421    Draw neere and list
422    What with our Councell we haue done.
423    For that our kingdomes earth should not be soyld
424    With that deere blood which it hath fostered,
425    And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
426    Of ciuill wounds plowgh'd vp with neighbors swords,
427    Which so rouz'd vp with boystrous vntun'd drummes,
428    With harsh resounding Trumpets dreadfull bray,
429    And grating shocke of wrathfull yron Armes,
430    Might from our quiet Confines fright faire peace,
431    And make vs wade euen in our kindreds blood:
432    Therefore, we banish you our Territories.
433    You Cosin Herford, vpon paine of death,
434    Till twice fiue Summers haue enrich'd our fields,
435    Shall not regreet our faire dominions,
436    But treade the stranger pathes of banishment.
437    <S {Bul}.> Your #will be done: This must my comfort be,
438    That Sun that warmes you heere, shall shine on me:
439    And those his golden beames to you heere lent,
440    Shall point on me, and gild my banishment.
441    <S {Rich}.> Norfolke: for thee remaines a heauier dombe,
442    Which I with some vnwillingnesse pronounce,
443    The slye slow houres shall not determinate
444    The datelesse limit of thy deere exile:
445    The hopelesse word, of Neuer to returne,
446    Breath I against thee, vpon paine of life.
447    <S {Mow}.> A heauy sentence, my most Soueraigne Liege,
448    And all vnlook'd for from your Highnesse mouth:
449    A deerer merit, not so deepe a maime,
450    As to be cast forth in the common ayre
451    Haue I deserued at your Highnesse hands.
452    The Language I haue learn'd these forty yeares
453    (My natiue English) now I must forgo,
454    And now my tongues vse is to me no more,
455    Then an vnstringed Vyall, or a Harpe,
456    Or like a cunning Instrument cas'd vp,
457    Or being open, put into his hands
458    That knowes no touch to tune the harmony.
459    Within my mouth you haue engaol'd my tongue,
460    Doubly percullist with my teeth and lippes,
461    And dull, vnfeeling, barren ignorance,
462    Is made my Gaoler to attend on me:
463    I am too old to fawne vpon a Nurse,
464    Too farre in yeeres to be a pupill now:
465    What is thy sentence then, but speechlesse death,
466    Which robs my tongue from breathing natiue breath?
467    <S {Rich}.> It boots thee not to be compassionate,
468    After our sentence, plaining comes too late.
469   *<S {Mow}.> Then thus I turne me from my countries light
470    To dwell in solemne shades of endlesse night.
471    <S {Ric}.> Returne againe, and take an oath with thee,
472    Lay on our Royall sword, your banisht hands;
473    Sweare by the duty that you owe to heauen
474    (Our part therein we banish with your selues)
475    To keepe the Oath that we administer:
476    You neuer shall (so helpe you Truth, and Heauen)
477    Embrace each others loue in banishment,
478    Nor euer looke vpon each others face,
      <P c2>
479    Nor euer write, regreete, or reconcile
480    This lowring tempest of your home- bred hate,
481    Nor euer by aduised purpose meete,
482    To plot, contriue, or complot any #ill,
483    'Gainst Vs, our State, our Subiects, or our Land.
484    <S {Bull}.> I sweare.
485    <S {Mow}.> And I, to keepe all this.
486    <S {Bul}.> Norfolke, so fare, as to mine enemie,
487    By this time (had the King permitted vs)
488    One of our soules had wandred in the ayre,
489    Banish'd this fraile sepulchre of our flesh,
490    As now our flesh is banish'd from this Land.
491    Confesse thy Treasons, ere thou flye this Realme,
492    Since thou hast farre to go, beare not along
493    The clogging burthen of a guilty soule.
494    <S {Mow}.> No {Bullingbroke}: If euer I were Traitor,
495    My name be blotted from the booke of Life,
496    And I from heauen banish'd, as from hence:
497    But what thou art, heauen, thou, and I do know,
498    And all too soone (I feare) the King shall rue.
499    Farewell (my Liege) now no way can I stray,
500    Saue backe to England, all the worlds my way.  <D {Exit}.>
501    <S {Rich}.> Vncle, euen in the glasses of thine eyes
502    I see thy greeued heart: thy sad aspect,
503    Hath from the number of his banish'd yeares
504    Pluck'd foure away: Six frozen Winters spent,
505    Returne with welcome home, from banishment.
506    <S {Bul}.> How long a time lyes in one little word:
507    Foure lagging Winters, and foure wanton springs
508    End in a word, such is the breath of Kings.
509    <S {Gaunt}.> I thanke my Liege, that in regard of me
510    He shortens foure yeares of my sonnes exile:
511    But little vantage shall I reape thereby.
512    For ere the sixe yeares that he hath to spend
513   *Can change their Moones, and bring their times about,
514    My oyle- dride Lampe, and time- bewasted light
515    Shall be extinct with age, and endlesse night:
516    My inch of Taper, will be burnt, and done,
517    And blindfold death, not let me see my sonne.
518    <S {Rich}.> Why Vncle, thou hast many yeeres to liue.
519   *<S {Gaunt}.> But not a minute (King) that thou canst giue;
520    Shorten my dayes thou canst with sudden sorow,
521    And plucke nights from me, but not lend a morrow:
522    Thou canst helpe time to furrow me with age,
523    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage:
524    Thy word is currant with him, for my death,
525    But dead, thy kingdome cannot buy my breath.
526    <S {Ric}.> Thy sonne is banish'd vpon good aduice,
527    Whereto thy tongue a party- verdict gaue,
528    Why at our Iustice seem'st thou then to lowre?
529   *<S {Gau}.> Things sweet to tast, proue in digestion sowre:
530    You vrg'd me as a Iudge, but I had rather
531    You would haue bid me argue like a Father.
532    Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
533    I was too strict to make mine owne away:
534    But you gaue leaue to my vnwilling tong,
535    Against my #will, to do my selfe this wrong.
536    <S {Rich}.> Cosine farewell: and Vncle bid him so:
537    Six yeares we banish him, and he shall go.  <D {Exit}.>
538    <D {Flourish}.>
539    <S {Au}.> Cosine farewell: what presence must not know
540    From where you do remaine, let paper show.
541    <S {Mar}.> My Lord, no leaue take I, for I will ride
542    As farre as land will let me, by your side.
543   *<S {Gaunt}.> Oh to what purpose dost thou hord thy words,
544    That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends?
545    <S {Bull}.> I haue too few to take my leaue of you,
546    When the tongues office should be prodigall,
547    To breath th' abundant dolour of the heart.
548    <S {Gau}.> Thy greefe is but thy absence for a time.
549    <S {Bull}.> Ioy absent, greefe is present for that time.
550   *<S {Gau}.> What is sixe Winters, they are quickely gone?
551    <S {Bul}.> To men in ioy, but greefe makes one houre ten.
552    <S {Gau}.> Call it a trauell that thou tak'st for pleasure.
553    <S {Bul}.> My heart will sigh, when I miscall it so,
554    Which findes it an inforced Pilgrimage.
555    <S {Gau}.> The sullen passage of thy weary steppes
556    Esteeme a soyle, wherein thou art to set
557    The precious Iewell of thy home returne.
558    <S {Bul}.> Oh who can hold a fire in his hand
559    By thinking on the frostie {Caucasus}?
560    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite,
561    By bare imagination of a Feast?
562    Or Wallow naked in December snow
563    By thinking on fantasticke summers heate?
564    Oh no, the apprehension of the good
565    Giues but the greater feeling to the worse:
566    Fell sorrowes tooth, doth euer ranckle more
567    Then when it bites, but lanceth not the sore.
568   *<S {Gau}.> Come, come (my son) Ile bring thee on thy way
569    Had I thy youth, and cause, I would not stay.
570   *<S {Bul}.> Then Englands ground farewell: sweet soil adieu,
571    My Mother, and my Nurse, which beares me yet:
572    Where ere I wander, boast of this I can,
573    Though banish'd, yet a true- borne Englishman.
574    <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
575    <D {Enter King, Aumerle, Greene, and Bagot}.>
576    <S {Rich}.> We did obserue. Cosine {Aumerle},
577    How far brought you high Herford on his way?
578    <S {Aum}.> I brought high Herford (if you call him so)
579    But to the next high way, and there I left him.
580   *<S {Rich}.> And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
581   *<S {Aum}.> Faith none for me: except the Northeast wind
582    Which then grew bitterly against our face,
583    Awak'd the sleepie rhewme, and so by chance
584    Did grace our hollow parting with a teare.
585   *<S {Rich}.> What said our Cosin when you parted with him?
586   *<S {Au}.> Farewell: and for my hart disdained y my tongue
587    Should so prophane the word, that taught me craft
588    To counterfeit oppression of such greefe,
589    That word seem'd buried in my sorrowes graue.
590   *Marry, would the word Farwell, haue lengthen'd houres,
591    And added yeeres to his short banishment,
592    He should haue had a volume of Farwels,
593    But since it would not, he had none of me.
594    <S {Rich}.> He is our Cosin (Cosin) but 'tis doubt,
595    When time shall call him home from banishment,
596    Whether our kinsman come to see his friends,
597    Our selfe, and {Bushy}: heere {Bagot} and {Greene}
598    Obseru'd his Courtship to the common people:
599    How he did seeme to diue into their hearts,
600    With humble, and familiar courtesie,
601    What reuerence he did throw away on slaues;
602    Wooing poore Craftes- men, with the craft of soules,
603    And patient vnder- bearing of his Fortune,
604    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
605    Off goes his bonnet to an Oyster- wench,
      <P c2v>
606    A brace of Dray- men bid God speed him well,
607    And had the tribute of his supple knee,
608    With thankes my Countrimen, my louing friends,
609    As were our England in reuersion his,
610    And he our subiects next degree in hope.
611    <S {Gr}.> Well, he is gone, & with him go these thoughts:
612    Now for the Rebels, which stand out in Ireland,
613    Expedient manage must be made my Liege
614    Ere further leysure, yeeld them further meanes
615    For their aduantage, and your Highnesse losse.
616    <S {Ric}.> We will our selfe in person to this warre,
617    And for our Coffers, with too great a Court,
618    And liberall Largesse, are growne somewhat light,
619    We are inforc'd to farme our royall Realme,
620    The Reuennew whereof shall furnish vs
621    For our affayres in hand: if that come short
622    Our Substitutes at home shall haue Blanke- charters:
623    Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
624    They shall subscribe them for large summes of Gold,
625    And send them after to supply our wants:
626    For we will make for Ireland presently.
627    <D {Enter Bushy}.>
628    {Bushy}, what newes?
629    <S {Bu}.> Old {Iohn of Gaunt} is verie sicke my Lord,
630    Sodainly taken, and hath sent post haste
631    To entreat your Maiesty to visit him.
632    <S {Ric}.> Where lyes he?
633    <S {Bu}.> At Ely house.
634    <S {Ric}.> Now put it (heauen) in his Physitians minde,
635    To helpe him to his graue immediately:
636    The lining of his coffers shall make Coates
637    To decke our souldiers for these Irish warres.
638    Come Gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
639   *Pray heauen we may make #hast, and come too late.  <D {Exit}.>
640    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
641    <D {Enter Gaunt, sicke with Yorke}.>
642    <S {Gau}.> Will the King come, that I may breath my last
643    In wholsome counsell to his vnstaid youth?
644   *<S {Yor}.> Vex not your selfe, nor striue not with your breth,
645    For all in vaine comes counsell to his eare.
646    <S {Gau}.> Oh but (they say) the tongues of dying men
647    Inforce attention like deepe harmony;
648   *Where words are scarse, they are seldome spent in vaine,
649    For they breath truth, that breath their words in paine.
650    He that no more must say, is listen'd more,
651    Then they whom youth and ease haue taught to glose,
652    More are mens ends markt, then their liues before,
653    The setting Sun, and Musicke in the close
654    As the last taste of sweetes, is sweetest last,
655    Writ in remembrance, more then things long past;
656    Though {Richard} my liues counsell would not heare,
657    My deaths sad tale, may yet vndeafe his eare.
658    <S {Yor}.> No, it is stopt with other flatt'ring sounds
659    As praises of his state: then there are found
660    Lasciuious Meeters, to whose venom sound
661    The open eare of youth doth alwayes listen.
662    Report of fashions in proud Italy,
663    Whose manners still our tardie apish Nation
664    Limpes after in base imitation.
665    Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity,
666    So it be new, there's no respect how vile,
667    That is not quickly buz'd into his eares?
668    That all too late comes counsell to be heard,
669    Where will doth mutiny with wits regard:
670    Direct not him, whose way himselfe will choose,
671    Tis breath thou lackst, and that breath wilt thou loose.
672    <S {Gaunt}.> Me thinkes I am a Prophet new inspir'd,
673    And thus expiring, do foretell of him,
674    His rash fierce blaze of Ryot cannot last,
675    For violent fires soone burne out themselues,
676    Small showres last long, but sodaine stormes are short,
677    He tyres betimes, that spurs too fast betimes;
678    With eager feeding, food doth choake the feeder:
679    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
680    Consuming meanes soone preyes vpon it selfe.
681    This royall Throne of Kings, this sceptred Isle,
682    This earth of Maiesty, this seate of Mars,
683    This other Eden, demy paradise,
684    This Fortresse built by Nature for her selfe,
685    Against infection, and the hand of warre:
686    This happy breed of men, this little world,
687    This precious stone, set in the siluer sea,
688    Which serues it in the office of a wall,
689    Or as a Moate defensiue to a house,
690    Against the enuy of lesse happier Lands,
691    This blessed plot, this earth, this Realme, this England,
692    This Nurse, this teeming wombe of Royall Kings,
693    Fear'd by their breed, and famous for their birth,
694    Renowned for their deeds, as farre from home,
695    For Christian seruice, and true Chiualrie,
696    As is the sepulcher in stubborne {Iury}
697    Of the Worlds ransome, blessed {Maries} Sonne.
698    This Land of such deere soules, this deere- deere Land,
699    Deere for her reputation through the world,
700    Is now Leas'd out (I dye pronouncing it)
701    Like to a Tenement or pelting Farme.
702    England bound in with the triumphant sea,
703    Whose rocky shore beates backe the enuious siedge
704    Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
705    With Inky blottes, and rotten Parchment bonds.
706    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
707    Hath made a shamefull conquest of it selfe.
708    Ah! would the scandall vanish with my life,
709    How happy then were my ensuing death?
710    <D {Enter King, Queene, Aumerle, Bushy, Greene},
711    {Bagot, Ros, and Willoughby}.>
712    <S {Yor}.> The King is come, deale mildly with his youth,
713    For young hot Colts, being rag'd, do rage the more.
714    <S {Qu}.> How fares our noble Vncle Lancaster?
715    <S {Ri}.> What comfort man? How ist with aged {Gaunt}?
716    <S {Ga}.> Oh how that name befits my composition:
717    Old {Gaunt} indeed, and gaunt in being old:
718    Within me greefe hath kept a tedious fast,
719    And who abstaynes from meate, that is not gaunt?
720    For sleeping England long time haue I watcht,
721    Watching breeds leannesse, leannesse is all gaunt.
722    The pleasure that some Fathers feede vpon,
723    Is my strict fast, I meane my Childrens lookes,
724    And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
725    Gaunt am I for the graue, gaunt as a graue,
726    Whose hollow wombe inherits naught but bones.
727    <S {Ric}.> Can sicke men play so nicely with their names?
728    <S {Gau}.> No, misery makes sport to mocke it selfe:
729    Since thou dost seeke to kill my name in mee,
      <P c3>
730    I mocke my name (great King) to flatter thee.
731    <S {Ric}.> Should dying men flatter those that liue?
732    <S {Gau}.> No, no, men liuing flatter those that dye.
733    <S {Rich}.> Thou now #a dying, sayst thou flatter'st me.
734    <S {Gau}.> Oh no, thou dyest, though I the sicker be.
735    <S {Rich}.> I am in health, I breath, I see thee #ill.
736    <S {Gau}.> Now he that made me, knowes I see thee #ill:
737    #Ill in my selfe to see, and  in thee, seeing #ill,
738    Thy death- bed is no lesser then the Land,
739    Wherein thou lyest in reputation sicke,
740    And thou too care- lesse patient as thou art,
741    Commit'st thy 'anointed body to the cure
742    Of those Physitians, that first wounded thee.
743    A thousand flatterers sit within thy Crowne,
744    Whose compasse is no bigger then thy head,
745    And yet incaged in so small a Verge,
746    The waste is no whit lesser then thy Land:
747    Oh had thy Grandsire with a Prophets eye,
748    Seene how his sonnes sonne, should destroy his sonnes,
749    From forth thy reach he would haue laid thy shame,
750    Deposing thee before thou wert possest,
751    Which art possest now to depose thy selfe.
752    Why (Cosine) were thou Regent of the world,
753    It were a shame to let his Land by lease:
754    But for thy world enioying but this Land,
755    Is it not more then shame, to shame it so?
756    Landlord of England art thou, and not King:
757    Thy state of Law, is bondslaue to the law,
758    And===
759    <S {Rich}.> And thou, a lunaticke leane- witted foole,
760    Presuming on an Agues priuiledge,
761    Dar'st with thy frozen admonition
762    Make pale our cheeke, chasing the Royall blood
763    With fury, from his natiue residence?
764    Now by my Seates right Royall Maiestie,
765    Wer't thou not Brother to great {Edwards} sonne,
766    This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head,
767    Should run thy head from thy vnreuerent shoulders.
768    <S {Gau}.> Oh spare me not, my brothers {Edwards} sonne,
769    For that I was his Father {Edwards} sonne:
770    That blood already (like the Pellican)
771    Thou hast tapt out, and drunkenly carows'd.
772    My brother Gloucester, plaine well meaning soule
773    (Whom faire befall in heauen 'mongst happy soules)
774    May be a president, and witnesse good,
775    That thou respect'st not spilling {Edwards} blood:
776    Ioyne with the present sicknesse that I haue,
777    And thy vnkindnesse be like crooked age,
778    To crop at once a too- long wither'd flowre.
779    Liue in thy shame, but dye not shame with thee,
780    These words heereafter, thy tormentors bee.
781    Conuey me to my bed, then to my graue,
782    Loue they to liue, that loue and honor haue.  <D {Exit}>
783    <S {Rich}.> And let them dye, that age and sullens haue,
784    For both hast thou, and both become the graue.
785    <S {Yor}.> I do beseech your Maiestie impute his words
786    To wayward sicklinesse, and age in him:
787    He loues you on my life, and holds you deere
788    As {Harry} Duke of {Herford}, were he heere.
789    <S {Rich}.> Right, you say true: as {Herfords} loue, so his;
790    As theirs, so mine: and all be as it is.
791    <D {Enter Northumberland}.>
792   *<S {Nor}.> My Liege, olde {Gaunt} commends him to your
793    Maiestie.
794    <S {Rich}.> What sayes he?
795    <S {Nor}.> Nay nothing, all is said:
796    His tongue is now a stringlesse instrument,
797    Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
798    <S {Yor}.> Be Yorke the next, that must be bankrupt so,
799    Though death be poore, it ends a mortall wo.
800    <S {Rich}.> The ripest fruit first fals, and so doth he,
801    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be:
802    So much for that. Now for our Irish warres,
803    We must supplant those rough rug- headed Kernes,
804    Which liue like venom, where no venom else
805    But onely they, haue priuiledge to liue.
806    And for these great affayres do aske some charge
807    Towards our assistance, we do seize to vs
808    The plate, coine, reuennewes, and moueables,
809    Whereof our Vncle {Gaunt} did stand possest.
810    <S {Yor}.> How long shall I be patient? Oh how long
811    Shall tender dutie make me suffer wrong?
812    Not {Glousters} death, nor {Herfords} banishment,
813    Nor {Gauntes} rebukes, nor Englands priuate wrongs,
814    Nor the preuention of poore {Bullingbrooke},
815    About his marriage, nor my owne disgrace
816    Haue euer made me sowre my patient cheeke,
817    Or bend one wrinckle on my Soueraignes face:
818    I am the last of noble {Edwards} sonnes,
819    Of whom thy Father Prince of Wales was first,
820    In warre was neuer Lyon rag'd more fierce:
821    In peace, was neuer gentle Lambe more milde,
822    Then was that yong and Princely Gentleman,
823    His face thou hast, for euen so look'd he
824    Accomplish'd with the number of thy howers:
825    But when he frown'd, it was against the French,
826    And not against his friends: his noble hand
827    Did win what he did spend: and spent not that
828    Which his triumphant fathers hand had won:
829    His hands were guilty of no kindreds blood,
830    But bloody with the enemies of his kinne:
831    Oh {Richard}, {Yorke} is too farre gone with greefe,
832    Or else he neuer would compare betweene.
833    <S {Rich}.> Why Vncle,
834    What's the matter?
835    <S {Yor}.> Oh my Liege, pardon me if you please, if not
836    I pleas'd not to be pardon'd, am content with all:
837    Seeke you to seize, and gripe into your hands
838    The Royalties and Rights of banish'd Herford?
839    Is not {Gaunt} dead? and doth not Herford liue?
840    Was not {Gaunt} iust? and is not {Harry} true?
841    Did not the one deserue to haue an heyre?
842    Is not his heyre a well- deseruing sonne?
843    Take Herfords rights away, and take from time
844    His Charters, and his customarie rights:
845    Let not to morrow then insue to day,
846    Be not thy selfe. For how art thou a King
847    But by faire sequence and succession?
848    Now afore God, God forbid I say true,
849    If you do wrongfully seize Herfords right,
850    Call in his Letters Patents that he hath
851    By his Atturneyes generall, to sue
852    His Liuerie, and denie his offer'd homage,
853    You plucke a thousand dangers on your head,
854    You loose a thousand well- disposed hearts,
855    And pricke my tender patience to those thoughts
856    Which honor and allegeance cannot thinke.
857    <S {Ric}.> Thinke what you will: we seise into our hands,
858    His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.
859    <S {Yor}.> Ile not be by the while: My Liege farewell,
      <P c3v>
860    What will ensue heereof, there's none can tell.
861    But by bad courses may be vnderstood,
862    That their euents can neuer fall out good.  <D {Exit}.>
863    <S {Rich}.> Go {Bushie} to the Earle of {Wiltshire} streight,
864    Bid him repaire to vs to {Ely} house,
865    To see this businesse: to morrow next
866    We will for {Ireland}, and 'tis time, I trow:
867    And we create in absence of our selfe
868    Our Vncle Yorke, Lord Gouernor of England:
869    For he is iust, and alwayes lou'd vs well.
870    Come on our Queene, to morrow must we part,
871    Be merry, for our time of stay is short.  <D {Flourish}.>
872    <D {Manet North. Willoughby, & Ross}.>
873    <S {Nor}.> Well Lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
874    <S {Ross}.> And liuing too, for now his sonne is Duke.
875    <S {Wil}.> Barely in title, not in reuennew.
876    <S {Nor}.> Richly in both, if iustice had her right.
877   *<S {Ross}.> My heart is great: but it must break with silence,
878    Er't be disburthen'd with a liberall tongue.
879   *<S {Nor}.> Nay speake thy mind: & let him ne'r speak more
880    That speakes thy words againe to do thee harme.
881   *<S {Wil}.> Tends that thou'dst speake to th' Du[ke]. of Hereford,
882    If it be so, out with it boldly man,
883    Quicke is mine eare to heare of good towards him.
884    <S {Ross}.> No good at all that I can do for him,
885    Vnlesse you call it good to pitie him,
886    Bereft and gelded of his patrimonie.
887   *<S {Nor}.> Now afore heauen, 'tis shame such wrongs are
888    borne.
889    In him a royall Prince, and many moe
890    Of noble blood in this declining Land;
891    The King is not himselfe, but basely led
892    By Flatterers, and what they will informe
893    Meerely in hate 'gainst any of vs all,
894    That will the King seuerely prosecute
895    'Gainst vs, our liues, our children, and our heires.
896   *<S {Ros}.> The Commons hath he pil'd with greeuous taxes
897    And quite lost their hearts: the Nobles hath he finde
898    For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
899    <S {Wil}.> And daily new exactions are deuis'd,
900    As blankes, beneuolences, and I wot not what:
901    But what #o' Gods name doth become of this?
902   *<S {Nor}.> Wars hath not wasted it, for war'd he hath not.
903    But basely yeelded vpon comprimize,
904    That which his Ancestors atchieu'd with blowes:
905    More hath he spent in peace, then they in warres.
906   *<S {Ros}.> The Earle of Wiltshire  hath the realme in Farme.
907   *<S {Wil}.> The Kings growne bankrupt like a broken man.
908    <S {Nor}.> Reproach, and dissolution hangeth ouer him.
909    <S {Ros}.> He hath not monie for these Irish warres:
910    (His burthenous taxations notwithstanding)
911    But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke.
912    <S {Nor}.> His noble Kinsman, most degenerate King:
913    But Lords, we heare this fearefull tempest sing,
914    Yet seeke no shelter to auoid the storme:
915    We see the winde sit sore vpon our sailes,
916    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
917    <S {Ros}.> We see the very wracke that we must suffer,
918    And vnauoyded is the danger now
919    For suffering so the causes of our wracke.
920   *<S {Nor}.> Not so: euen through the hollow eyes of death,
921    I spie life peering: but I dare not say
922    How neere the tidings of our comfort is.
923   *<S {Wil}.> Nay let vs share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours
924    <S {Ros}.> Be confident to speake Northumberland,
925    We three, are but thy selfe, and speaking so,
926    Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold.
927    <S {Nor}.> Then thus: I haue from Port {le Blan}
928    A Bay in {Britaine}, receiu'd intelligence,
929    That {Harry} Duke of {Herford}, {Rainald} Lord {Cobham},
930    That late broke from the Duke of {Exeter},
931    His brother Archbishop, late of {Canterbury},
932    Sir {Thomas Erpingham}, Sir {Iohn Rainston},
933    Sir {Iohn Norberie}, & Sir {Robert Waterton}, & {Francis Quoint},
934    All these well furnish'd by the Duke of {Britaine},
935    With eight tall ships, three thousand men of warre
936    Are making hither with all due expedience,
937    And shortly meane to touch our Northerne shore:
938    Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
939    The first departing of the King for Ireland.
940    If then we shall shake off our slauish yoake,
941    Impe out our drooping Countries broken wing,
942    Redeeme from broaking pawne the blemish'd Crowne,
943    Wipe off the dust that hides our Scepters gilt,
944    And make high Maiestie looke like it selfe,
945    Away with me in poste to {Rauenspurgh},
946    But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
947    Stay, and be secret, and my selfe will go.
948   *<S {Ros}.> To horse, to horse, vrge doubts to them y feare.
949    <S {Wil}.> Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
950    <D {Exeunt}.>
951    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
952    <D {Enter Queene, Bushy, and Bagot}.>
953    <S {Bush}.> Madam, your Maiesty is too much sad,
954    You promis'd when you parted with the King,
955    To lay aside selfe- harming heauinesse,
956    And entertaine a cheerefull disposition.
957    <S {Qu}.> To please the King, I did: to please my selfe
958    I cannot do it: yet I know no cause
959    Why I should welcome such a guest as greefe,
960    Saue bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
961    As my sweet {Richard}; yet againe me thinkes,
962    Some vnborne sorrow, ripe in fortunes wombe
963    Is comming towards me, and my inward soule
964    With nothing trembles, at something it greeues,
965    More then with parting from my Lord the King.
966   *<S {Bush}.> Each substance of a greefe hath twenty shadows
967    Which shewes like greefe it selfe, but is not so:
968    For sorrowes eye, glazed with blinding teares,
969    Diuides one thing intire, to many obiects,
970    Like perspectiues, which rightly gaz'd vpon
971    Shew nothing but confusion, ey'd awry,
972    Distinguish forme: so your sweet Maiestie
973    Looking awry vpon your Lords departure,
974    Finde shapes of greefe, more then himselfe to waile,
975    Which look'd on as it is, is naught but shadowes
976    Of what it is not: then thrice- gracious Queene,
977    More then your Lords departure weep not, more's not |(seene;
978    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrowes eie,
979    Which for things true, weepe things imaginary.
980    <S {Qu}.> It may be so: but yet my inward soule
981    Perswades me it is otherwise: how ere it be,
982    I cannot but be sad: so heauy sad,
983    As though on thinking on no thought I thinke,
984    Makes me with heauy nothing faint and shrinke.
985    <S {Bush}.> 'Tis nothing but conceit (my gracious Lady.)
      <P c4>
986    <S {Qu}.> 'Tis nothing lesse: conceit is still deriu'd
987    From some fore- father greefe, mine is not so,
988    For nothing hath begot my something greefe,
989    Or something, hath the nothing that I greeue,
990    'Tis in reuersion that I do possesse,
991    But what it is, that is not yet knowne, what
992    I cannot name, 'tis namelesse woe I wot.
993    <D {Enter Greene}.>
994   *<S {Gree}.> Heauen saue your Maiesty, and wel met Gentle-|(men:
995    I hope the King is not yet shipt for Ireland.
996    <S {Qu}.> Why hop'st thou so? Tis better hope he is:
997    For his designes craue #hast, his #hast good hope,
998    Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipt?
999   *<S {Gre}.> That he our hope, might haue retyr'd his power,
1000   and driuen into dispaire an enemies hope,
1001   Who strongly hath set footing in this Land.
1002   The banish'd {Bullingbrooke} repeales himselfe,
1003   And with vp- lifted Armes is safe arriu'd
1004   At {Rauenspurg}.
1005   <S {Qu}.> Now God in heauen forbid.
1006   <S {Gr}.> O Madam 'tis too true: and that is worse,
1007   The L[ord]. Northumberland, his yong sonne {Henrie Percie},
1008   The Lords of {Rosse}, {Beaumond}, and {Willoughby},
1009   With all their powrefull friends are fled to him.
1010  *<S {Bush}.> Why haue you not proclaim'd Northumberland
1011   And the rest of the reuolted faction, Traitors?
1012   <S {Gre}.> We haue: whereupon the Earle of Worcester
1013   Hath broke his staffe, resign'd his Stewardship,
1014  *And al the houshold seruants fled with him to {Bullinbrook}
1015   <S {Qu}.> So {Greene}, thou art the midwife of my woe,
1016   And {Bullinbrooke} my sorrowes dismall heyre:
1017   Now hath my soule brought forth her prodegie,
1018   And I a gasping new deliuered mother,
1019   Haue woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow ioyn'd.
1020   <S {Bush}.> Dispaire not Madam.
1021   <S {Qu}.> Who shall hinder me?
1022   I will dispaire, and be at enmitie
1023   With couzening hope; he is a Flatterer,
1024   A Parasite, a keeper backe of death,
1025   Who gently would dissolue the bands of life,
1026   Which false hopes linger in extremity.
1027   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
1028   <S {Gre}.> Heere comes the Duke of Yorke.
1029   <S {Qu}.> With signes of warre about his aged necke,
1030   Oh full of carefull businesse are his lookes:
1031   Vncle, for heauens sake speake comfortable words:
1032   <S {Yor}.> Comfort's in heauen, and we are on the earth,
1033   Where nothing liues but crosses, care and greefe:
1034   Your husband he is gone to saue farre off,
1035   Whilst others come to make him loose at home:
1036   Heere am I left to vnder- prop his Land,
1037   Who weake with age, cannot support my selfe:
1038   Now comes the sicke houre that his surfet made,
1039   Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.
1040   <D {Enter a seruant}.>
1041   <S {Ser}.> My Lord, your sonne was gone before I came.
1042   <S {Yor}.> He was: why so: go all which way it will:
1043   The Nobles they are fled, the Commons they are cold,
1044   And will I feare reuolt on Herfords side.
1045   Sirra, get thee to Plashie to my sister Gloster,
1046   Bid her send me presently a thousand pound,
1047   Hold, take my Ring.
1048   <S {Ser}.> My Lord, I had forgot
1049  *To tell your Lordship, to day I came by, and call'd there,
1050   But I shall greeue you to report the rest.
1051   <S {Yor}.> What is't knaue?
1052   <S {Ser}.> An houre before I came, the Dutchesse di'de.
1053   <S {Yor}.> Heau'n for his mercy, what a tide of woes
1054   Come rushing on this wofull Land at once?
1055   I know not what to do: I would to heauen
1056   (So my vntruth had not prouok'd him to it)
1057   The King had cut off my head with my brothers.
1058   What, are there postes dispatcht for Ireland?
1059   How shall we do for money for these warres?
1060   Come sister (Cozen I would say) pray pardon me.
1061   Go fellow, get thee home, prouide some Carts,
1062   And bring away the Armour that is there.
1063   Gentlemen, will you muster men?
1064   If I know how, or which way to order these affaires
1065   Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,
1066   Neuer beleeue me. Both are my kinsmen,
1067   Th' one is my Soueraigne, whom both my oath
1068   And dutie bids defend: th' other againe
1069   Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd,
1070   Whom conscience, and my kindred bids to right:
1071   Well, somewhat we must do: Come Cozen,
1072   Ile dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster vp your men,
1073   And meet me presently at Barkley Castle:
1074   I should to Plashy too: but time will not permit,
1075  *All is vneuen, and euery thing is left at six and seuen.  <D {Exit}>
1076  *<S {Bush}.> The winde sits faire for newes to go to Ireland,
1077   But none returnes: For vs to leuy power
1078   Proportionable to th' enemy, is all impossible.
1079   <S {Gr}.> Besides our neerenesse to the King in loue,
1080   Is neere the hate of those loue not the King.
1081  *<S {Ba}.> And that's the wauering Commons, for their loue
1082   Lies in their purses, and who so empties them,
1083   By so much fils their hearts with deadly hate.
1084  *<S {Bush}.> Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd
1085   <S {Bag}.> If iudgement lye in them, then so do we,
1086   Because we haue beene euer neere the King.
1087  *<S {Gr}.> Well: I will for refuge straight to Bristoll Castle,
1088   The Earle of Wiltshire is alreadie there.
1089   <S {Bush}.> Thither will I with you, for little office
1090   Will the hatefull Commons performe for vs,
1091   Except like Curres, to teare vs all in peeces:
1092   Will you go along with vs?
1093   <S {Bag}.> No, I will to Ireland to his Maiestie:
1094   Farewell, if hearts presages be not vaine,
1095   We three here part, that neu'r shall meete againe.
1096  *<S {Bu}.> That's as Yorke thriues to beate back {Bullinbroke}
1097   <S {Gr}.> Alas poore Duke, the taske he vndertakes
1098   Is numbring sands, and drinking Oceans drie,
1099   Where one on his side fights, thousands will flye.
1100   <S {Bush}.> Farewell at once, for once, for all, and euer.
1101   Well, we may meete againe.
1102   <S {Bag}.> I feare me neuer.  <D {Exit}.>
1103   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1104   <D {Enter the Duke of Hereford, and Northum-berland}.>
1105  _
1106   <S {Bul}.> How farre is it my Lord to Berkley now?
1107   <S {Nor}.> Beleeue me noble Lord,
1108   I am a stranger heere in Gloustershire,
1109   These high wilde hilles, and rough vneeuen waies,
1110   Drawes out our miles, and makes them wearisome.
1111   And yet our faire discourse hath beene as sugar,
      <P c4v><C A>
1112   Making the hard way sweet and delectable:
1113   But I bethinke me, what a wearie way
1114   From Rauenspurgh to Cottshold will be found,
1115   In {Rosse} and {Willoughby}, wanting your companie,
1116   Which I protest hath very much beguild
1117   The tediousnesse, and processe of my trauell:
1118   But theirs is sweetned with the hope to haue
1119   The present benefit that I possesse;
1120   And hope to ioy, is little lesse in ioy,
1121   Then hope enioy'd: By this, the wearie Lords
1122   Shall make their way seeme short, as mine hath done,
1123   By sight of what I haue, your Noble Companie.
1124   <S {Bull}.> Of much lesse value is my Companie,
1125   Then your good words: but who comes here?
1126   <D {Enter H[arry]. Percie}.>
1127   <S {North}.> It is my Sonne, young {Harry Percie},
1128   Sent from my Brother {Worcester}: Whence soeuer.
1129   {Harry}, how fares your Vnckle?
1130  *<S {Percie}.> I had thought, my Lord, to haue learn'd his
1131   health of you.
1132   <S {North}.> Why, is he not with the Queene?
1133  *<S {Percie}.> No, my good Lord, he hath forsook the Court,
1134   Broken his Staffe of Office, and disperst
1135   The Household of the King.
1136   <S {North}.> What was his reason?
1137   He was not so resolu'd, when we last spake together.
1138  *<S {Percie}.> Because your Lordship was proclaimed Traitor.
1139   But hee, my Lord, is gone to Rauenspurgh,
1140   To offer seruice to the Duke of Hereford,
1141   And sent me ouer by Barkely, to discouer
1142   What power the Duke of Yorke had leuied there,
1143   Then with direction to repaire to Rauenspurgh.
1144  *<S {North}.> Haue you forgot the Duke of Hereford (Boy.)
1145   <S {Percie}.> No, my good Lord; for that is not forgot
1146   Which ne're I did remember: to my knowledge,
1147   I neuer in my life did looke on him.
1148  *<S {North}.> Then learne to know him now: this is the
1149   Duke.
1150   <S {Percie}.> My gracious Lord, I tender you my seruice,
1151   Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,
1152   Which elder dayes shall ripen, and confirme
1153   To more approued seruice, and desert.
1154   <S {Bull}.> I thanke thee gentle {Percie}, and be sure
1155   I count my selfe in nothing else so happy,
1156   As in a Soule remembring my good Friends:
1157   And as my Fortune ripens with thy Loue,
1158   It shall be still thy true Loues recompence,
1159   My Heart this Couenant makes, my Hand thus seales it.
1160   <S {North}.> How farre is it to Barkely? and what stirre
1161   Keepes good old {Yorke} there, with his Men of Warre?
1162  *<S {Percie}.> There stands the Castle, by yond tuft of Trees,
1163   Mann'd with three hundred men, as I haue heard,
1164   And in it are the Lords of {Yorke}, {Barkely}, and {Seymor},
1165   None else of Name, and noble estimate.
1166   <D {Enter Rosse and Willoughby}.>
1167   <S {North}.> Here come the Lords of {Rosse} and {Willoughby},
1168   Bloody with spurring, fierie red with haste.
1169   <S {Bull}.> Welcome my Lords, I wot your loue pursues
1170   A banisht Traytor; all my Treasurie
1171   Is yet but vnfelt thankes, which more enrich'd,
1172   Shall be your loue, and labours recompence.
1173  *<S {Ross}.> Your presence makes vs rich, most Noble Lord.
1174   <S {Willo}.> And farre surmounts our labour to attaine it.
1175  *<S {Bull}.> Euermore thankes, th' Exchequer of the poore,
1176   Which till my infant- fortune comes to yeeres,
1177   Stands for my Bountie: but who comes here?
1178   <D {Enter Barkely}.>
1179   <S {North}.> It is my Lord of Barkely, as I ghesse.
1180   <S {Bark}.> My Lord of Hereford, my Message is to you.
1181   <S {Bull}.> My Lord, my Answere is to {Lancaster},
1182   And I am come to seeke that Name in England,
1183   And I must finde that Title in your Tongue,
1184   Before I make reply to aught you say.
1185  *<S {Bark}.> Mistake me not, my Lord, 'tis not my meaning
1186   To raze one Title of your Honor out.
1187   To you, my Lord, I come (what Lord you will)
1188   From the most glorious of this Land,
1189   The Duke of Yorke, to know what pricks you on
1190   To take aduantage of the absent time,
1191   And fright our Natiue Peace with selfe- borne Armes.
1192   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
1193   <S {Bull}.> I shall not need transport my words by you,
1194   Here comes his Grace in Person. My Noble Vnckle.
1195   <S {York}.> Shew me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
1196   Whose dutie is deceiuable, and false.
1197   <S {Bull}.> My gracious Vnckle.
1198   <S {York}.> Tut, tut, Grace me no Grace, nor Vnckle me,
1199   I am no Traytors Vnckle; and that word Grace,
1200   In an vngracious mouth, is but prophane.
1201   Why haue these banish'd, and forbidden Legges,
1202   Dar'd once to touch a Dust of Englands Ground?
1203   But more then why, why haue they dar'd to march
1204   So many miles vpon her peacefull Bosome,
1205   Frighting her pale- fac'd Villages with Warre,
1206   And ostentation of despised Armes?
1207   Com'st thou because th' anoynted King is hence?
1208   Why foolish Boy, the King is left behind,
1209   And in my loyall Bosome lyes his power.
1210   Were I but now the Lord of such hot youth,
1211   As when braue {Gaunt}, thy Father, and my selfe
1212   Rescued the {Black Prince}, that yong {Mars} of men,
1213   From forth the Rankes of many thousand French:
1214   Oh then, how quickly should this Arme of mine,
1215   Now Prisoner to the Palsie, chastise thee,
1216   And minister correction to thy Fault.
1217   <S {Bull}.> My gracious Vnckle, let me know my Fault,
1218   On what Condition stands it, and wherein?
1219   <S {York}.> Euen in Condition of the worst degree,
1220   In grosse Rebellion, and detested Treason:
1221   Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
1222   Before th' expiration of thy time,
1223   In brauing Armes against thy Soueraigne.
1224   <S {Bull}.> As I was banish'd, I was banish'd {Hereford},
1225   But as I come, I come for {Lancaster}.
1226   And Noble Vnckle, I beseech your Grace
1227   Looke on my Wrongs with an indifferent eye:
1228   You are my Father, for me thinkes in you
1229   I see old {Gaunt} aliue. Oh then my Father,
1230   Will you permit, that I shall stand condemn'd
1231   A wandring Vagabond; my Rights and Royalties
1232   Pluckt from my armes perforce, and giuen away
1233   To vpstart Vnthrifts? Wherefore was I borne?
1234   If that my Cousin King, be King of England,
1235   It must be graunted, I am Duke of Lancaster.
1236   You haue a Sonne, {Aumerle}, my Noble Kinsman,
1237   Had you first died, and he beene thus trod downe,
1238   He should haue found his Vnckle {Gaunt} a Father,
1239   To rowze his Wrongs, and chase them to the bay.
1240   I am denyde to sue my Liuerie here,
1241   And yet my Letters Patents giue me leaue:
1242   My Fathers goods are all distraynd, and sold,
1243   And these, and all, are all amisse imployd.
      <P c5>
1244   What would you haue me doe? I am a Subiect,
1245   And challenge Law: Attorneyes are deny'd me;
1246   And therefore personally I lay my claime
1247   To my Inheritance of free Discent.
1248  *<S {North}.> The Noble Duke hath been too much abus'd.
1249   <S {Ross}.> It stands your Grace vpon, to doe him right.
1250   <S {Willo}.> Base men by his endowments are made great.
1251   <S {York}.> My Lords of England, let me tell you this,
1252   I haue had feeling of my Cosens Wrongs,
1253   And labour'd all I could to doe him right:
1254   But in this kind, to come in brauing Armes,
1255   Be his owne Caruer, and cut out his way,
1256   To find out Right with Wrongs, it may not be;
1257   And you that doe abett him in this kind,
1258   Cherish Rebellion, and are Rebels all.
1259  *<S {North}.> The Noble Duke hath sworne his comming is
1260   But for his owne; and for the right of that,
1261   Wee all haue strongly sworne to giue him ayd,
1262   And let him neu'r see Ioy, that breakes that Oath.
1263   <S {York}.> Well, well, I see the issue of these Armes,
1264   I cannot mend it, I must needes confesse,
1265   Because my power is weake, and all #ill left:
1266   But if I could, by him that gaue me life,
1267   I would attach you all, and make you stoope
1268   Vnto the Soueraigne Mercy of the King.
1269   But since I cannot, be it knowne to you,
1270   I doe remaine as Neuter. So fare you well,
1271   Vnlesse you please to enter in the Castle,
1272   And there repose you for this Night.
1273   <S {Bull}.> An offer Vnckle, that wee will accept:
1274   But wee must winne your Grace to goe with vs
1275   To Bristow Castle, which they say is held
1276   By {Bushie}, {Bagot}, and their Complices,
1277   The Caterpillers of the Commonwealth,
1278   Which I haue sworne to weed, and plucke away.
1279  *<S {York}.> It may be I will go with you: but yet Ile pawse,
1280   For I am loth to breake our Countries Lawes:
1281   Nor Friends, nor Foes, to me welcome you are,
1282   Things past redresse, are now with me past care.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1283   <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
1284   <D {Enter Salisbury, and a Captaine}.>
1285  *<S {Capt}.> My Lord of Salisbury, we haue stayd ten dayes,
1286   And hardly kept our Countreymen together,
1287   And yet we heare no tidings from the King;
1288   Therefore we will disperse our selues: farewell.
1289   <S {Sal}.> Stay yet another day, thou trustie Welchman,
1290   The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.
1291  *<S {Capt}.> 'Tis thought the King is dead, we will not stay;
1292   The Bay- trees in our Countrey all are wither'd,
1293   And Meteors fright the fixed Starres of Heauen;
1294   The pale- fac'd Moone lookes bloody on the Earth,
1295   And leane- look'd Prophets whisper fearefull change;
1296   Rich men looke sad, and Ruffians dance and leape,
1297   The one in feare, to loose what they enioy,
1298   The other to enioy by Rage, and Warre:
1299   These signes fore- run the death of Kings.
1300   Farewell, our Countreymen are gone and fled,
1301   As well assur'd {Richard} their King is dead.  <D {Exit}.>
1302   <S {Sal}.> Ah {Richard}, with eyes of heauie mind,
1303   I see thy Glory, like a shooting Starre,
1304   Fall to the base Earth, from the Firmament:
1305   Thy Sunne sets weeping in the lowly West,
1306   Witnessing Stormes to come, Woe, and Vnrest:
1307   Thy Friends are fled, to wait vpon thy Foes,
1308   And crossely to thy good, all fortune goes.  <D {Exit}.>
1309   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1310   <D {Enter Bullingbrooke, Yorke, Northumberland},
1311   {Rosse, Percie, Willoughby, with Bushie}
1312   {and Greene Prisoners}.>
1313   <S {Bull}.> Bring forth these men:
1314   {#Bushie} and {Greene}, I will not vex your soules,
1315   (Since presently your soules must part your bodies)
1316   With too much vrging your pernitious liues,
1317   For 'twere no Charitie: yet to wash your blood
1318   From off my hands, here in the view of men,
1319   I will vnfold some causes of your deaths.
1320   You haue mis- led a Prince, a Royall King,
1321   A happie Gentleman in Blood, and Lineaments,
1322   By you vnhappied, and disfigur'd cleane:
1323   You haue in manner with your sinfull houres
1324   Made a Diuorce betwixt his Queene and him,
1325   Broke the possession of a Royall Bed,
1326   And stayn'd the beautie of a faire Queenes Cheekes,
1327  *With teares drawn fro[m] her eyes, with your foule wrongs.
1328   My selfe a Prince, by fortune of my birth,
1329   Neere to the King in blood, and neere in loue,
1330   Till you did make him mis- interprete me,
1331   Haue stoopt my neck vnder your iniuries,
1332   And sigh'd my English breath in forraine Clouds,
1333   Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
1334   While you haue fed vpon my Seignories,
1335   Dis- park'd my Parkes, and fell'd my Forrest Woods;
1336  *From mine owne Windowes torne my Household Coat,
1337   Raz'd out my Impresse, leauing me no signe,
1338   Saue mens opinions, and my liuing blood,
1339   To shew the World I am a Gentleman.
1340   This, and much more, much more then twice all this,
1341   Condemnes you to the death: see them deliuered ouer
1342   To execution, and the hand of death.
1343   <S {Bushie}.> More welcome is the stroake of death to me,
1344   Then {Bullingbrooke} to England.
1345  *<S {Greene}.> My comfort is, that Heauen will take our soules,
1346   And plague Iniustice with the paines of #Hell.
1347  *<S {Bull}.> My Lord {Northumberland}, see them dispatch'd:
1348   Vnckle, you say the Queene is at your House,
1349   For Heauens sake fairely let her be entreated,
1350   Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
1351   Take speciall care my Greetings be deliuer'd.
1352   <S {York}.> A Gentleman of mine I haue dispatch'd
1353   With Letters of your loue, to her at large.
1354   <S {Bull}.> Thankes gentle Vnckle: come Lords away,
1355   To fight with {Glendoure}, and his Complices;
1356   #A while to worke, and after holliday.
1357   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P c5v>
1358   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1359   <D {Drums: Flourish, and Colours}.
1360   {Enter Richard, Aumerle, Carlile, and Souldiers}.>
1361   <S {Rich}.> Barkloughly Castle call you this at hand?
1362  *<S {Au}.> Yea, my Lord: how brooks your Grace the ayre,
1363   After your late tossing on the breaking Seas?
1364   <S {Rich}.> Needs must I like it well: I weepe for ioy
1365   To stand vpon my Kingdome once againe.
1366   Deere Earth, I doe salute thee with my hand,
1367   Though Rebels wound thee with their Horses hoofes:
1368   As a long parted Mother with her Child,
1369   Playes fondly with her teares, and smiles in meeting;
1370   So weeping, smiling, greet I thee my Earth,
1371   And doe thee fauor with my Royall hands.
1372   Feed  not thy Soueraignes Foe, my gentle Earth,
1373   Nor with thy Sweetes, comfort his rauenous sence:
1374   But let thy Spiders, that suck vp thy Venome,
1375   And heauie- gated Toades lye in their way,
1376   Doing annoyance to the trecherous feete,
1377   Which with vsurping steps doe trample thee.
1378   Yeeld stinging Nettles to mine Enemies;
1379   And when they from thy Bosome pluck a Flower,
1380   Guard it I prethee with a lurking Adder,
1381   Whose double tongue may with a mortall touch
1382   Throw death vpon thy Soueraignes Enemies.
1383   Mock not my sencelesse Coniuration, Lords;
1384   This Earth shall haue a feeling, and these Stones
1385   Proue armed Souldiers, ere her Natiue King
1386   Shall falter vnder foule Rebellious Armes.
1387  *<S {Car}.> Feare not my Lord, that Power that made you King
1388   Hath power to keepe you King, in spight of all.
1389   <S {Aum}.> He meanes, my Lord, that we are too remisse,
1390   Whilest {Bullingbrooke} through our securitie,
1391   Growes strong and great, in substance and in friends.
1392   <S {Rich}.> Discomfortable Cousin, knowest thou not,
1393   That when the searching Eye of Heauen is hid
1394   Behind the Globe, that lights the lower World,
1395   Then Theeues and Robbers raunge abroad vnseene,
1396   In Murthers and in Out- rage bloody here:
1397   But when from vnder this Terrestriall Ball
1398   He fires the prowd tops of the Easterne Pines,
1399   And darts his Lightning through eu'ry guiltie hole,
1400   Then Murthers, Treasons, and detested sinnes
1401  *(The Cloake of Night being pluckt from off their backs)
1402   Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselues.
1403   So when this Theefe, this Traytor {Bullingbrooke},
1404   Who all this while hath reuell'd in the Night,
1405   Shall see vs rising in our Throne, the East,
1406   His Treasons will sit blushing in his face,
1407   Not able to endure the sight of Day;
1408   But selfe- affrighted, tremble at his sinne.
1409   Not all the Water in the rough rude Sea
1410   Can wash the Balme from an anoynted King;
1411   The breath of worldly men cannot depose
1412   The Deputie elected by the Lord:
1413   For euery man that {Bullingbrooke} hath prest,
1414   To lift shrewd Steele against our Golden Crowne,
1415   Heauen for his {Richard} hath in heauenly pay
1416   A glorious Angell: then if Angels fight,
1417   Weake men must fall, for Heauen still guards the right.
1418   <D {Enter Salisbury}.>
1419   Welcome my Lord, how farre off lyes your Power?
1420   <S {Salisb}.> Nor neere, nor farther off, my gracious Lord,
1421   Then this weake arme; discomfort guides my tongue,
1422   And bids me speake of nothing but despaire:
1423   One day too late, I feare (my Noble Lord)
1424   Hath clouded all thy happie dayes on Earth:
1425   Oh call backe Yesterday, bid Time returne,
1426   And thou shalt haue twelue thousand fighting men:
1427   To day, to day, vnhappie day too late
1428   Orethrowes thy Ioyes, Friends, Fortune, and thy State;
1429   For all the Welchmen hearing thou wert dead,
1430   Are gone to {Bullingbrooke}, disperst, and fled.
1431  *<S {Aum}.> Comfort my Liege, why lookes your Grace so
1432   pale?
1433   <S {Rich}.> But now the blood of twentie thousand men
1434   Did triumph in my face, and they are fled,
1435   And till so much blood thither come againe,
1436   Haue I not reason to looke pale, and dead?
1437   All Soules that will be safe, flye from my side,
1438   For Time hath set a blot vpon my pride.
1439   <S {Aum}.> Comfort my Liege, remember who you are.
1440   <S {Rich}.> I had forgot my selfe. Am I not King?
1441   Awake thou sluggard Maiestie, thou sleepest:
1442   Is not the Kings Name fortie thousand Names?
1443   Arme, arme my Name: a punie subiect strikes
1444   At thy great glory. Looke not to the ground,
1445   Ye Fauorites of a King: are wee not high?
1446   High be our thoughts: I know my Vnckle {Yorke}
1447   Hath Power enough to serue our turne.
1448   But who comes here?  <D {Enter Scroope}.>
1449  *<S {Scroope}.> More health and happinesse betide my Liege,
1450   Then can my care- tun'd tongue deliuer him.
1451   <S {Rich}.> Mine eare is open, and my heart prepar'd:
1452   The worst is worldly losse, thou canst vnfold:
1453   Say, Is my Kingdome lost? why 'twas my Care:
1454   And what losse is it to be rid of Care?
1455   Striues {Bullingbrooke} to be as Great as wee?
1456   Greater he shall not be: If hee serue God,
1457   Wee'l serue him too, and be his Fellow so.
1458   Reuolt our Subiects? That we cannot mend,
1459   They breake their Faith to God, as well as vs:
1460   Cry Woe, Destruction, Ruine, Losse, Decay,
1461   The worst is Death, and Death will haue his day.
1462   <S {Scroope}.> Glad am I, that your Highnesse is so arm'd
1463   To beare the tidings of Calamitie.
1464   Like an vnseasonable stormie day,
1465   Which make the Siluer Riuers drowne their Shores,
1466   As if the World were all dissolu'd to teares:
1467   So high, aboue his Limits, swells the Rage
1468   Of {Bullingbrooke}, couering your fearefull Land
1469   With hard bright Steele, and hearts harder then Steele:
1470   White Beares haue arm'd their thin and hairelesse Scalps
1471  *Against thy Maiestie, and Boyes with Womens Voyces,
1472   Striue to speake bigge, and clap their female ioints
1473   In stiffe vnwieldie Armes: against thy Crowne
1474   Thy very Beads- men learne to bend their Bowes
1475   Of double fatall Eugh: against thy State
1476   Yea Distaffe- Women manage rustie Bills:
1477   Against thy Seat both young and old rebell,
1478   And all goes worse then I haue power to tell.
1479   <S {Rich}.> Too well, too well thou tell'st a Tale so #ill.
1480   Where is the Earle of Wiltshire? where is {Bagot}?
1481   What is become of {Bushie}? where is {Greene}?
      <P c6>
1482   That they haue let the dangerous Enemie
1483   Measure our Confines with such peacefull steps?
1484   If we preuaile, their heads shall pay for it.
1485   I warrant they haue made peace with {Bullingbrooke}.
1486  *<S {Scroope}.> Peace haue they made with him indeede (my
1487   Lord.)
1488  *<S {Rich}.> Oh Villains, Vipers, damn'd without redemption,
1489   Dogges, easily woon to fawne on any man,
1490   Snakes in my heart blood warm'd, that sting my heart,
1491   Three Iudasses, each one thrice worse then {Iudas},
1492   Would they make peace? terrible #Hell make warre
1493   Vpon their spotted Soules for this Offence.
1494   <S {Scroope}.> Sweet Loue (I see) changing his propertie,
1495   Turnes to the sowrest, and most deadly hate:
1496   Againe vncurse their Soules; their peace is made
1497  *With Heads, and not with Hands: those whom you curse
1498   Haue felt the worst of Deaths destroying hand,
1499   And lye full low, grau'd in the hollow ground.
1500  *<S {Aum}.> Is {Bushie}, {Greene}, and the Earle of Wiltshire
1501   dead?
1502   <S {Scroope}.> Yea, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
1503  *<S {Aum}.> Where is the Duke my Father with his Power?
1504   <S {Rich}.> No matter where; of comfort no man speake:
1505   Let's talke of Graues, of Wormes, and Epitaphs,
1506   Make Dust our Paper, and with Raynie eyes
1507   Write Sorrow on the Bosome of the Earth.
1508   Let's chuse Executors, and talke of Wills:
1509   And yet not so; for what can we bequeath,
1510   Saue our deposed bodies to the ground?
1511   Our Lands, our Liues, and all are {Bullingbrookes},
1512   And nothing can we call our owne, but Death,
1513   And that small Modell of the barren Earth,
1514   Which serues as Paste, and Couer to our Bones:
1515   For Heauens sake let vs sit vpon the ground,
1516   And tell sad stories of the death of Kings:
1517   How some haue been depos'd, some slaine in warre,
1518   Some haunted by the Ghosts they haue depos'd,
1519   Some poyson'd by their Wiues, some sleeping kill'd,
1520   All murther'd. For within the hollow Crowne
1521   That rounds the mortall Temples of a King,
1522   Keepes Death his Court, and there the Antique sits
1523   Scoffing his State, and grinning at his Pompe,
1524   Allowing him a breath, a little Scene,
1525   To Monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with lookes,
1526   Infusing him with selfe and vaine conceit,
1527   As if this Flesh, which walls about our Life,
1528   Were Brasse impregnable: and humor'd thus,
1529   Comes at the last, and with a little Pinne
1530   Bores through his Castle Walls, and farwell King.
1531   Couer your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
1532   With solemne Reuerence: throw away Respect,
1533   Tradition, Forme, and Ceremonious dutie,
1534   For you haue but mistooke me all this while:
1535   I liue with Bread like you, feele Want,
1536   Taste Griefe, need Friends: subiected thus,
1537   How can you say to me, I am a King?
1538   <S {Carl}.> My Lord, wise men ne're waile their present woes,
1539   But presently preuent the wayes to waile:
1540   To feare the Foe, since feare oppresseth strength,
1541   Giues in your weakenesse, strength vnto your Foe;
1542   Feare, and be slaine, no worse can come to sight,
1543   And fight and die, is death destroying death,
1544   Where fearing, dying, payes death seruile breath.
1545   <S {Aum}.> My Father hath a Power, enquire of him;
1546   And learne to make a Body of a Limbe.
1547  *<S {Rich}.> Thou chid'st me well: proud {Bullingbrooke} I come
1548   To change Blowes with thee, for our day of Doome:
1549   This ague fit of feare is ouer- blowne,
1550   An easie taske it is to winne our owne.
1551   Say {Scroope}, where lyes our Vnckle with his Power?
1552   Speake sweetly man, although thy lookes be sowre.
1553   <S {Scroope}.> Men iudge by the complexion of the Skie
1554   The state and inclination of the day;
1555   So may you by my dull and heauie Eye:
1556   My Tongue hath but a heauier Tale to say:
1557   I play the Torturer, by small and small
1558   To lengthen out the worst, that must be spoken.
1559   Your Vnckle {Yorke} is ioyn'd with {Bullingbrooke},
1560   And all your Northerne Castles yeelded vp,
1561   And all your Southerne Gentlemen in Armes
1562   Vpon his Faction.
1563   <S {Rich}.> Thou hast said enough.
1564   Beshrew thee Cousin, which didst lead me forth
1565   Of that sweet way I was in, to despaire:
1566   What say you now? What comfort haue we now?
1567   By Heauen Ile hate him euerlastingly,
1568   That bids me be of comfort any more.
1569   Goe to Flint Castle, there Ile pine away,
1570   A King, Woes slaue, shall Kingly Woe obey:
1571   That Power I haue, discharge, and let 'em goe
1572   To eare the Land, that hath some hope to grow,
1573   For I haue none. Let no man speake againe
1574   To alter this, for counsaile is but vaine.
1575   <S {Aum}.> My Liege, one word.
1576   <S {Rich}.> He does me double wrong,
1577   That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
1578   Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
1579   From {Richards} Night, to {Bullingbrookes} faire Day.
1580   <D {Exeunt}.>
1581   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1582   <D {Enter with Drum and Colours, Bullingbrooke},
1583   {Yorke, Northumberland, Attendants}.>
1584   <S {Bull}.> So that by this intelligence we learne
1585   The Welchmen are dispers'd, and {Salisbury}
1586   Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed
1587   With some few priuate friends, vpon this Coast.
1588   <S {North}.> The newes is very faire and good, my Lord,
1589   {#Richard}, not farre from hence, hath hid his head.
1590   <S {York}.> It would beseeme the Lord Northumberland,
1591   To say King {Richard}: alack the heauie day,
1592   When such a sacred King should hide his head.
1593   <S {North}.> Your Grace mistakes: onely to be briefe,
1594   Left I his Title out.
1595   <S {York}.> The time hath beene,
1596   Would you haue beene so briefe with him, he would
1597   Haue beene so briefe with you, to shorten you,
1598   For taking so the Head, your whole heads length.
1599   <S {Bull}.> Mistake not (Vnckle) farther then you should.
1600  *<S {York}.> Take not (good Cousin) farther then you should.
1601   Least you mistake the Heauens are ore your head.
1602   <S {Bull}.> I know it (Vnckle) and oppose not my selfe
1603   Against their #will. But who comes here?
1604   <D {Enter Percie}.>
1605   Welcome {Harry}: what, will not this Castle yeeld?
1606   <S {Per}.> The Castle royally is mann'd, my Lord,
1607   Against thy entrance.
      <P c6v>
1608   <S {Bull}.> Royally? Why, it containes no King?
1609   <S {Per}.> Yes (my good Lord)
1610   It doth containe a King: King {Richard} lyes
1611   Within the limits of yond Lime and Stone,
1612   And with him, the Lord {Aumerle}, Lord {Salisbury},
1613   Sir {Stephen Scroope}, besides a Clergie man
1614   Of holy reuerence; who, I cannot learne.
1615   <S {North}.> Oh, belike it is the Bishop of Carlile.
1616   <S {Bull}.> Noble Lord,
1617   Goe to the rude Ribs of that ancient Castle,
1618   Through Brazen Trumpet send the breath of Parle
1619   Into his ruin'd Eares, and thus deliuer:
1620   {Henry Bullingbrooke} vpon his knees doth kisse
1621   King {Richards} hand, and sends allegeance
1622  *And true faith of heart to his Royall Person: hither come
1623   Euen at his feet, to lay my Armes and Power,
1624   Prouided, that my Banishment repeal'd,
1625   And Lands restor'd againe, be freely graunted:
1626   If not, Ile vse th 'aduantage of my Power,
1627   And lay the Summers dust with showers of blood,
1628   Rayn'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen;
1629  *The which, how farre off from the mind of {Bullingbrooke}
1630   It is, such Crimson Tempest should bedrench
1631   The fresh greene Lap of faire King {Richards} Land,
1632   My stooping dutie tenderly shall shew.
1633   Goe signifie as much, while here we march
1634   Vpon the Grassie Carpet of this Plaine:
1635   Let's march without the noyse of threatning Drum,
1636   That from this Castles tatter'd Battlements
1637   Our faire Appointments may be well perus'd.
1638   Me thinkes King {Richard} and my selfe should meet
1639   With no lesse terror then the Elements
1640   Of Fire and Water, when their thundring smoake
1641   At meeting teares the cloudie Cheekes of Heauen:
1642   Be he the fire, Ile be the yeelding Water;
1643   The Rage be his, while on the Earth I raine
1644   My Waters on the Earth, and not on him.
1645   March on, and marke King {Richard} how he lookes.
1646  *<D {Parle without, and answere within: then a Flourish}.
1647  *{Enter on the Walls, Richard, Carlile, Aumerle, Scroop},
1648   {Salisbury}.>
1649   See, see, King {Richard} doth himselfe appeare
1650   As doth the blushing discontented Sunne,
1651   From out the fierie Portall of the East,
1652   When he perceiues the enuious Clouds are bent
1653   To dimme his glory, and to staine the tract
1654   Of his bright passage to the Occident.
1655   <S {York}.> Yet lookes he like a King: behold his Eye
1656   (As bright as is the Eagles) lightens forth
1657   Controlling Maiestie: alack, alack, for woe,
1658   That any harme should staine so faire a shew.
1659   <S {Rich}.> Wee are amaz'd, and thus long haue we stood
1660   To watch the fearefull bending of thy knee,
1661   Because we thought our selfe thy lawfull King:
1662   And if we be, how dare thy ioynts forget
1663   To pay their awfull dutie to our presence?
1664   If we be not, shew vs the Hand of God,
1665   That hath dismiss'd vs from our Stewardship,
1666   For well wee know, no Hand of Blood and Bone
1667   Can gripe the sacred Handle of our Scepter,
1668   Vnlesse he doe prophane, steale, or vsurpe.
1669   And though you thinke, that all, as you haue done,
1670   Haue torne their Soules, by turning them from vs,
1671   And we are barren, and bereft of Friends:
1672   Yet know, my Master, God Omnipotent,
1673   Is mustring in his Clouds, on our behalfe,
1674   Armies of Pestilence, and they shall strike
1675   Your Children yet vnborne, and vnbegot,
1676   That lift your Vassall Hands against my Head,
1677   And threat the Glory of my precious Crowne.
1678   Tell {Bullingbrooke}, for yond me thinkes he is,
1679   That euery stride he makes vpon my Land,
1680   Is dangerous Treason: He is come to ope
1681   The purple Testament of bleeding Warre;
1682   But ere the Crowne he lookes for, liue in peace,
1683   Ten thousand bloody crownes of Mothers Sonnes
1684   Shall #ill become the flower of Englands face,
1685   Change the complexion of her Maid- pale Peace
1686   To Scarlet Indignation, and bedew
1687   Her Pastors Grasse with faithfull English Blood.
1688  *<S {North}.> The King of Heauen forbid our Lord the King
1689   Should so with ciuill and vnciuill Armes
1690   Be rush'd vpon: Thy thrice- noble Cousin,
1691   {Harry Bullingbrooke}, doth humbly kisse thy hand,
1692   And by the Honorable Tombe he sweares,
1693   That stands vpon your Royall Grandsires Bones,
1694   And by the Royalties of both your Bloods,
1695   (Currents that spring from one most gracious Head)
1696   And by the buried Hand of Warlike {Gaunt},
1697   And by the Worth and Honor of himselfe,
1698   Comprising all that may be sworne, or said,
1699   His comming hither hath no further scope,
1700   Then for his Lineall Royalties, and to begge
1701   Infranchisement immediate on his knees:
1702   Which on thy Royall partie graunted once,
1703   His glittering Armes he will commend to Rust,
1704   His barbed Steedes to Stables, and his heart
1705   To faithfull seruice of your Maiestie:
1706   This sweares he, as he is a Prince, is iust,
1707   And as I am a Gentleman, I credit him.
1708   <S {Rich}.> {Northumberland}, say thus: The King returnes,
1709   His Noble Cousin is right welcome hither,
1710   And all the number of his faire demands
1711   Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
1712   With all the gracious vtterance thou hast,
1713   Speake to his gentle hearing kind commends.
1714   We doe debase our selfe (Cousin) doe we not,
1715   To looke so poorely, and to speake so faire?
1716   Shall we call back {Northumberland}, and send
1717   Defiance to the Traytor, and so die?
1718  *<S {Aum}.> No, good my Lord, let's fight with gentle words,
1719  *Till time lend friends, and friends their helpeful Swords.
1720   <S {Rich}.> Oh God, oh God, that ere this tongue of mine,
1721   That layd the Sentence of dread Banishment
1722   On yond prowd man, should take it off againe
1723   With words of sooth: Oh that I were as great
1724   As is my Griefe, or lesser then my Name,
1725   Or that I could forget what I haue beene,
1726   Or not remember what I must be now:
1727   Swell'st thou prowd heart? Ile giue thee scope to beat,
1728   Since Foes haue scope to beat both thee and me.
1729  *<S {Aum}.> {Northumberland} comes backe from {Bulling-brooke}.
1730  _
1731  *<S {Rich}.> What must the King doe now? must he submit?
1732   The King shall doe it: Must he be depos'd?
1733   The King shall be contented: Must he loose
1734   The Name of King? #o' Gods Name let it goe.
1735   Ile giue my Iewels for a sett of Beades,
1736   My gorgeous Pallace, for a Hermitage,
1737   My gay Apparrell, for an Almes- mans Gowne,
1738   My figur'd Goblets, for a Dish of Wood,
1739   My Scepter, for a Palmers walking Staffe,
      <P d1>
1740   My Subiects, for a payre of carued Saints,
1741   And my large Kingdome, for a little Graue,
1742   A little little Graue, an obscure Graue.
1743   Or Ile be buryed in the Kings high- way,
1744   Some way of common Trade, where Subiects feet
1745   May howrely trample on their Soueraignes Head:
1746   For on my heart they tread now, whilest I liue;
1747   And buryed once, why not vpon my Head?
1748   {Aumerle}, thou weep'st (my tender- hearted Cousin)
1749   Wee'le make foule Weather with despised Teares:
1750   Our sighes, and they, shall lodge the Summer Corne,
1751   And make a Dearth in this reuolting Land.
1752   Or shall we play the Wantons with our Woes,
1753   And make some prettie Match, with shedding Teares?
1754   As thus: to drop them still vpon one place,
1755   Till they haue fretted vs a payre of Graues,
1756   Within the Earth: and therein lay'd, there lyes
1757  *Two Kinsmen, digg'd their Graues with weeping Eyes?
1758   Would not this #ill, doe well? Well, well, I see
1759   I talke but idly, and you mock at mee.
1760   Most mightie Prince, my Lord {Northumberland},
1761   What sayes King {Bullingbrooke}? Will his Maiestie
1762   Giue {Richard} leaue to liue, till {Richard} die?
1763   You make a Legge, and {Bullingbrooke} sayes #I.
1764   <S {North}.> My Lord, in the base Court he doth attend
1765   To speake with you, may it please you to come downe.
1766   <S {Rich}.> Downe, downe I come, like glist'ring {Phaeton},
1767   Wanting the manage of vnruly Iades.
1768   In the base Court? base Court, where Kings grow base,
1769   To come at Traytors Calls, and doe them Grace.
1770  *In the base Court come down: down Court, down King,
1771  *For night- Owls shrike, where mou[n]ting Larks should sing.
1772   <S {Bull}.> What sayes his Maiestie?
1773   <S {North}.> Sorrow, and griefe of heart
1774   Makes him speake fondly, like a frantick man:
1775   Yet he is come.
1776   <S {Bull}.> Stand all apart,
1777   And shew faire dutie to his Maiestie.
1778   My gracious Lord.
1779   <S {Rich}.> Faire Cousin,
1780   You debase your Princely Knee,
1781   To make the base Earth prowd with kissing it.
1782   Me rather had, my Heart might feele your Loue,
1783   Then my vnpleas'd Eye see your Courtesie.
1784   Vp Cousin, vp, your Heart is vp, I know,
1785   Thus high at least, although your Knee be low.
1786  *<S {Bull}.> My gracious Lord, I come but for mine
1787   owne.
1788  *<S {Rich}.> Your owne is yours, and I am yours, and
1789   all.
1790   <S {Bull}.> So farre be mine, my most redoubted Lord,
1791   As my true seruice shall deserue your loue.
1792   <S {Rich}.> Well you deseru'd:
1793   They well deserue to haue,
1794   That know the strong'st, and surest way to get.
1795   Vnckle giue me your Hand: nay, drie your Eyes,
1796   Teares shew their Loue, but want their Remedies.
1797   Cousin, I am too young to be your Father,
1798   Though you are old enough to be my Heire.
1799   What you will haue, Ile giue, and willing #to,
1800   For doe we must, what force will haue vs doe.
1801   Set on towards London:
1802   Cousin, is it so?
1803   <S {Bull}.> Yea, my good Lord.
1804   <S {Rich}.> Then I must not say, no.
1805   <D {Flourish}.>  <D {Exeunt}.>
1806   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1807   <D {Enter the Queene, and two Ladies}.>
1808   <S {Qu}.> What sport shall we deuise here in this Garden,
1809   To driue away the heauie thought of Care?
1810   <S {La}.> Madame, wee'le play at Bowles.
1811  *<S {Qu}.> 'Twill make me thinke the World is full of Rubs,
1812   And that my fortune runnes against the Byas.
1813   <S {La}.> Madame, wee'le Dance.
1814   <S {Qu}.> My Legges can keepe no measure in Delight,
1815   When my poore Heart no measure keepes in Griefe.
1816   Therefore no Dancing (Girle) some other sport.
1817   <S {La}.> Madame, wee'le tell Tales.
1818   <S {Qu}.> Of Sorrow, or of Griefe?
1819   <S {La}.> Of eyther, Madame.
1820   <S {Qu}.> Of neyther, Girle.
1821   For if of Ioy, being altogether wanting,
1822   It doth remember me the more of Sorrow:
1823   Or if of Griefe, being altogether had,
1824   It addes more Sorrow to my want of Ioy:
1825   For what I haue, I need not to repeat;
1826   And what I want, it bootes not to complaine.
1827   <S {La}.> Madame, Ile sing.
1828   <S {Qu}.> 'Tis well that thou hast cause:
1829  *But thou should'st please me better, would'st thou weepe.
1830  *<S {La}.> I could weepe, Madame, would it doe you good.
1831   <S {Qu}.> And I could sing, would weeping doe me good,
1832   And neuer borrow any Teare of thee.
1833   <D {Enter a Gardiner, and two Seruants}.>
1834   But stay, here comes the Gardiners,
1835   Let's step into the shadow of these Trees.
1836   My wretchednesse, vnto a Rowe of Pinnes,
1837   They'le talke of State: for euery one doth so,
1838   Against a Change; Woe is fore- runne with Woe.
1839   <S {Gard}.> Goe binde thou vp yond dangling Apricocks,
1840   Which like vnruly Children, make their Syre
1841   Stoupe with oppression of their prodigall weight:
1842   Giue some supportance to the bending twigges.
1843   Goe thou, and like an Executioner
1844   Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprayes,
1845   That looke too loftie in our Common- wealth:
1846   All must be euen, in our Gouernment.
1847   You thus imploy'd, I will goe root away
1848   The noysome Weedes, that without profit sucke
1849   The Soyles fertilitie from wholesome flowers.
1850   <S {Ser}.> Why should we, in the compasse of a Pale,
1851   Keepe Law and Forme, and due Proportion,
1852   Shewing as in a Modell our firme Estate?
1853   When our Sea- walled Garden, the whole Land,
1854   Is full of Weedes, her fairest Flowers choakt vp,
1855   Her Fruit- trees all vnpruin'd, her Hedges ruin'd,
1856   Her Knots disorder'd, and her wholesome Hearbes
1857   Swarming with Caterpillers.
1858   <S {Gard}.> Hold thy peace.
1859   He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd Spring,
1860   Hath now himselfe met with the Fall of Leafe.
1861  *The Weeds that his broad- spreading Leaues did shelter,
1862   That seem'd, in eating him, to hold him vp,
1863   Are pull'd vp, Root and all, by {Bullingbrooke}:
1864   I meane, the Earle of Wiltshire, {Bushie, Greene}.
      <P d1v><C V>
1865   <S {Ser}.> What are they dead?
1866   <S {Gard}.> They are,
1867   And {Bullingbrooke} hath seiz'd the wastefull King.
1868   Oh, what pitty is it, that he had not so trim'd
1869   And drest his Land, as we this Garden, at time of yeare,
1870   And wound the Barke, the skin of our Fruit- trees,
1871   Least being ouer- proud with Sap and Blood,
1872   With too much riches it confound it selfe?
1873   Had he done so, to great and growing men,
1874   They might haue liu'd to beare, and he to taste
1875   Their fruites of dutie. Superfluous branches
1876   We lop away, that bearing boughes may liue:
1877   Had he done so, himselfe had borne the Crowne,
1878  *Which waste and idle houres, hath quite thrown downe.
1879   <S {Ser}.> What thinke you the King shall be depos'd?
1880   <S {Gar}.> Deprest he is already, and depos'd
1881   'Tis doubted he will be. Letters came last night
1882   To a deere Friend of the Duke of Yorkes,
1883   That tell blacke tydings.
1884  *<S {Qu}.> Oh I am prest to death through want of speaking:
1885   Thou old {Adams} likenesse, set to dresse this Garden:
1886  *How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this vnpleasing |(newes
1887   What Eue? what Serpent hath suggested thee,
1888   To make a second fall of cursed man?
1889   Why do'st thou say, King {Richard} is depos'd,
1890   Dar'st thou, thou little better thing then earth,
1891   Diuine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how
1892   Cam'st thou by this ill- tydings? Speake thou wretch.
1893   <S {Gard}.> Pardon me Madam. Little ioy haue I
1894   To breath these newes; yet what I say, is true;
1895   King {Richard}, he is in the mighty hold
1896   Of {Bullingbrooke}, their Fortunes both are weigh'd:
1897   In your Lords Scale, is nothing but himselfe,
1898   And some few Vanities, that make him light:
1899   But in the Ballance of great {Bullingbrooke},
1900   Besides himselfe, are all the English Peeres,
1901   And with that oddes he weighes King {Richard} downe.
1902   Poste you to London, and you'l finde it so,
1903   I speake no more, then euery one doth know.
1904   <S {Qu}.> Nimble mischance, that art so light of foote,
1905   Doth not thy Embassage belong to me?
1906   And am I last that knowes it? Oh thou think'st
1907   To serue me last, that I may longest keepe
1908   Thy sorrow in my breast. Come Ladies goe,
1909   To meet at London, Londons King in woe.
1910   What was I borne to this: that my sad looke,
1911   Should grace the Triumph of great {Bullingbrooke}.
1912   Gard'ner, for telling me this newes of woe,
1913   I would the Plants thou graft'st, may neuer grow.  <D {Exit}.>
1914  *<S {G}.> Poore Queen, so that thy State might be no worse,
1915   I would my skill were subiect to thy curse:
1916   Heere did she drop a teare, heere in this place
1917   Ile set a Banke of Rew, sowre Herbe of Grace:
1918   Rue, eu'n for ruth, heere shortly shall be seene,
1919   In the remembrance of a Weeping Queene.  <D {Exit}.>
1920   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scoena Prima}.>
1921   <D {Enter as to the Parliament, Bullingbrooke, Aumerle, Nor-thumberland},
1922  *{#Percie, Fitz-Water, Surrey, Carlile, Abbot}
1923   {of Westminster. Herauld, Officers, and Bagot}.>
1924   <S {Bullingbrooke}.> Call forth {Bagot}.
1925   Now {Bagot}, freely speake thy minde,
1926   What thou do'st know of Noble Glousters death:
1927   Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd
1928   The bloody Office of his Timelesse end.
1929   <S {Bag}.> Then set before my face, the Lord {Aumerle}.
1930   <S {Bul}.> Cosin, stand forth, and looke vpon that man.
1931  *<S {Bag}.> My Lord {Aumerle}, I know your daring tongue
1932   Scornes to vnsay, what it hath once deliuer'd.
1933   In that dead time, when Glousters death was plotted,
1934   I heard you say, Is not my arme of length,
1935   That reacheth from the restfull English Court
1936   As farre as Callis, to my Vnkles head.
1937   Amongst much other talke, that very time,
1938   I heard you say, that you had rather refuse
1939   The offer of an hundred thousand Crownes,
1940  *Then {Bullingbrookes} returne to England; adding withall,
1941  *How blest this Land would be, in this your Cosins death.
1942   <S {Aum}.> Princes, and Noble Lords:
1943   What answer shall I make to this base man?
1944   Shall I so much dishonor my faire Starres,
1945   On equall termes to giue him chasticement?
1946   Either I must, or haue mine honor soyl'd
1947   With th' Attaindor of his sland'rous Lippes.
1948   There is my Gage, the manuall Seale of death
1949   That markes thee out for #Hell. Thou lyest,
1950   And will maintaine what thou hast said, is false,
1951   In thy heart blood, though being all too base
1952   To staine the temper of my Knightly sword.
1953   <S {Bul}.> {Bagot} forbeare, thou shalt not take it vp.
1954   <S {Aum}.> Excepting one, I would he were the best
1955   In all this presence, that hath mou'd me so.
1956   <S {Fitz}.> If that thy valour stand on sympathize:
1957   There is my Gage, {Aumerle}, in Gage to thine:
1958   By that faire Sunne, that shewes me where thou stand'st,
1959   I heard thee say (and  vauntingly thou spak'st it)
1960   That thou wer't cause of Noble Glousters death.
1961   If thou deniest it, twenty times thou lyest,
1962   And I will turne thy falshood to thy hart,
1963   Where it was forged with my Rapiers point.
1964   <S {Aum}.> Thou dar'st not (Coward) liue to see the day.
1965  *<S {Fitz}.> Now by my Soule, I would it were this houre.
1966   <S {Aum}.> {Fitzwater} thou art damn'd to #hell for this.
1967   <S {Per}.> {Aumerle}, thou lye'st: his Honor is as true
1968   In this Appeale, as thou art all vniust:
1969   And that thou art so, there I throw my Gage
1970   To proue it on thee, to th' extreamest point
1971   Of mortall breathing. Seize it, if thou dar'st.
1972   <S {Aum}.> #And if I do not, may my hands rot off,
1973   And neuer brandish more reuengefull Steele,
1974   Ouer the glittering Helmet of my Foe.
1975   <S {Surrey}.> My Lord {Fitz-water}:
1976   I do remember well, the very time
1977   {Aumerle}, and you did talke.
1978   <S {Fitz}.> My Lord,
1979   'Tis very true: You were in presence then,
1980   And you can witnesse with me, this is true.
1981   <S {Surrey}.> As false, by heauen,
1982   As Heauen it selfe is true.
1983   <S {Fitz}.> Surrey, thou Lyest.
1984   <S {Surrey}.> Dishonourable Boy;
1985   That Lye, shall lie so heauy on my Sword,
1986   That it shall render Vengeance, and Reuenge,
1987   Till thou the Lye- giuer, and that Lye, doe lye
1988   In earth as quiet, as thy Fathers Scull.
1989   In proofe whereof, there is mine Honors pawne,
1990   Engage it to the Triall, if thou dar'st.
      <P d2><C A>
1991  *<S {Fitzw}.> How fondly do'st thou spurre a forward Horse?
1992   If I dare eate, or drinke, or breathe, or liue,
1993   I dare meete {Surrey} in a Wildernesse,
1994   And spit vpon him, whilest I say he Lyes,
1995   And Lyes, and Lyes: there is my Bond of Faith,
1996   To tye thee to my strong Correction.
1997   As I intend to thriue in this new World,
1998   {Aumerle} is guiltie of my true Appeale.
1999   Besides, I heard the banish'd {Norfolke} say,
2000   That thou {Aumerle} didst send two of thy men,
2001   To execute the Noble Duke at Callis.
2002   <S {Aum}.> Some honest Christian trust me with a Gage,
2003   That {Norfolke} lyes: here doe I throw downe this,
2004   If he may be repeal'd, to trie his Honor.
2005   <S {Bull}.> These differences shall all rest vnder Gage,
2006   Till {Norfolke} be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be;
2007   And (though mine Enemie) restor'd againe
2008   To all his Lands and Seignories: when hee's return'd,
2009   Against {Aumerle} we will enforce his Tryall.
2010   <S {Carl}.> That honorable day shall ne're be seene.
2011   Many a time hath banish'd {Norfolke} fought
2012   For Iesu Christ, in glorious Christian field
2013   Streaming the Ensigne of the Christian Crosse,
2014   Against black Pagans, Turkes, and Saracens:
2015   And toyl'd with workes of Warre, retyr'd himselfe
2016   To Italy, and there at Venice gaue
2017   His Body to that pleasant Countries Earth,
2018   And his pure Soule vnto his Captaine Christ,
2019   Vnder whose Colours he had fought so long.
2020   <S {Bull}.> Why Bishop, is {Norfolke} dead?
2021   <S {Carl}.> As sure as I liue, my Lord.
2022   <S {Bull}.> Sweet peace conduct his sweet Soule
2023   To the Bosome of good old {Abraham}.
2024  *Lords Appealants, your differe[n]ces shal all rest vnder gage,
2025   Till we assigne you to your dayes of Tryall.
2026   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
2027   <S {Yorke}.> Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
2028   From plume- pluckt {Richard}, who with willing Soule
2029   Adopts thee Heire, and his high Scepter yeelds
2030   To the possession of thy Royall Hand.
2031   Ascend his Throne, descending now from him,
2032   And long liue {Henry}, of that Name the Fourth.
2033   <S {Bull}.> In Gods Name, Ile ascend the Regall Throne.
2034   <S {Carl}.> Mary, Heauen forbid.
2035   Worst in this Royall Presence may I speake,
2036   Yet best beseeming me to speake the truth.
2037   Would God, that any in this Noble Presence
2038   Were enough Noble, to be vpright Iudge
2039   Of Noble {Richard}: then true Noblenesse would
2040   Learne him forbearance from so foule a Wrong.
2041   What Subiect can giue Sentence on his King?
2042   And who sits here, that is not {Richards} Subiect?
2043   Theeues are not iudg'd, but they are by to heare,
2044   Although apparant guilt be seene in them:
2045   And shall the figure of Gods Maiestie,
2046   His Captaine, Steward, Deputie elect,
2047   Anoynted, Crown'd, planted many yeeres,
2048   Be iudg'd by subiect, and inferior breathe,
2049   And he himselfe not present? Oh, forbid it, God,
2050   That in a Christian Climate, Soules refin'de
2051   Should shew so heynous, black, obscene a deed.
2052   I speake to Subiects, and a Subiect speakes,
2053   Stirr'd vp by Heauen, thus boldly for his King
2054   My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call King,
2055   Is a foule Traytor to prowd {Herefords} King.
2056   And if you Crowne him, let me prophecie,
2057   The blood of English shall manure the ground,
2058   And future Ages groane for his foule Act.
2059   Peace shall goe sleepe with Turkes and Infidels,
2060   And in this Seat of Peace, tumultuous Warres
2061  *Shall Kinne with Kinne, and Kinde with Kinde confound.
2062   Disorder, Horror, Feare, and Mutinie
2063   Shall here inhabite, and this Land be call'd
2064   The field of Golgotha, and dead  mens Sculls.
2065   Oh, if you reare this House, against this House
2066   It will the wofullest Diuision proue,
2067   That euer fell vpon this cursed Earth.
2068   Preuent it, resist it, and let it not be so,
2069   Least Child, Childs Children cry against you, Woe.
2070  *<S {North}.> Well haue you argu'd Sir: and for your paines,
2071   Of Capitall Treason we arrest you here.
2072   My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge,
2073   To keepe him safely, till his day of Tryall.
2074   May it please you, Lords, to grant the Commons Suit?
2075   <S {Bull}.> Fetch hither {Richard}, that in common view
2076   He may surrender: so we shall proceede
2077   Without suspition.
2078   <S {Yorke}.> I will be his Conduct.  <D {Exit}.>
2079   <S {Bull}.> Lords, you that here are vnder our Arrest,
2080   Procure your Sureties for your Dayes of Answer:
2081   Little are we beholding to your Loue,
2082   And little look'd for at your helping Hands.
2083   <D {Enter Richard and Yorke}.>
2084   <S {Rich}.> Alack, why am I sent for to a King,
2085   Before I haue shooke off the Regall thoughts
2086   Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet haue learn'd
2087   To insinuate, flatter, bowe, and bend my Knee.
2088   Giue Sorrow leaue #a while, to tuture me
2089   To this submission. Yet I well remember
2090   The fauors of these men: were they not mine?
2091   Did they not sometime cry, All hayle to me?
2092   So {Iudas} did to Christ: but he in twelue,
2093   Found truth in all, but one; I, in twelue thousand, none.
2094   God saue the King: will no man say, Amen?
2095   Am I both Priest, and Clarke? well then, Amen.
2096   God saue the King, although I be not hee:
2097   And yet Amen, if Heauen doe thinke him mee.
2098   To doe what seruice, am I sent for hither?
2099   <S {Yorke}.> To doe that office of thine owne good #will,
2100   Which tyred Maiestie did make thee offer:
2101   The Resignation of thy State and Crowne
2102   To {Henry Bullingbrooke}.
2103  *<S {Rich}.> Giue me the Crown. Here Cousin, seize y Crown:
2104   Here Cousin, on this side my Hand, on that side thine.
2105   Now is this Golden Crowne like a deepe Well,
2106   That owes two Buckets, filling one another,
2107   The emptier euer dancing in the ayre,
2108   The other downe, vnseene, and full of Water:
2109   That Bucket downe, and full of Teares am I,
2110   Drinking my Griefes, whil'st you mount vp on high.
2111   <S {Bull}.> I thought you had been willing to resigne.
2112   <S {Rich}.> My Crowne I am, but still my Griefes are mine:
2113   You may my Glories and my State depose,
2114   But not my Griefes; still am I King of those.
2115  *<S {Bull}.> Part of your Cares you giue me with your Crowne.
2116   <S {Rich}.> Your Cares set vp, do not pluck my Cares downe.
2117   My Care, is losse of Care, by old Care done,
2118   Your Care, is gaine of Care, by new Care wonne:
2119   The Cares I giue, I haue, though giuen away,
2120   They 'tend the Crowne, yet still with me they stay:
2121   <S {Bull}.> Are you contented to resigne the Crowne?
      <P d2v>
2122   <S {Rich}.> #I, no; no, #I: for I must nothing bee:
2123   Therefore no, no, for I resigne to thee.
2124   Now, marke me how I will vndoe my selfe.
2125   I giue this heauie Weight from off my Head,
2126   And this vnwieldie Scepter from my Hand,
2127   The pride of Kingly sway from out my Heart.
2128   With mine owne Teares I wash away my Balme,
2129   With  mine owne Hands I giue away my Crowne,
2130   With  mine owne Tongue denie my Sacred State,
2131   With mine owne Breath release all dutious Oathes;
2132   All Pompe and Maiestie I doe forsweare:
2133   My Manors, Rents, Reuenues, I forgoe;
2134   My Acts, Decrees, and Statutes I denie:
2135   God pardon all Oathes that are broke to mee,
2136   God keepe all Vowes vnbroke are made to thee.
2137   Make me that nothing haue, with nothing grieu'd,
2138   And thou with all pleas'd, that hast all atchieu'd.
2139   Long may'st thou liue in {Richards} Seat to sit,
2140   And soone lye {Richard} in an Earthie Pit.
2141   God saue King {Henry}, vn- King'd {Richard} sayes,
2142   And send him many yeeres of Sunne- shine dayes.
2143   What more remaines?
2144   <S {North}.> No more: but that you reade
2145   These Accusations, and these grieuous Crymes,
2146   Committed by your Person, and your followers,
2147   Against the State, and Profit of this Land:
2148   That by confessing them, the Soules of men
2149   May deeme, that you are worthily depos'd.
2150   <S {Rich}.> Must I doe so? and must I rauell out
2151   My weau'd- vp follyes? Gentle {Northumberland},
2152   If thy Offences were vpon Record,
2153   Would it not shame thee, in so faire a troupe,
2154   To reade a Lecture of them? If thou would'st,
2155   There should'st thou finde one heynous Article,
2156   Contayning the deposing of a King,
2157   And cracking the strong Warrant of an Oath,
2158   Mark'd with a Blot, damn'd in the Booke of Heauen.
2159   Nay, all of you, that stand and looke vpon me,
2160   Whil'st that my wretchednesse doth bait my selfe,
2161   Though some of you, with {Pilate}, wash your hands,
2162   Shewing an outward pittie: yet you {Pilates}
2163   Haue here deliuer'd me to my sowre Crosse,
2164   And Water cannot wash away your sinne.
2165   <S {North}.> My Lord dispatch, reade o're these Articles.
2166   <S {Rich}.> Mine Eyes are full of Teares, I cannot see:
2167   And yet salt- Water blindes them not so much,
2168   But they can see a sort of Traytors here.
2169   Nay, if I turne mine Eyes vpon my selfe,
2170   I finde my selfe a Traytor with the rest:
2171   For I haue giuen here my Soules consent,
2172   T' vndeck the pompous Body of a King;
2173   Made Glory base; a Soueraigntie, a Slaue;
2174   Prowd Maiestie, a Subiect; State, a Pesant.
2175   <S {North}.> My Lord.
2176   <S {Rich}.> No Lord of thine, thou haught- insulting man;
2177   No, nor no mans Lord: I haue no Name, no Title;
2178   No, not that Name was giuen me at the Font,
2179   But 'tis vsurpt: alack the heauie day,
2180   That I haue worne so many Winters out,
2181   And know not now, what Name to call my selfe.
2182   Oh, that I were a Mockerie, King of Snow,
2183   Standing before the Sunne of {Bullingbrooke},
2184   To melt my selfe away in Water- drops.
2185   Good King, great King, and yet not greatly good,
2186   #And if my word be Sterling yet in England,
2187   Let it command a Mirror hither straight,
2188   That it may shew me what a Face I haue,
2189   Since it is Bankrupt of his Maiestie.
2190   <S {Bull}.> Goe some of you, and fetch a Looking- Glasse.
2191  *<S {North}.> Read o're this Paper, while y Glasse doth come.
2192   <S {Rich}.> Fiend, thou torments me, ere I come to #Hell.
2193   <S {Bull}.> Vrge it no more, my Lord {Northumberland}.
2194   <S {North}.> The Commons will not then be satisfy'd.
2195   <S {Rich}.> They shall be satisfy'd: Ile reade enough,
2196   When I doe see the very Booke indeede,
2197   Where all my sinnes are writ, and that's my selfe.
2198   <D {Enter one with a Glasse}.>
2199   Giue me that Glasse, and therein will I reade.
2200   No deeper wrinckles yet? hath Sorrow strucke
2201   So many Blowes vpon this Face of mine,
2202   And made no deeper Wounds? Oh flatt'ring Glasse,
2203   Like to my followers in prosperitie,
2204   Thou do'st beguile me. Was this Face, the Face
2205   That euery day, vnder his House- hold Roofe,
2206   Did keepe ten thousand men? Was this the Face,
2207   That like the Sunne, did make beholders winke?
2208   Is this the Face, which fac'd so many follyes,
2209   That was at last out- fac'd by {Bullingbrooke}?
2210   A brittle Glory shineth in this Face,
2211   As brittle as the Glory, is the Face,
2212   For there it is, crackt in an hundred shiuers.
2213   Marke silent King, the Morall of this sport,
2214   How soone my Sorrow hath destroy'd my Face.
2215   <S {Bull}.> The shadow of your Sorrow hath destroy'd
2216   The shadow of your Face.
2217   <S {Rich}.> Say that againe.
2218   The shadow of my Sorrow: ha, let's see,
2219   'Tis very true, my Griefe lyes all within,
2220   And these externall manner of Laments,
2221   Are meerely shadowes, to the vnseene Griefe,
2222   That swells with silence in the tortur'd Soule.
2223   There lyes the substance: and I thanke thee King
2224   For thy great bountie, that not onely giu'st
2225   Me cause  to wayle, but teachest me the way
2226   How to lament the cause. Ile begge one Boone,
2227   And then be gone, and trouble you no more.
2228   Shall I obtaine it?
2229   <S {Bull}.> Name it, faire Cousin.
2230   <S {Rich}.> Faire Cousin? I am greater then a King:
2231   For when I was a King, my flatterers
2232   Were then but subiects; being now a subiect,
2233   I haue a King here to my flatterer:
2234   Being so great, I haue no neede to begge.
2235   <S {Bull}.> Yet aske.
2236   <S {Rich}.> And shall I haue?
2237   <S {Bull}.> You shall.
2238   <S {Rich}.> Then giue me leaue to goe.
2239   <S {Bull}.> Whither?
2240   <S {Rich}.> Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
2241   <S {Bull}.> Goe some of you, conuey him to the Tower.
2242   <S {Rich}.> Oh good: conuey: Conueyers are you all,
2243   That rise thus nimbly by a true Kings fall.
2244   <S {Bull}.> On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe
2245   Our Coronation: Lords, prepare your selues.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2246   <S {Abbot}.> A wofull Pageant haue we here beheld.
2247   <S {Carl}.> The Woes to come, the Children yet vnborne,
2248   Shall feele this day as sharpe to them as Thorne.
2249   <S {Aum}.> You holy Clergie- men, is there no Plot
2250   To rid the Realme of this pernicious Blot.
2251   <S {Abbot}.> Before I freely speake my minde herein,
2252   You shall not onely take the Sacrament,
2253   To bury mine intents, but also to effect
      <P d3>
2254   What euer I shall happen to deuise.
2255   I see your Browes are full of Discontent,
2256   Your Heart of Sorrow, and your Eyes of Teares.
2257   Come home with me to Supper, Ile lay a Plot
2258   Shall shew vs all a merry day.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2259   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2260   <D {Enter Queene, and Ladies}.>
2261   <S {Qu}.> This way the King will come: this is the way
2262   To {Iulius Caesars} ill- erected Tower:
2263   To whose flint Bosome, my condemned Lord
2264   Is doom'd a Prisoner, by prowd {Bullingbrooke}.
2265   Here let vs rest, if this rebellious Earth
2266   Haue any resting for her true Kings Queene.
2267   <D {Enter Richard, and Guard}.>
2268   But soft, but see, or rather doe not see,
2269   My faire Rose wither: yet looke vp; behold,
2270   That you in pittie may dissolue to dew,
2271   And wash him fresh againe with true- loue Teares.
2272   Ah thou, the Modell where old Troy did stand,
2273   Thou Mappe of Honor, thou King {Richards} Tombe,
2274   And not King {Richard}: thou most beauteous Inne,
2275   Why should hard- fauor'd Griefe be lodg'd in thee,
2276   When Triumph is become an Ale- house Guest.
2277   <S {Rich}.> Ioyne not with griefe, faire Woman, do not so,
2278   To make my end too sudden: learne good Soule,
2279   To thinke our former State a happie Dreame,
2280   From which awak'd, the truth of what we are,
2281   Shewes vs but this. I am sworne Brother (Sweet)
2282   To grim Necessitie; and hee and I
2283   Will keepe a League till Death. High thee to France,
2284   And Cloyster thee in some Religious House:
2285   Our holy liues must winne a new Worlds Crowne,
2286   Which our prophane houres here haue stricken downe.
2287   <S {Qu}.> What, is my {Richard} both in shape and minde
2288   Transform'd, and weaken'd? Hath {Bullingbrooke}
2289   Depos'd thine Intellect? hath he beene in thy Heart?
2290   The Lyon dying, thrusteth forth his Paw,
2291   And wounds the Earth, if nothing else, with rage
2292   To be o're- powr'd: and wilt thou, Pupill- like,
2293   Take thy Correction mildly, kisse the Rodde,
2294   And fawne on Rage with base Humilitie,
2295   Which art a Lyon, and a King of Beasts?
2296   <S {Rich}.> A King of Beasts indeed: if aught but Beasts,
2297   I had beene still a happy King of Men.
2298   Good (sometime Queene) prepare thee hence for France:
2299   Thinke I am dead, and that euen here thou tak'st,
2300   As from my Death- bed, my last liuing leaue.
2301   In Winters tedious Nights sit by the fire
2302   With good old folkes, and let them tell thee Tales
2303   Of wofull Ages, long agoe betide:
2304   And ere thou bid good- night, to quit their griefe,
2305   Tell thou the lamentable fall of me,
2306   And send the hearers weeping to their Beds:
2307   For why? the sencelesse Brands will sympathize
2308   The heauie accent of thy mouing Tongue,
2309   And in compassion, weepe the fire out:
2310   And some will mourne in ashes, some coale- black,
2311   For the deposing of a rightfull King.
2312   <D {Enter Northumberland}.>
2313   <S {North}.> My Lord, the mind of {Bullingbrooke} is chang'd.
2314   You must to Pomfret, not vnto the Tower.
2315   And Madame, there is order ta'ne for you:
2316   With all swift speed, you must away to France.
2317   <S {Rich}.> {Northumberland}, thou Ladder wherewithall
2318   The mounting {Bullingbrooke} ascends my Throne,
2319   The time shall not be many houres of age,
2320   More then it is, ere foule sinne, gathering head,
2321   Shall breake into corruption: thou shalt thinke,
2322   Though he diuide the Realme, and giue thee halfe,
2323   It is too little, helping him to all:
2324   He shall thinke, that thou which know'st the way
2325   To plant vnrightfull Kings, wilt know againe,
2326   Being ne're so little vrg'd another way,
2327   To pluck him headlong from the vsurped Throne.
2328   The Loue of wicked friends conuerts to Feare;
2329   That Feare, to Hate; and Hate turnes one, or both,
2330   To worthie Danger, and deserued Death.
2331   <S {North}.> My guilt be on my Head, and there an end:
2332   Take leaue, and part, for you must part forthwith.
2333   <S {Rich}.> Doubly diuorc'd? (bad men) ye violate
2334   A two- fold Marriage; 'twixt my Crowne, and me.
2335   And then betwixt me, and my marryed Wife.
2336   Let me vn- kisse the Oath 'twixt thee, and me;
2337   And yet not so, for with a Kisse 'twas made.
2338   Part vs, {Northumberland}: I, towards the North,
2339   Where shiuering Cold and Sicknesse pines the Clyme:
2340  *My Queene to France: from whence, set forth in pompe,
2341   She came adorned hither like sweet #May;
2342   Sent back like Hollowmas, or short'st of day.
2343   <S {Qu}.> And must we be diuided? must we part?
2344  *<S {Rich}.> #I, hand from hand (my Loue) and heart fro[m] heart.
2345   <S {Qu}.> Banish vs both, and send the King with me.
2346   <S {North}.> That were some Loue, but little Pollicy.
2347   <S {Qu}.> Then whither he goes, thither let me goe.
2348   <S {Rich}.> So two together weeping, make one Woe.
2349   Weepe thou for me in France; I, for thee heere:
2350   Better farre off, then neere, be ne're the neere.
2351  *Goe, count thy Way with Sighes; I, mine with Groanes.
2352   <S {Qu}.> So longest Way shall haue the longest Moanes.
2353  *<S {Rich}.> Twice for one step Ile groane, y Way being short,
2354   And peece the Way out with a heauie heart.
2355   Come, come, in wooing Sorrow let's be briefe,
2356   Since wedding it, there is such length in Griefe:
2357   One Kisse shall stop our mouthes, and dumbely part;
2358   Thus giue I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
2359  *<S {Qu}.> Giue me mine owne againe: 'twere no good part,
2360   To take on me to keepe, and kill thy heart.
2361   So, now I haue mine owne againe, be gone,
2362   That I may striue to kill it with a groane.
2363   <S {Rich}.> We make Woe wanton with this fond delay:
2364   Once more adieu; the rest, let Sorrow say.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2365   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
2366   <D {Enter Yorke, and his Duchesse}.>
2367   <S {Duch}.> My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
2368   When weeping made you breake the story off,
2369   Of our two Cousins comming into London.
2370   <S {Yorke}.> Where did I leaue?
2371   <S {Duch}.> At that sad stoppe, my Lord,
2372  *Where rude mis- gouern'd hands, from Windowes tops,
2373   Threw dust and rubbish on King {Richards} head.
      <P d3v><C B>
2374   <S {Yorke}.> Then, as I said, the Duke, great {Bullingbrooke},
2375   Mounted vpon a hot and fierie Steed,
2376   Which his aspiring Rider seem'd to know,
2377   With slow, but stately pace, kept on his course:
2378   While all tongues cride, God saue thee {Bullingbrooke}.
2379   You would haue thought the very windowes spake,
2380   So many greedy lookes of yong and old,
2381   Through Casements darted their desiring eyes
2382   Vpon his visage: and that all the walles,
2383   With painted Imagery had said at once,
2384   Iesu preserue thee, welcom {Bullingbrooke}.
2385   Whil'st he, from one side to the other turning,
2386   Bare- headed, lower then his proud Steeds necke,
2387   Bespake them thus: I thanke you Countrimen:
2388   And thus still doing, thus he past along.
2389  *<S {Dutch}.> Alas poore {Richard}, where rides he the whilst?
2390   <S {Yorke}.> As in a Theater, the eyes of men
2391   After a well grac'd Actor leaues the Stage,
2392   Are idlely bent on him that enters next,
2393   Thinking his prattle to be tedious:
2394   Euen so, or with much more contempt, mens eyes
2395   Did scowle on {Richard}: no man cride, God saue him:
2396   No ioyfull tongue gaue him his welcome home,
2397   But dust was throwne vpon his Sacred head,
2398   Which with such gentle sorrow he shooke off,
2399   His face still combating with teares and smiles
2400   (The badges of his greefe and patience)
2401   That had not God (for  some strong purpose) steel'd
2402   The hearts of men, they must perforce haue melted,
2403   And Barbarisme it selfe haue pittied him.
2404   But heauen hath a hand in these euents,
2405   To whose high #will we bound our calme contents.
2406   To {Bullingbrooke}, are we sworne Subiects now,
2407   Whose State, and Honor, I for aye allow.
2408   <D {Enter Aumerle}.>
2409   <S {Dut}.> Heere comes my sonne {Aumerle}.
2410   <S {Yor}.> {Aumerle} that was,
2411   But that is lost, for being {Richards} Friend.
2412   And Madam, you must call him {Rutland} now:
2413   I am in Parliament pledge for his truth,
2414   And lasting fealtie to the new- made King.
2415  *<S {Dut}.> Welcome my sonne: who are the Violets now,
2416   That strew the greene lap of the new- come Spring?
2417   <S {Aum}.> Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not,
2418   God knowes, I had as liefe be none, as one.
2419  *<S {Yorke}.> Well, beare you well in this new- spring of time
2420   Least you be cropt before you come to prime.
2421  *What newes from Oxford? Hold those Iusts & Triumphs?
2422   <S {Aum}.> For ought I know my Lord, they do.
2423   <S {Yorke}.> You will be there I know.
2424   <S {Aum}.> If God preuent not, I purpose so.
2425  *<S {Yor}.> What Seale is that that hangs without thy bosom?
2426   Yea, look'st thou pale? Let me see the Writing.
2427   <S {Aum}.> My Lord, 'tis nothing.
2428   <S {Yorke}.> No matter then who sees it,
2429   I will be satisfied, let me see the Writing.
2430   <S {Aum}.> I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
2431   It is a matter of small consequence,
2432   Which for some reasons I would not haue seene.
2433   <S {Yorke}.> Which for some reasons sir, I meane to see:
2434   I feare, I feare.
2435   <S {Dut}.> What should you feare?
2436   'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
2437   For gay apparrell, against the Triumph.
2438  *<S {Yorke}.> Bound to himselfe? What doth he with a Bond
2439   That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a foole.
2440   Boy, let me see the Writing.
2441  *<S {Aum}.> I do beseech you pardon me, I may not shew it.
2442   <S {Yor}.> I will be satisfied: let me see it I say.  <D {Snatches it}>
2443   Treason, foule Treason, Villaine, Traitor, Slaue.
2444   <S {Dut}.> What's the matter, my Lord?
2445   <S {Yorke}.> Hoa, who's within there? Saddle my horse.
2446   Heauen for his mercy: what treachery is heere?
2447   <S {Dut}.> Why, what is't my Lord?
2448   <S {Yorke}.> Giue me my boots, I say: Saddle my horse:
2449   Now by my Honor, my life, my troth,
2450   I will appeach #the Villaine.
2451   <S {Dut}.> What is the matter?
2452   <S {Yorke}.> Peace foolish Woman.
2453   <S {Dut}.> I will not peace. What is the matter Sonne?
2454   <S {Aum}.> Good Mother be content, it is no more
2455   Then my poore life must answer.
2456   <S {Dut}.> Thy life answer?
2457   <D {Enter Seruant with Boots}.>
2458   <S {Yor}.> Bring me my Boots, I will vnto the King.
2459   <S {Dut}.> Strike him {Aumerle}. Poore boy, y art amaz'd,
2460   Hence Villaine, neuer more come in my sight.
2461   <S {Yor}.> Giue me my Boots, I say.
2462   <S {Dut}.> Why Yorke, what wilt thou do?
2463   Wilt thou not hide the Trespasse of thine owne?
2464   Haue we more Sonnes? Or are we like to haue?
2465   Is not my teeming date drunke vp with time?
2466   And wilt thou plucke my faire Sonne from mine Age,
2467   And rob me of a happy Mothers name?
2468   Is he not like thee? Is he not thine owne?
2469   <S {Yor}.> Thou fond mad woman:
2470   Wilt thou conceale this darke Conspiracy?
2471   A dozen of them heere haue tane the Sacrament,
2472   And interchangeably set downe their hands
2473   To kill the King at Oxford.
2474   <S {Dut}.> He shall be none:
2475   Wee'l keepe him heere: then what is that to him?
2476  *<S {Yor}.> Away fond woman: were hee twenty times my
2477   Son, I would appeach him.
2478   <S {Dut}.> Hadst thou groan'd for him as I haue done,
2479   Thou wouldest be more pittifull:
2480   But now I know thy minde; thou do'st suspect
2481   That I haue bene disloyall to thy bed,
2482   And that he is a Bastard, not thy Sonne:
2483   Sweet Yorke, sweet husband, be not of that minde:
2484   He is as like thee, as a man may bee,
2485   Not like to me, nor any of my Kin,
2486   And yet I loue him.
2487   <S {Yorke}.> Make way, vnruly Woman.  <D {Exit}>
2488   <S {Dut}.> After {Aumerle}. Mount thee vpon his horse,
2489   Spurre post, and get before him to the King,
2490   And begge thy pardon, ere he do accuse thee,
2491   Ile not be long behind: though I be old,
2492   I doubt not but to ride as fast as Yorke:
2493   And neuer will I rise vp from the ground,
2494  *Till {Bullingbrooke} haue pardon'd thee: Away be gone.  <D {Exit}>
2495   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
2496   <D {Enter Bullingbrooke, Percie, and other Lords}.>
2497   <S {Bul}.> Can no man tell of my vnthriftie Sonne?
2498   'Tis full three monthes since I did see him last.
2499   If any plague hang ouer vs, 'tis he,
2500   I would to heauen (my Lords) he might be found:
2501   Enquire at London, 'mongst the Tauernes there:
      <P d4>
2502   For there (they say) he dayly doth frequent,
2503   With vnrestrained loose Companions,
2504   Euen such (they say) as stand in narrow Lanes,
2505   And rob our Watch, and beate our passengers,
2506   Which he, yong wanton, and effeminate Boy
2507   Takes on the point of Honor, to support
2508   So dissolute a crew.
2509  *<S {Per}.> My Lord, some two dayes since I saw the Prince,
2510   And told him of these Triumphes held at Oxford.
2511   <S {Bul}.> And what said the Gallant?
2512   <S {Per}.> His answer was: he would vnto the Stewes,
2513   And from the common'st creature plucke a Gloue
2514   And weare it as a fauour, and with that
2515   He would vnhorse the lustiest Challenger.
2516   <S {Bul}.> As dissolute as desp'rate, yet through both,
2517   I see some sparkes of better hope: which elder dayes
2518   May happily bring forth. But who comes heere?
2519   <D {Enter Aumerle}.>
2520   <S {Aum}.> Where is the King?
2521   <S {Bul}.> What meanes our Cosin, that hee stares
2522   And lookes so wildely?
2523  *<S {Aum}.> God saue your Grace. I do beseech your Maiesty
2524   To haue some conference with your Grace alone.
2525   <S {Bul}.> Withdraw your selues, and leaue vs here alone:
2526   What is the matter with our Cosin now?
2527   <S {Aum}.> For euer may my knees grow to the earth,
2528   My tongue cleaue to my roofe within my mouth,
2529   Vnlesse a Pardon, ere I rise, or speake.
2530   <S {Bul}.> Intended, or committed was this fault?
2531   If on the first, how heynous ere it bee,
2532   To win thy after loue, I pardon thee.
2533   <S {Aum}.> Then giue me leaue, that I may turne the key,
2534   That no man enter, till my tale be done.
2535   <S {Bul}.> Haue thy desire.  <D {Yorke within}.>
2536   <S {Yor}.> My Liege beware, looke to thy selfe,
2537   Thou hast a Traitor in thy presence there.
2538   <S {Bul}.> Villaine, Ile make thee safe.
2539   <S {Aum}.> Stay thy reuengefull hand, thou hast no cause
2540   to feare.
2541   <S {Yorke}.> Open the doore, secure foole- hardy King:
2542   Shall I for loue speake treason to thy face?
2543   Open the doore, or I will breake it open.
2544   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
2545  *<S {Bul}.> What is the matter (Vnkle) speak, recouer breath,
2546   Tell vs how neere is danger,
2547   That we may arme vs to encounter it.
2548   <S {Yor}.> Peruse this writing heere, and thou shalt know
2549   The reason that my haste forbids me show.
2550   <S {Aum}.> Remember as thou read'st, thy promise past:
2551   I do repent me, reade not my name there,
2552   My heart is not confederate with my hand.
2553   <S {Yor}.> It was (villaine) ere thy hand did set it downe.
2554   I tore it from the Traitors bosome, King.
2555   Feare, and not Loue, begets his penitence;
2556   Forget to pitty him, least thy pitty proue
2557   A Serpent, that will sting thee to the heart.
2558   <S {Bul}.> Oh heinous, strong, and bold Conspiracie,
2559   O loyall Father of a treacherous Sonne:
2560   Thou sheere, immaculate, and siluer fountaine,
2561   From whence this streame, through muddy passages
2562   Hath had his current, and defil'd himselfe.
2563   Thy ouerflow of good, conuerts to bad,
2564   And thy abundant goodnesse shall excuse
2565   This deadly blot, in thy digressing sonne.
2566   <S {Yorke}.> So shall my Vertue be his Vices bawd,
2567   And he shall spend mine Honour, with his Shame;
2568   As thriftlesse Sonnes, their scraping Fathers Gold.
2569   Mine honor liues, when his dishonor dies,
2570   Or my sham'd life, in his dishonor lies:
2571   Thou kill'st me in his life, giuing him breath,
2572   The Traitor liues, the true man's put to death.
2573   <D {Dutchesse within}.>
2574  *<S {Dut}.> What hoa (my Liege) for heauens sake let me in.
2575  *<S {Bul}.> What shrill- voic'd Suppliant, makes this eager cry?
2576   <S {Dut}.> A woman, and thine Aunt (great King) 'tis I.
2577   Speake with me, pitty me, open the dore,
2578   A Begger begs, that neuer begg'd before.
2579   <S {Bul}.> Our Scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
2580   And now chang'd to the Begger, and the King.
2581   My dangerous Cosin, let your Mother in,
2582   I know she's come, to pray for your foule sin.
2583   <S {Yorke}.> If thou do pardon, whosoeuer pray,
2584   More sinnes for this forgiuenesse, prosper may.
2585   This fester'd ioynt cut off, the rest rests sound,
2586   This let alone, will all the rest confound.
2587   <D {Enter Dutchesse}.>
2588   <S {Dut}.> O King, beleeue not this hard- hearted man,
2589   Loue, louing not it selfe, none other can.
2590  *<S {Yor}.> Thou franticke woman, what dost y make here,
2591   Shall thy old dugges, once more a Traitor reare?
2592  *<S {Dut}.> Sweet Yorke be patient, heare me gentle Liege.
2593   <S {Bul}.> Rise vp good Aunt.
2594   <S {Dut}.> Not yet, I thee beseech.
2595   For euer will I kneele vpon my knees,
2596   And neuer see day, that the happy sees,
2597   Till thou giue ioy: vntill thou bid me ioy,
2598   By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing Boy.
2599   <S {Aum}.> Vnto my mothers prayres, I bend my knee.
2600  *<S {Yorke}.> Against them both, my true ioynts bended be.
2601   <S {Dut}.> Pleades he in earnest? Looke vpon his Face,
2602   His eyes do drop no teares: his prayres are in iest:
2603   His words come from his mouth, ours from our brest.
2604   He prayes but faintly, and would be denide,
2605   We pray with heart, and soule, and all beside:
2606   His weary ioynts would gladly rise, I know,
2607   Our knees shall kneele, till to the ground they grow:
2608   His prayers are full of false hypocrisie,
2609   Ours of true zeale, and deepe integritie:
2610   Our prayers do out- pray his, then let them haue
2611   That mercy, which true prayers ought to haue.
2612   <S {Bul}.> Good Aunt stand vp.
2613   <S {Dut}.> Nay, do not say stand vp.
2614   But Pardon first, and afterwards stand vp.
2615   #And if I were thy Nurse, thy tongue to teach,
2616   Pardon should be the first word of thy speach.
2617   I neuer long'd to heare a word till now:
2618   Say Pardon (King,) let pitty teach thee how.
2619   The word is short: but not so short as sweet,
2620   No word like Pardon, for Kings mouth's so meet.
2621   <S {Yorke}.> Speake it in French (King) say {Pardon'ne moy}.
2622   <S {Dut}.> Dost thou teach pardon, Pardon to destroy?
2623   Ah my sowre husband, my hard- hearted Lord,
2624   That set's the word it selfe, against the word.
2625   Speake Pardon, as 'tis currant in our Land,
2626   The chopping French we do not vnderstand.
2627   Thine eye begins to speake, set thy tongue there,
2628   Or in thy pitteous heart, plant thou thine eare,
2629   That hearing how our plaints and prayres do pearce,
2630   Pitty may moue thee, Pardon to rehearse.
2631   <S {Bul}.> Good Aunt, stand vp.
2632   <S {Dut}.> I do not sue to stand,
2633   Pardon is all the suite I haue in hand.
      <P d4v>
2634   <S {Bul}.> I pardon him, as heauen shall pardon mee.
2635   <S {Dut}.> O happy vantage of a kneeling knee?
2636   Yet am I sicke for feare: Speake it againe,
2637   Twice saying Pardon, doth not pardon twaine,
2638   But makes one pardon strong.
2639   <S {Bul}.> I pardon him with all my hart.
2640   <S {Dut}.> A God on earth thou art.
2641   <S {Bul}.> But for our trusty brother- in- Law, the Abbot,
2642   With all the rest of that consorted crew,
2643   Destruction straight shall dogge them at the heeles:
2644   Good Vnckle helpe to order seuerall powres
2645   To Oxford, or where ere these Traitors are:
2646   They shall not liue within this world I sweare,
2647   But I will haue them, if I once know where.
2648   Vnckle farewell, and Cosin adieu:
2649   Your mother well hath praid, and proue you true.
2650   <S {Dut}.> Come my old son, I pray heauen make thee new.
2651   <D {Exeunt}.>
2652   <D {Enter Exton and Seruants}.>
2653  *<S {Ext}.> Didst thou not marke the King what words hee
2654   spake?
2655   Haue I no friend will rid me of this liuing feare:
2656   Was it not so?
2657   <S {Ser}.> Those were his very words.
2658   <D {Ex}.> Haue I no Friend? (quoth he:) he spake it twice,
2659   And vrg'd it twice together, did he not?
2660   <S {Ser}.> He did.
2661   <D {Ex}.> And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
2662   As who should say, I would thou wer't the man
2663   That would diuorce this terror from my heart,
2664   Meaning the King at Pomfret: Come, let's goe;
2665   I am the Kings Friend, and will rid his Foe.  <D {Exit}.>
2666   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>
2667   <D {Enter Richard}.>
2668   <S {Rich}.> I haue bin studying, how to compare
2669   This Prison where I liue, vnto the World:
2670   And for because the world is populous,
2671   And heere is not a Creature, but my selfe,
2672   I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer't out.
2673   My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule,
2674   My Soule, the Father: and these two beget
2675   A generation of still breeding Thoughts;
2676   And these same Thoughts, people this Little World
2677   In humors, like the people of this world,
2678   For no thought is contented. The better sort,
2679   As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt
2680   With scruples, and do set the Faith it selfe
2681  *Against the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: & then again,
2682   It is as hard to come, as for a Camell
2683   To thred the posterne of a Needles eye.
2684   Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot
2685   Vnlikely wonders; how these vaine weake nailes
2686   May teare a passage through the Flinty ribbes
2687   Of this hard world, my ragged prison walles:
2688   And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride.
2689   Thoughts tending to Content, flatter themselues,
2690   That they are not the first of Fortunes slaues,
2691   Nor shall not be the last. Like silly Beggars,
2692   Who sitting in the Stockes, refuge their shame
2693   That many haue, and others must sit there;
2694   And in this Thought, they finde a kind of ease,
2695   Bearing their owne misfortune on the backe
2696   Of such as haue before indur'd the like.
2697   Thus play I in one Prison, many people,
2698   And none contented. Sometimes am I King;
2699   Then Treason makes me wish my selfe a Beggar,
2700   And so I am. Then crushing penurie,
2701   Perswades me, I was better when a King:
2702   Then am I king'd againe: and #by and by,
2703   Thinke that I am vn- king'd by {Bullingbrooke},
2704   And straight am nothing. But what ere I am,  <D {Musick}>
2705   Nor I, nor any man, that but man is,
2706   With nothing shall be pleas'd, till he be eas'd
2707   With being nothing. Musicke do I heare?
2708   Ha, ha? keepe time: How sowre sweet Musicke is,
2709   When Time is broke, and no Proportion kept?
2710   So is it in the Musicke of mens liues:
2711   And heere haue I the daintinesse of eare,
2712   To heare time broke in a disorder'd string:
2713   But for the Concord of my State and Time,
2714   Had not an eare to heare my true Time broke.
2715   I wasted Time, and now doth Time waste me:
2716   For now hath Time made me his numbring clocke;
2717   My Thoughts, are minutes; and with Sighes they iarre,
2718   Their watches on vnto mine eyes, the outward Watch,
2719   Whereto my finger, like a Dialls point,
2720   Is pointing still, in cleansing them from teares.
2721   Now sir, the sound that tels what houre it is,
2722   Are clamorous groanes, that strike vpon my heart,
2723   Which is the bell: so Sighes, and Teares, and Grones,
2724   Shew Minutes, Houres, and Times: but my Time
2725   Runs poasting on, in {Bullingbrookes} proud ioy,
2726   While I stand fooling heere, his iacke o'th' Clocke.
2727   This Musicke mads me, let it sound no more,
2728   For though it haue holpe madmen to their wits,
2729   In me it seemes, it will make wise- men mad:
2730   Yet blessing on his heart that giues it me;
2731   For 'tis a signe of loue, and loue to {Richard},
2732   Is a strange Brooch, in this all- hating world.
2733   <D {Enter Groome}.>
2734   <S {Groo}.> Haile Royall Prince.
2735   <S {Rich}.> Thankes Noble Peere,
2736   The cheapest of vs, is ten groates too deere.
2737   What art thou? And how com'st thou hither?
2738   Where no man euer comes, but that sad dogge
2739   That brings me food, to make misfortune liue?
2740   <S {Groo}.> I was a poore Groome of thy Stable (King)
2741   When thou wer't King: who trauelling towards Yorke,
2742   With much adoo, at length haue gotten leaue
2743   To looke vpon my (sometimes Royall) masters face.
2744   O how it yern'd my heart, when I beheld
2745   In London streets, that Coronation day,
2746   When {Bullingbrooke} rode on Roane Barbary,
2747   That horse, that thou so often hast bestrid,
2748   That horse, that I so carefully haue drest.
2749   <S {Rich}.> Rode he on Barbary? Tell me gentle Friend,
2750   How went he vnder him?
2751   <S {Groo}.> So proudly,  as if he had disdain'd the ground.
2752  *<S {Rich}.> So proud, that {Bullingbrooke} was on his backe;
2753   That Iade hath eate bread from my Royall hand.
2754   This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
2755   Would he not stumble? Would he not fall downe
2756   (Since Pride must haue a fall) and breake the necke
2757   Of that proud man, that did vsurpe his backe?
2758   Forgiuenesse horse: Why do I raile on thee,
2759   Since thou created to be aw'd by man
2760   Was't borne to beare? I was not made a horse,
      <P d5>
2761   And yet I beare a burthen like an Asse,
2762   Spur- gall'd, and tyrd by iauncing {Bullingbrooke}.
2763   <D {Enter Keeper with a Dish}.>
2764   <S {Keep}.> Fellow, giue place, heere is no longer stay.
2765   <S {Rich}.> If thou loue me, 'tis time thou wer't away.
2766  *<S {Groo}.> What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall
2767   say.  <D {Exit}.>
2768   <S {Keep}.> My Lord, #wilt please you to fall #too?
2769   <S {Rich}.> Taste of it first, as thou wer't wont to doo.
2770   <S {Keep}.> My Lord I dare not: Sir {Pierce} of Exton,
2771  *Who lately came from th' King, commands the contrary.
2772   <S {Rich}.> The diuell take {Henrie} of Lancaster, and thee;
2773   Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
2774   <S {Keep}.> Helpe, helpe, helpe.
2775   <D {Enter Exton and Seruants}.>
2776  *<S {Ri}.> How now? what meanes Death in this rude assalt?
2777  *Villaine, thine owne hand yeelds thy deaths instrument,
2778   Go thou and fill another roome in #hell.
2779   <D {Exton strikes him downe}.>
2780   That hand shall burne in neuer- quenching fire,
2781   That staggers thus my person. {Exton}, thy fierce hand,
2782  *Hath with the Kings blood, stain'd the Kings own land.
2783   Mount, mount my soule, thy seate is vp on high,
2784   Whil'st my grosse flesh sinkes downward, heere to dye.
2785   <S {Exton}.> As full of Valor, as of Royall blood,
2786   Both haue I spilt: Oh would the deed were good.
2787   For now the diuell, that told me I did well,
2788   Sayes, that this deede is chronicled in #hell.
2789   This dead King to the liuing King Ile beare,
2790   Take hence the rest, and giue them buriall heere.  <D {Exit}.>
2791   <Z {Scoena Quinta}.>
2792   <D {Flourish. Enter Bullingbrooke, Yorke, with}
2793   {other Lords & attendants}.>
2794   <S {Bul}.> Kinde Vnkle Yorke, the latest newes we heare,
2795   Is that the Rebels haue consum'd with fire
2796   Our Towne of Cicester in Gloucestershire,
2797   But whether they be tane or slaine, we heare not.
2798   <D {Enter Northumberland}.>
2799   Welcome my Lord: What is the newes?
2800  *<S {Nor}.> First to thy Sacred State, wish I all happinesse:
2801   The next newes is, I haue to London sent
2802   The heads of {Salsbury, Spencer, Blunt}, and {Kent}:
2803   The manner of their taking may appeare
2804   At large discoursed in this paper heere.
2805   <S {Bul}.> We thank thee gentle {Percy} for thy paines,
2806   And to thy worth will adde right worthy gaines.
2807   <D {Enter Fitz-waters}.>
2808  *<S {Fitz}.> My Lord, I haue from Oxford sent to London,
2809   The heads of {Broccas}, and Sir {Bennet Seely},
2810   Two of the dangerous consorted Traitors,
2811   That sought at Oxford, thy dire ouerthrow.
2812   <S {Bul}.> Thy paines {Fitzwaters} shall not be forgot,
2813   Right Noble is thy merit, well I wot.
2814   <D {Enter Percy and Carlile}.>
2815   <S {Per}.> The grand Conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
2816   With clog of Conscience, and sowre Melancholly,
2817   Hath yeelded vp his body to the graue:
2818   But heere is {Carlile}, liuing to abide
2819   Thy Kingly doome, and sentence of his pride.
2820   <S {Bul}.> {Carlile}, this is your doome:
2821   Choose out some secret place, some reuerend roome
2822   More then thou hast, and with it ioy thy life:
2823   So as thou liu'st in peace, dye free from strife:
2824   For though mine enemy, thou hast euer beene,
2825   High sparkes of Honor in thee haue I seene.
2826   <D {Enter Exton with a Coffin}.>
2827   <S {Exton}.> Great King, within this Coffin I present
2828   Thy buried feare. Heerein all breathlesse lies
2829   The mightiest of thy greatest enemies
2830   {Richard} of Burdeaux, by me hither brought.
2831  *<S {Bul}.> {Exton}, I thanke thee not, for thou hast wrought
2832   A deede of Slaughter, with thy fatall hand,
2833   Vpon my head, and all this famous Land.
2834   <D {Ex}.> From your owne mouth my Lord, did I this deed.
2835   <S {Bul}.> They loue not poyson, that do poyson neede,
2836   Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
2837   I hate the Murtherer, loue him murthered.
2838   The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
2839   But neither my good word, nor Princely fauour.
2840   With {Caine} go wander through the shade of night,
2841   And neuer shew thy head by day, nor light.
2842   Lords, I protest my soule is full of woe,
2843   That blood should sprinkle me, to make me grow.
2844   Come mourne with me, for that I do lament,
2845   And put on sullen Blacke incontinent:
2846   Ile make a voyage to the Holy- land,
2847   To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
2848   March sadly after, grace my mourning heere,
2849   In weeping after this vntimely Beere.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2850   <Z FINIS.
2851   The life and death of King Richard
2852   the Second.>
