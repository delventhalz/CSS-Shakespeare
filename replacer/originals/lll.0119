2     *<D {Enter Ferdinand King of Nauarre, Berowne, Longauill, and}
3      {Dumane}.>
4      <S {Ferdinand}.>
5      Let {Fame}, that all hunt after in their liues,
6      Liue registred vpon our brazen Tombes,
7      And then grace vs in the disgrace of death:
8      when spight of cormorant deuouring Time,
9      Th' endeuour of this present breath may buy:
10     That honour which shall bate his sythes keene edge,
11     And make vs heyres of all eternitie.
12     Therefore braue Conquerours, for so you are,
13     That warre against your owne affections,
14     And the huge Armie of the worlds desires.
15     Our late edict shall strongly stand in force,
16     {#Nauar} shall be the wonder of the world.
17     Our Court shall be a little Achademe,
18     Still and contemplatiue in liuing #Art.
19     You three, {Berowne, Dumaine}, and {Longauill},
20     Haue sworne for three yeeres terme, to liue with me:
21     My fellow Schollers, and to keepe those statutes
22     That are recorded in this scedule heere.
23     Your oathes are past, and now subscribe your names:
24     That his owne hand may strike his honour downe,
25     That violates the smallest branch heerein:
26     If you are arm'd to doe, as sworne to do,
27     Subscribe to your deepe oathes, and keepe it #to.
28     <S {Longauill}.> I am resolu'd, 'tis but a three yeeres fast:
29     The minde shall banquet, though the body pine,
30     Fat paunches haue leane pates: and dainty bits,
31     Make rich the ribs, but bankerout the wits.
32     <S {Dumane}.> My louing Lord, {Dumane} is mortified,
33     The grosser manner of these worlds delights,
34     He throwes vpon the grosse worlds baser slaues:
35     To loue, to wealth, to pompe, I pine and die,
36     With all these liuing in Philosophie.
37     <S {Berowne}.> I can but say their protestation ouer,
38     So much, deare Liege, I haue already sworne,
39     That is, to liue and study heere three yeeres.
40     But there are other strict obseruances:
41     As not to see a woman in that terme,
42     Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
43     And one day in a weeke to touch no foode:
44     And but one meale on euery day beside:
45     The which I hope is not enrolled there.
46     And then to sleepe but three houres in the night,
47     And not be seene to winke of all the day.
48     When I was wont to thinke no harme all night,
49     And make a darke night too of halfe the day:
50     Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
51     O, these are barren taskes, too hard to keepe,
52     Not to see Ladies, study, fast, not sleepe.
53     <S {Ferd}.> Your oath is past, to passe away from these.
54     <S {Berow}.> Let me say no my Liedge, #and if you please,
55     I onely swore to study with your grace,
56     And stay heere in your Court for three yeeres space.
57     <S {Longa}.> You swore to that {Berowne}, and to the rest.
58     <S {Berow}.> By yea and nay sir, than I swore in iest.
59     What is the end of study, let me know?
60    *<S {Fer}.> Why that to know which else wee should not
61     know.
62    *<S {Ber}.> Things hid & bard (you meane) fro[m] co[m]mon sense.
63     <S {Ferd}.> #I, that is studies god- like recompence.
64     <S {Bero}.> Come on then, I will sweare to studie so,
65     To know the thing I am forbid to know:
66     As thus, to study where I well may dine,
67     When I to fast expressely am forbid.
68     Or studie where to meete some Mistresse fine,
69     When Mistresses from common sense are hid.
70     Or hauing sworne too hard a keeping oath,
71     Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.
72     If studies gaine be thus, and this be so,
73     Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,
74     Sweare me to this, and I will nere say no.
75     <S {Ferd}.> These be the stops that hinder studie quite,
76     And traine our intellects to vaine delight.
77    *<S {Ber}.> Why? all delights are vaine, and that most vaine
78     Which with paine purchas'd, doth inherit paine,
79     As painefully to poare vpon a Booke,
80     To seeke the light of truth, while truth the while
81     Doth falsely blinde the eye- sight of his looke:
82     Light seeking light, doth light of light beguile:
83     So ere you finde where light in darkenesse lies,
84     Your light growes darke by losing of your eyes.
85     Studie me how to please the eye indeede,
86     By fixing it vpon a fairer eye,
87     Who dazling so, that eye shall be his heed,
88     And giue him light that it was blinded by.
89     Studie is like the heauens glorious Sunne,
90     That will not be deepe search'd with sawcy lookes:
91     Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,
92     Saue base authoritie from others Bookes.
93     These earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,
94     That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,
95     Haue no more profit of their shining nights,
96     Then those that walke and wot not what they are.
97     Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:
98     And euery Godfather can giue a name.
99     <S {Fer}.> How well hee's read, to reason against reading.
      <P L2><C D>
100   *<S {Dum}.> Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.
101   *<S {Lon}.> Hee weedes the corne, and still lets grow the
102    weeding.
103   *<S {Ber}.> The Spring is neare when greene geesse are #a
104    breeding.
105    <S {Dum}.> How followes that?
106    <S {Ber}.> Fit in his place and time.
107    <S {Dum}.> In reason nothing.
108    <S {Ber}.> Something then in rime.
109    <S {Ferd}.> {Berowne} is like an enuious sneaping Frost,
110    That bites the first borne infants of the Spring.
111   *<S {Ber}.> Wel, say I am, why should proud Summer boast,
112    Before the Birds haue any cause to sing?
113    Why should I ioy in any abortiue birth?
114    At Christmas I no more desire a Rose,
115    Then wish a Snow in Mayes new fangled showes:
116    But like of each thing that in season growes.
117    So you to studie now it is too late,
118    That were to clymbe ore the house to vnlocke the gate.
119    <S {Fer}.> Well, sit you out: go home {Berowne}: adue.
120   *<S {Ber}.> No my good Lord, I haue sworn to stay with you.
121    And though I haue for barbarisme spoke more,
122    Then for that Angell knowledge you can say,
123    Yet confident Ile keepe what I haue sworne,
124    And bide the pennance of each three yeares day.
125    Giue me the paper, let me reade the same,
126    And to the strictest decrees Ile write my name.
127   *<S {Fer}.> How well this yeelding rescues thee from shame.
128   *<S {Ber}.> {Item}. That no woman shall come within a mile
129    of my Court.
130    Hath this bin proclaimed?
131    <S {Lon}.> Foure dayes agoe.
132    <S {Ber}.> Let's see the penaltie.
133    On paine of loosing her tongue.
134    Who deuis'd this penaltie?
135    <S {Lon}.> Marry that did I.
136    <S {Ber}.> Sweete Lord, and why?
137   *<S {Lon}.> To fright them hence with that dread penaltie,
138    A dangerous law against gentilitie.
139   *{Item,} If any man be seene to talke with a woman with-in
140   *the tearme of three yeares, hee shall indure such
141   *publique shame as the rest of the Court shall possibly
142    deuise.
143   *<S {Ber}.> This Article my Liedge your selfe must breake,
144    For well you know here comes in Embassie
145    The {French} Kings daughter, with your selfe to speake:
146    A Maide of grace and compleate maiestie,
147    About surrender vp of {Aquitaine}:
148    To her decrepit, sicke, and bed- rid Father.
149    Therefore this Article is made in vaine,
150    Or vainly comes th' admired Princesse hither.
151    <S {Fer}.> What say you Lords?
152    Why, this was quite forgot.
153    <S {Ber}.> So Studie euermore is ouershot,
154    While it doth study to haue what it would,
155    It doth forget to doe the thing it should:
156    And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
157    'Tis won as townes with fire, so won, so lost.
158    <S {Fer}.> We must of force dispence with this Decree,
159    She must lye here on meere necessitie.
160    <S {Ber}.> Necessity will make vs all forsworne
161    Three thousand times within this three yeeres space:
162    For euery man with his affects is borne,
163    Not by #might mastred, but by speciall grace.
164    If I breake faith, this word shall breake for me,
165    I am forsworne on meere necessitie.
166    So to the Lawes at large I write my name,
167    And he that breakes them in the least degree,
168    Stands in attainder of eternall shame.
169    Suggestions are to others as to me:
170    But I beleeue although I seeme so loth,
171    I am the last that will last keepe his oth.
172    But is there no quicke recreation granted?
173    <S {Fer}.> #I that there is, our Court you know is hanted
174    With a refined trauailer of {Spaine},
175    A man in all the worlds new fashion planted,
176    That hath a mint of phrases in his braine:
177    One, who the musicke of his owne vaine tongue,
178    Doth rauish like inchanting harmonie:
179    A man of complements whom right and wrong
180    Haue chose as vmpire of their mutinie.
181    This childe of fancie that {Armado} hight,
182    For interim to our studies shall relate,
183    In high- borne words the worth of many a Knight:
184    From tawnie {Spaine} lost in the worlds debate.
185    How you delight my Lords, I know not I,
186    But I protest I loue to heare him lie,
187    And I will vse him for my Minstrelsie.
188    <S {Bero}.> {Armado} is a most illustrious wight,
189    A man of fire, new words, fashions owne Knight.
190    <S {Lon}.> {Costard} the swaine and he, shall be our sport,
191    And so to studie, three yeeres is but short.
192    <D {Enter a Constable with Costard with a Letter}.>
193    <S {Const}.> Which is the Dukes owne person.
194    <S {Ber}.> This fellow, What would'st?
195   *<S {Con}.> I my selfe reprehend his owne person, for I am
196   *his graces Tharborough: But I would see his own person
197    in flesh and blood.
198    <S {Ber}.> This is he.
199    <S {Con}.> Signeor {Arme, Arme} commends you:
200    Ther's villanie abroad, this letter will tell you more.
201   *<S {Clow}.> Sir the Contempts thereof are as touching
202    mee.
203    <S {Fer}.> A letter from the magnificent {Armado}.
204   *<S {Ber}.> How low soeuer the matter, I hope in God for
205    high words.
206   *<S {Lon}.> A high hope for a low heauen, God grant vs pa-tience.
207   _
208    <S {Ber}.> To heare, or forbeare hearing.
209   *<S {Lon}.> To heare meekely sir, and to laugh moderately,
210    or to forbeare both.
211   *<S {Ber}.> Well sir, be it as the stile shall giue vs cause to
212    clime in the merrinesse.
213   *<S {Clo}.> The matter is to me sir, as concerning {Iaquenetta}.
214    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
215    <S {Ber}.> In what manner?
216   *<S {Clo}.> In manner and forme following sir all those three.
217   *I was seene with her in the Mannor house, sitting with
218   *her vpon the Forme, and taken following her into the
219   *Parke: which put to gether, is in manner and forme
220   *following. Now sir for the manner; It is the manner
221   *of a man to speake to a woman, for the forme in some
222    forme.
223    <S {Ber}.> For the following sir.
224   *<S {Clo}.> As it shall follow in my correction, and God de-fend
225    the right.
226    <S {Fer}.> Will you heare this Letter with attention?
227    <S {Ber}.> As we would heare an Oracle.
228   *<S {Clo}.> Such is the simplicitie of man to harken after the
229    flesh.
      <P L2v><C C>
230    <S {Ferdinand}.>
231   *{Great Deputie, the Welkins Vicegerent, and sole domi-nator}
232   *{of} Nauar, {my soules earths God, and bodies fo-string}
233    {patrone}:
234    <S {Cost}.> Not a word of {Costard} yet.
235    <S {Ferd}.> {So it is}.
236   *<S {Cost}.> It   may be so: but if he say it is so, he is in telling
237    true: but so.
238    <S {Ferd}.> Peace,
239    <S {Clow}.> Be to me, and euery man that dares not fight.
240    <S {Ferd}.> No words,
241    <S {Clow}.> Of other mens secrets I beseech you.
242   *<S {Ferd}.> {So it is besieged with sable coloured melancholie, I}
243   *{did commend the blacke oppressing humour to the most whole-some}
244   *{Physicke of thy health- giuing ayre: And as I am a Gen-tleman},

247   *{sit downe to that nourishment which is called supper: So much}
248   *{for the time #When. Now for the ground #Which? which I}
249   *{meane I walkt vpon, it is ycliped, Thy Parke. Then for the}
250   *{place #Where? where I meane I did encounter that obscene and}
251   *{most preposterous euent that draweth from my snow- white pen}
252   *{the ebon coloured Inke, which heere thou viewest, beholdest:}
253   *{suruayest, or seest. But to the place #Where? It standeth}

264   *{or for thy more sweet understanding   a woman: him, I (as my}

274    #Don Adriana de Armado.
275   *<S {Ber}.> This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
276    that euer I heard.
277   *<S {Fer}.> #I the best, for the worst. But sirra, What say you
278    to this?
279    <S {Clo}.> Sir I confesse the Wench.
280    <S {Fer}.> Did you heare the Proclamation?
281   *<S {Clo}.> I doe confesse much of the hearing it, but little
282    of the marking of it.
283   *<S {Fer}.> It was proclaimed a yeeres imprisonment to bee
284    taken with a Wench.
285   *<S {Clow}.> I was taken with none sir, I was taken with a
286    Damosell.
287    <S {Fer}.> Well, it was proclaimed Damosell.
288   *<S {Clo}.> This was no Damosell neyther sir, shee was a
289    Virgin.
290   *<S {Fer}.> It is so varried #to, for it was proclaimed Virgin.
291   *<S {Clo}.> If it were, I denie her Virginitie: I was taken
292    with a Maide.
293    <S {Fer}.> This Maid will not serue your turne sir.
294    <S {Clo}.> This Maide will serue my turne sir.
295   *<S {Kin}.> Sir I will pronounce your sentence: You shall
296    fast a Weeke with Branne and water.
297   *<S {Clo}.> I had rather pray a Moneth with Mutton and
298    Porridge.
299    <S {Kin}.> And {#Don Armado} shall be your keeper.
300    My Lord {Berowne}, see him deliuer'd ore,
301    And goe we Lords to put in practice that,
302    Which each to other hath so strongly sworne.
303    <S {Bero}.> Ile lay my head to any good mans hat,
304    These oathes and lawes will proue an idle scorne.
305    Sirra, come on.
306   *<S {Clo}.> I suffer for the truth sir: for true it is, I was ta-ken
307   *with {Iaquenetta}, and {Iaquenetta} is a true girle, and
308   *therefore welcome the sowre cup of prosperitie, afflicti-on
309   *may one day smile againe, and vntill then sit downe
310    sorrow.  <D {Exit}.>
311    <D {Enter Armado and Moth his Page}.>
312   *<S {Arma}.> Boy, What signe is it when a man of great
313    spirit growes melancholy?
314    <S {Boy}.> A great signe sir, that he will looke sad.
315   *<S {Brag}.> Why? sadnesse is one and the selfe- same thing
316    deare impe.
317    <S {Boy}.> No no, O Lord sir no.
318   *<S {Brag}.> How canst thou part sadnesse and melancholy
319    my tender {Iuuenall}?
320   *<S {Boy}.> By a familiar demonstration of the working, my
321    tough signeur.
322    <S {Brag}.> Why tough signeur? Why tough signeur?
323    <S {Boy}.> Why tender {Iuuenall}? Why tender {Iuuenall}?
324   *<S {Brag}.> I spoke it tender {Iuuenall}, as a congruent apa-thaton,
325   *appertaining to thy young daies, which we may
326    nominate tender.
327   *<S {Boy}.> And I tough signeur, as an appertinent title to
328    your olde time, which we may name tough.
329    <S {Brag}.> Pretty and apt.
330   *<S {Boy}.> How meane you sir, I pretty, and my saying apt?
331    or I apt, and my saying prettie?
332    <S {Brag}.> Thou pretty because little.
333    <S {Boy}.> Little pretty, because little: wherefore apt?
334    <S {Brag}.> And therefore apt, because quicke.
335    <S {Boy}.> Speake you this in my praise Master?
336    <S {Brag}.> In thy condigne praise.
337    <S {Boy}.> I will praise an Eele with the same praise.
338    <S {Brag}.> What? that an Eele is ingenuous.
339    <S {Boy}.> That an Eele is quicke.
340   *<S {Brag}.> I doe say thou art quicke in answeres. Thou
341    heat'st my bloud.
342    <S {Boy}.> I am answer'd sir.
343    <S {Brag}.> I loue not to be crost.
344   *<S {Boy}.> He speakes the meere contrary, crosses loue not |(him.
345   *<S {Br}.> I haue promis'd to study iij. yeres with the Duke.
346    <S {Boy}.> You may doe it in an houre sir.
347    <S {Brag}.> Impossible.
348    <S {Boy}.> How many is one thrice told?
349   *<S {Bra}.> I am #ill at reckning, it fits the spirit of a Tapster.
350    <S {Boy}.> You are a gentleman and a gamester sir.
351   *<S {Brag}.> I confesse both, they are both the varnish of a
352    compleat man.
353   *<S {Boy}.> Then I am sure you know how much the grosse
354    summe of deus- ace amounts to.
355    <S {Brag}.> It doth amount to one more then two.
356    <S {Boy}.> Which the base vulgar call three.
357   *<S {Br}.> True. <S {Boy}.> Why sir is this such a peece of study?
358   *Now here's three studied, ere you'll thrice wink, & how
359   *easie it is to put yeres to the word three, and study three
360    yeeres in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.
      <P L3>
361    <S {Brag}.> A most fine Figure.
362    <S {Boy}.> To proue you a Cypher.
363   *<S {Brag}.> I will heereupon confesse I am in loue: and as
364   *it is base for a Souldier to loue; so am I in loue with a
365   *base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
366   *of affection, would deliuer mee from the reprobate
367   *thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransome
368   *him to any French Courtier for a new deuis'd curtsie. I
369   *thinke scorne to sigh,  me thinkes I should out- sweare
370   *{Cupid}. Comfort me Boy, What great men haue beene
371    in loue?
372    <S {Boy}.> {Hercules} Master.
373   *<S {Brag}.> Most sweete {Hercules}: more authority deare
374   *Boy, name more; and sweet my childe let them be men
375    of good repute and carriage.
376   *<S {Boy}.> {Sampson} Master, he was a man of good carriage,
377   *great carriage: for hee carried the Towne- gates on his
378    backe like a Porter: and he was in loue.
379   *<S {Brag}.> O well- knit {Sampson}, strong ioynted {Sampson};
380   *I doe excell thee in my rapier, as much as thou didst mee
381   *in carrying gates. I am in loue too. Who was {Sampsons}
382    loue my deare {Moth}?
383    <S {Boy}.> A Woman, Master.
384    <S {Brag}.> Of what complexion?
385   *<S {Boy}.> Of all the foure, or the three, or the two, or one
386    of the foure.
387    <S {Brag}.> Tell me precisely of what complexion?
388    <S {Boy}.> Of the sea- water Greene sir.
389    <S {Brag}.> Is that one of the foure complexions?
390    <S {Boy}.> As I haue read sir, and the best of them too.
391   *<S {Brag}.> Greene indeed is the colour of Louers: but to
392   *haue a Loue of that colour, methinkes {Sampson} had small
393    reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
394    <S {Boy}.> It was so sir, for she had a greene wit.
395    <S {Brag}.> My Loue is most immaculate white and red.
396   *<S {Boy}.> Most immaculate thoughts Master, are mask'd
397    vnder such colours.
398    <S {Brag}.> Define, define, well educated infant.
399   *<S {Boy}.> My fathers witte, and my mothers tongue assist
400    mee.
401   *<S {Brag}.> Sweet inuocation of a childe, most pretty and
402    patheticall.
403    <S {Boy}.> If shee be made of white and red,
404    Her faults will nere be knowne:
405    For blush-in cheekes by faults are bred,
406    And feares by pale white showne:
407    Then if she feare, or be to blame,
408    By this you shall not know,
409    For still her cheekes possesse the same,
410    Which natiue she doth owe:
411   *A dangerous rime master against the reason of white
412    and redde.
413   *<S {Brag}.> Is there not a ballet Boy, of the King and the
414    Begger?
415   *<S {Boy}.> The world was very guilty of such a Ballet some
416   *three ages since, but I thinke now 'tis not to be found: or
417   *if it were, it would neither serue for the writing, nor the
418    tune.
419   *<S {Brag}.> I will haue that subiect newly writ ore, that I
420   *may example my digression by some mighty president.
421   *Boy, I doe loue that Countrey girle that I tooke in
422   *the Parke with the rationall hinde {Costard}: she deserues
423    well.
424   *<S {Boy}.> To bee whip'd: and yet a better loue then my
425    Master.
426    <S {Brag}.> Sing Boy, my spirit grows heauy in loue.
427    <S {Boy}.> And that's great maruell, louing a light wench.
428    <S {Brag}.> I say sing.
429    <S {Boy}.> Forbeare till this company be past.
430    <D {Enter Clowne, Constable, and Wench}.>
431   *<S {Const}.> Sir, the Dukes pleasure, is that you keepe {Co-stard}
432   *safe, and you must let him take no delight, nor no
433   *penance, but hee must fast three daies a weeke: for this
434   *Damsell, I must keepe her at the Parke, shee is alowd for
435    the Day- woman. Fare you well.  <D {Exit}.>
436    <S {Brag}.> I do betray my selfe with blushing: Maide.
437    <S {Maid}.> Man.
438    <S {Brag}.> I wil visit thee at the Lodge.
439    <S {Maid}.> That's here by.
440    <S {Brag}.> I know where it is situate.
441    <S {Mai}.> Lord how wise you are!
442    <S {Brag}.> I will tell thee wonders.
443    <S {Ma}.> With what face?
444    <S {Brag}.> I loue thee.
445    <S {Mai}.> So I heard you say.
446    <S {Brag}.> And so farewell.
447    <S {Mai}.> Faire weather after you.
448    <S {Clo}.> Come {Iaquenetta}, away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
449   *<S {Brag}.> Villaine, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere
450    thou be pardoned.
451   *<S {Clo}.> Well sir, I hope when I doe it, I shall doe it on a
452    full stomacke.
453    <S {Brag}.> Thou shalt be heauily punished.
454   *<S {Clo}.> I am more bound to you then your fellowes, for
455    they are but lightly rewarded.
456    <S {Clo}.> Take away this villaine, shut him vp.
457    <S {Boy}.> Come you transgressing slaue, away.
458   *<S {Clow}.> Let mee not bee pent vp sir, I will fast being
459    loose.
460   *<S {Boy}.> No sir, that were fast and loose: thou shalt to
461    prison.
462   *<S {Clow}.> Well, if euer I do see the merry dayes of deso-lation
463    that I haue seene, some shall see.
464    <S {Boy}.> What shall some see?
465   *<S {Clow}.> Nay nothing, Master {Moth}, but what they
466   *looke vpon. It is not for prisoners to be silent in their
467   *words, and therefore I will say nothing: I thanke God, I
468   *haue as little patience as another man, and therefore I
469    can be quiet.  <D {Exit}.>
470   *<S {Brag}.> I doe affect the very ground (which is base)
471   *where her shooe (which is baser) guided by her foote
472   *(which is basest) doth tread. I shall be forsworn (which
473   *is a great argument of falshood) if I loue. And how can
474   *that be true loue, which is falsly attempted? Loue is a fa-miliar,
475   *Loue is a Diuell. There is no euill Angell but
476   *Loue, yet {Sampson} was so tempted, and he had an excel-lent
477   *strength: Yet was {Salomon} so seduced, and hee had
478   *a very good witte. {Cupids} Butshaft is too hard for {Her-cules}
479   *Clubbe, and therefore too much ods for a Spa-niards
480   *Rapier: The first and second cause will not serue
481   *my turne: the {Passado} hee respects not, the {Duello} he
482   *regards not; his disgrace is to be called Boy, but his
483   *glorie is to subdue men. Adue Valour, rust Rapier, bee
484   *still Drum, for your manager is in loue; yea hee loueth.
485   *Assist me some extemporall god of Rime, for I am sure I
486   *shall turne Sonnet. Deuise Wit, write Pen, for I am for
487    whole volumes in folio.  <D {Exit}.>

490   *<D {Enter the Princesse of France, with three attending Ladies,}
491    {and three Lords}.>
492   *<S {Boyet}.> Now Madam summon vp your dearest spirits,
493    Consider who the King your father sends:
494    To whom he sends, and what's his Embassie.
495    Your selfe, held precious in the worlds esteeme,
496    To parlee with the sole inheritour
497    Of all perfections that a man may owe,
498    Matchlesse {Nauarre}, the plea of no lesse weight
499    Then {Aquitaine}, a Dowrie for a Queene,
500    Be now as prodigall of all deare grace,
501    As Nature was in making Graces deare,
502    When she did starue the generall world beside,
503    And prodigally gaue them all to you.
504   *<S {Queen}.> Good L[ord]. {Boyet}, my beauty though but mean,
505    Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
506    Beauty is bought by iudgement of the eye,
507    Not vttred by base sale of chapmens tongues:
508    I am lesse proud to heare you tell my worth,
509    Then you much willing to be counted wise,
510    In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
511    But now to taske the tasker, good {Boyet}.
512    <S {Prin}.> You are not ignorant all- telling fame
513    Doth noyse abroad {Nauar} hath made a vow,
514    Till painefull studie shall out- weare three yeares,
515    No woman may approach his silent Court:
516    Therefore to's seemeth it a needfull course,
517    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
518    To know his pleasure, and in that behalfe
519    Bold of your worthinesse, we single you,
520    As our best mouing faire soliciter:
521    Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
522    On serious businesse crauing quicke dispatch,
523    Importunes personall conference with his grace.
524    Haste, signifie so much while we attend,
525    Like humble visag'd suters his high #will.
526    <S {Boy}.> Proud of imployment, willingly I goe.  <D {Exit}.>
527    <S {Prin}.> All pride is willing pride, and yours is so:
528   *Who are the Votaries my Louing Lords, that are vow- fellowes
529    with this vertuous Duke?
530    <S {Lor}.> {Longauill} is one.
531    <S {Princ}.> Know you the man?
532    <S 1 {Lady}.> I know him Madame at a marriage feast,
533    Betweene L[ord]. {Perigort} and the beautious heire
534    Of {Iaques Fauconbridge} solemnized.
535    In {Normandie} saw I this {Longauill},
536    A man of soueraigne parts he is esteem'd:
537    Well fitted in Arts, glorious in Armes:
538    Nothing becomes him #ill that he would well.
539    The onely soyle of his faire vertues glosse,
540    If vertues glosse will staine with any soile,
541    Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a #Will:
542    Whose edge hath power to cut whose #will still wills,
543    It should none spare that come within his power.
544    <S {Prin}.> Some merry mocking Lord belike, ist so?
545   *<S {Lad}.1.> They say so most, that most his humors know.
546    <S {Prin}.> such short liu'd wits do wither as they grow.
547    Who are the rest?
548   *<S 2.{Lad}.> The yong {Dumaine}, a well accomplisht youth,
549    Of all that Vertue loue, for Vertue loued.
550    Most power to doe most harme, least knowing #ill:
551    For he hath wit to make an #ill shape good,
552    And shape to win grace though she had no wit.
553    I saw him at the Duke {Alansoes} once,
554    And much too little of that good I saw,
555    Is my report to his great worthinesse.
556    <S {Rossa}.> Another of these Students at that time,
557    Was there with him, as I haue heard a truth.
558    {#Berowne} they call him, but a merrier man,
559    Within the limit of becomming mirth,
560    I neuer spent an houres talke withall.
561    His eye begets occasion for his wit,
562    For euery obiect that the one doth catch,
563    The other turnes to a mirth- mouing iest.
564    Which his faire tongue (conceits expositor)
565    Deliuers in such apt and gracious words,
566    That aged eares play treuant at his tales,
567    And yonger hearings are quite rauished.
568    So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
569    <S {Prin}.> God blesse my Ladies, are they all in loue?
570    That euery one her owne hath garnished,
571    With such bedecking ornaments of praise.
572    <S {Ma}.> Heere comes {Boyet}.
573    <D {Enter Boyet}.>
574    <S {Prin}.> Now, what admittance Lord?
575    <S {Boyet}.> {Nauar} had notice of your faire approach;
576    And he and his competitors in oath,
577    Were all addrest to meete you gentle Lady
578    Before I came: Marrie thus much I haue learnt,
579    He rather meanes to lodge you in the field,
580    Like one that comes heere to besiege his Court,
581    Then seeke a dispensation for his oath:
582    To let you enter his vnpeopled house.
583    <D {Enter Nauar, Longauill, Dumaine, and Berowne}.>
584    Heere comes {Nauar}.
585   *<S {Nau}.> Faire Princesse, welcom to the Court of {Nauar}.
586   *<S {Prin}.> Faire I giue you backe againe, and welcome I
587   *haue not yet: the roofe of this Court is too high to bee
588   *yours, and welcome to the wide fields, too base to be
589    mine.
590    <S {Nau}.> You shall be welcome Madam to my Court.
591    <S {Prin}.> I wil be welcome then, Conduct me thither.
592    <S {Nau}.> Heare me deare Lady, I haue sworne an oath.
593    <S {Prin}.> Our Lady helpe my Lord, he'll be forsworne.
594    <S {Nau}.> Not for the world faire Madam, by my #will.
595   *<S {Prin}.> Why, #will shall breake it #will, and nothing els.
596    <S {Nau}.> Your Ladiship is ignorant what it is.
597    <S {Prin}.> Were my Lord so, his ignorance were wise,
598    Where now his knowledge must proue ignorance.
599    I heare your grace hath sworne out House- keeping:
600    'Tis deadly sinne to keepe that oath my Lord,
601    And sinne to breake it:
602    But pardon me, I am too sodaine bold,
603    To teach a Teacher #ill beseemeth me.
604    Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my comming,
605    And sodainly resolue me in my suite.
606    <S {Nau}.> Madam, I will, if sodainly I may.
607    <S {Prin}.> You will the sooner that I were away,
608    For you'll proue periur'd if you make me stay.
609    <S {Berow}.> Did not I dance with you in {Brabant} once?
610    <S {Rosa}.> Did not I dance with you in {Brabant} once?
      <P L4>
611    <S {Ber}.> I know you did.
612   *<S {Rosa}.> How needlesse was it then to ask the question?
613    <S {Ber}.> You must not be so quicke.
614   *<S {Rosa}.> 'Tis long of you y spur me with such questions.
615   *<S {Ber}.> Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
616    <S {Rosa}.> Not till it leaue the Rider in the mire.
617    <S {Ber}.> What time #a day?
618    <S {Rosa}.> The howre that fooles should aske.
619    <S {Ber}.> Now faire befall your maske.
620    <S {Rosa}.> Faire fall the face it couers.
621    <S {Ber}.> And send you many louers.
622    <S {Rosa}.> Amen, so you be none.
623    <S {Ber}.> Nay then will I be gone.
624    <S {Kin}.> Madame, your father heere doth intimate,
625    The paiment of a hundred thousand Crownes,
626    Being but th' one halfe, of an intire summe,
627    Disbursed by my father in his warres.
628    But say that he, or we, as neither haue
629    Receiu'd that summe; yet there remaines vnpaid
630    A hundred thousand more: in surety of the which,
631    One part of {Aquitaine} is bound to vs,
632    Although not valued to the moneys worth.
633    If then the King your father will restore
634    But that one halfe which is vnsatisfied,
635    We will giue vp our right in {Aquitaine},
636    And hold faire friendship with his Maiestie:
637    But that it seemes he little purposeth,
638    For here he doth demand to haue repaie,
639    An hundred thousand Crownes, and not demands
640    One paiment of a hundred thousand Crownes,
641    To haue his title liue in {Aquitaine}.
642    Which we much rather had depart withall,
643    And haue the money by our father lent,
644    Then {Aquitane}, so guelded as it is.
645    Deare Princesse, were not his requests so farre
646    From reasons yeelding, your faire selfe should make
647    A yeelding 'gainst some reason in my brest,
648    And goe well satisfied to {France} againe.
649   *<S {Prin}.> You doe the King my Father too much wrong,
650    And wrong the reputation of your name,
651    In so vnseeming to confesse receyt
652    Of that which hath so faithfully beene paid.
653    <S {Kin}.> I doe protest I neuer heard of it,
654    And if you proue it, Ile repay it backe,
655    Or yeeld vp {Aquitaine}.
656    <S {Prin}.> We arrest your word:
657    {#Boyet}, you can produce acquittances
658    For such a summe, from speciall Officers,
659    Of {Charles} his Father.
660    <S {Kin}.> Satisfie me so.
661    <S {Boyet}.> So please your Grace, the packet is not come
662    Where that and other specialties are bound,
663    To morrow you shall haue a sight of them.
664    <S {Kin}.> It shall suffice me; at which enterview,
665    All liberall reason would I yeeld vnto:
666    Meane time, receiue such welcome at my hand,
667    As honour, without breach of Honour may
668    Make tender of, to thy true worthinesse.
669    You may not come faire Princesse in my gates,
670    But heere without you shall be so receiu'd,
671    As you shall deeme your selfe lodg'd in my heart,
672    Though so deni'd farther harbour in my house:
673    Your owne good thoughts excuse me, and farewell,
674    To morrow we shall visit you againe.
675   *<S {Prin}.> Sweet health & faire desires consort your grace.
676   *<S {Kin}.> Thy own wish wish I thee, in euery place.  <D {Exit}.>
677    <S {Boy}.> Lady, I will commend you to my owne heart.
678    <S {La.Ro}.> Pray you doe my commendations,
679    I would be glad to see it.
680    <S {Boy}.> I would you heard it grone.
681    <S {La.Ro}.> Is the soule sicke?
682    <S {Boy}.> Sicke at the heart.
683    <S {La.Ro}.> Alacke, let it bloud.
684    <S {Boy}.> Would that doe it good?
685    <S {La.Ro}.> My Phisicke saies I.
686    <S {Boy}.> Will you prick't with your eye.
687    <S {La.Ro}.> {No poynt}, with my knife.
688    <S {Boy}.> Now God saue thy life.
689    <S {La.Ro}.> And yours from long liuing.
690    <S {Ber}.> I cannot stay thanks- giuing.  <D {Exit}.>
691    <D {Enter Dumane}.>
692   *<S {Dum}.> Sir, I pray you a word: What Lady is that same?
693    <S {Boy}.> The heire of {Alanson, Rosalin} her name.
694    <S {Dum}.> A gallant Lady, Mounsier fare you well.
695   *<S {Long}.> I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
696   *<S {Boy}.> A woman somtimes, if you saw her in the light.
697   *<S {Long}.> Perchance light in the light: I desire her name.
698    <S {Boy}.> Shee hath but one for her selfe,
699    To desire that were a shame.
700    <S {Long}.> Pray you sir, whose daughter?
701    <S {Boy}.> Her Mothers, I haue heard.
702    <S {Long}.> Gods blessing #a your beard.
703    <S {Boy}.> Good sir be not offended,
704    Shee is an heyre of {Faulconbridge}.
705    <S {Long}.> Nay, my choller is ended:
706    Shee is a most sweet Lady.  <D {Exit. Long}.>
707    <S {Boy}.> Not vnlike sir, that may be.
708    <D {Enter Beroune}.>
709    <S {Ber}.> What's her name in the cap.
710    <S {Boy}.> {Katherine} by good hap.
711    <S {Ber}.> Is she wedded, or no.
712    <S {Boy}.> To her #will sir, or so,
713    <S {Ber}.> You are welcome sir, adiew.
714    <S {Boy}.> Fare well to me sir, and welcome to you.  <D {Exit}.>
715   *<S {La.Ma}.> That last is {Beroune}, the mery mad- cap Lord.
716    Not a word with him, but a iest.
717    <S {Boy}.> And euery iest but a word.
718   *<S {Pri}.> It was well done of you to take him at his word.
719   *<S {Boy}.> I was as willing to grapple, as he was to boord.
720    <S {La.Ma}.> Two hot Sheepes marie:
721    And wherefore not Ships?
722   *<S {Boy}.> No Sheepe (sweet Lamb) vnlesse we feed on your |(lips.
723   *<S {La}.> You Sheepe & I pasture: shall that finish the iest?
724    <S {Boy}.> So you grant pasture for me.
725    <S {La}.> Not so gentle beast.
726    My lips are no Common, though seuerall they be.
727    <S {Bo}.> Belonging to whom?
728    <S {La}.> To my fortunes and me.
729   *<S {Prin}.> Good wits wil be iangling, but gentles agree.
730    This ciuill warre of wits were much better vsed
731    On {Nauar} and his bookemen, for heere 'tis abus'd.
732    <S {Bo}.> If my obseruation (which very seldome lies
733    By the hearts still rhetoricke, disclosed with eyes)
734    Deceiue me not now, {Nauar} is infected.
735    <S {Prin}.> With what?
736    <S {Bo}.> With that which we Louers intitle affected.
737    <S {Prin}.> Your reason.
738    <S {Bo}.> Why all his behauiours doe make their retire,
739    To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.
740    His hart like an Agot with your print impressed,
      <P L4v><C D>
741    Proud with his forme, in his eie pride expressed.
742    His tongue all impatient to speake and not see,
743    Did stumble with haste in his eie- sight to be,
744    All sences to that sence did make their repaire,
745    To feele onely looking on fairest of faire:
746    Me thought all his sences were lockt in his eye,
747    As Iewels in Christall for some Prince to Buy.
748   *Who tendring their own worth from whence they were |(glast,
749    Did point out to buy them along as you past.
750    His faces owne margent did coate such amazes,
751    That all eyes saw his eies inchanted with gazes.
752    Ile giue you {Aquitaine}, and all that is his,
753    #And you giue him for my sake, but one louing Kisse.
754    <S {Prin}.> Come to our Pauillion, {Boyet} is disposde.
755   *<S {Bro}.> But to speak that in words, which his eie hath dis-|(clos'd.
756    I onelie haue made a mouth of his eie,
757    By adding a tongue, which I know will not lie.
758   *<S {Lad.Ro}.> Thou art an old Loue- monger, and speakest
759    skilfully.
760   *<S {Lad.Ma}.> He is {Cupids} Grandfather, and learnes news
761    of him.
762   *<S {Lad}.2.> Then was {Venus} like her mother, for her fa-ther
763    is but grim.
764    <S {Boy}.> Do you heare my mad wenches?
765    <S {La}.1.> No.
766    <S {Boy}.> What then, do you see?
767    <S {Lad}.2.> #I, our way to be gone.
768    <S {Boy}.> You are too hard for me.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>

773   _
774    <S {Boy}.> Concolinel.
775   *<S {Brag}.> Sweete Ayer, go tendernesse of yeares: take
776   *this Key, giue enlargement to the swaine,  bring him fe-stinatly
777   *hither: I must imploy him in a letter to my
778    Loue.
779    <S {Boy}.> Will you win your loue with a French braule?
780    <S {Bra}.> How meanest thou, brauling in French?
781   *<S {Boy}.> No my compleat master, but to Iigge off a tune
782   *at the tongues end, canarie to it with the feete, humour
783   *it with turning vp your eie: sigh a  note and sing a note,
784   *sometime through the throate: if you swallowed loue
785   *with singing, loue sometime through: nose as if you
786   *snuft vp loue by smelling loue with your hat penthouse-like
787   *ore the shop of your eies, with your armes crost on
788   *your thinbellie doublet, like a Rabbet on a spit, or your
789   *hands in your pocket, like a man after the old painting,
790   *and keepe not too long in one tune, but a snip and away:
791   *these are complements, these are humours, these betraie
792   *nice wenches that would be betraied without these, and
793   *make them men of note: do you note men that most are
794    affected to these?
795    <S {Brag}.> How hast thou purchased this experience?
796    <S {Boy}.> By my penne of obseruation.
797    <S {Brag}.> But O, but O.
798    <S {Boy}.> The Hobbie- horse is forgot.
799    <S {Bra}.> Cal'st thou  my loue Hobbi- horse.
800   *<S {Boy}.> No Master, the Hobbie- horse is but a Colt, and
801    and your Loue perhaps, a Hacknie:
802    but haue you forgot your Loue?
803    <S {Brag}.> Almost I had.
804    <S {Boy}.> Negligent student, learne her by heart.
805    <S {Brag}.> By heart, and in heart Boy.
806   *<S {Boy}.> And out of heart Master: all those three I will
807    proue.
808    <S {Brag}.> What wilt thou proue?
809   *<S {Boy}.> A man, if I liue (and this) by, in, and without, vp-on
810   *the instant: by heart you loue her, because your heart
811   *cannot come by her: in heart you loue her, because your
812   *heart is in loue with her: and out of heart you loue her,
813    being out of heart that you cannot enioy her.
814    <S {Brag}.> I am all these three.
815   *<S {Boy}.> And three times as much more, and yet nothing
816    at all.
817   *<S {Brag}.> Fetch hither the Swaine, he must carrie mee a
818    letter.
819   *<S {Boy}.> A message well simpathis'd, a Horse to be em-bassadour
820    for an Asse.
821    <S {Brag}.> Ha, ha, What saiest thou?
822   *<S {Boy}.> Marrie sir, you must send the Asse vpon the Horse
823    for he is verie slow gated: but I goe.
824    <S {Brag}.> The way is but short, away.
825    <S {Boy}.> As swift as Lead sir.
826   *<S {Brag}.> Thy meaning prettie ingenious, is not Lead a
827    mettall heauie, dull, and slow?
828    <S {Boy}.> {Minnime} honest Master, or rather Master no.
829    <S {Brag}.> I say Lead is slow.
830    <S {Boy}.> You are too swift sir to say so.
831    Is that Lead slow which is fir'd from a Gunne?
832    <S {Brag}.> Sweete smoke of Rhetorike,
833    He reputes me a Cannon, and the Bullet that's he:
834    I shoote thee at the Swaine.
835    <S {Boy}.> Thump then, and I flee.
836   *<S {Bra}.> A most acute Iuuenall, voluble and free of grace,
837    By thy fauour sweet Welkin, I must sigh in thy face.
838    Most rude melancholie, Valour giues thee place.
839    My Herald is return'd.
840    <D {Enter Page and Clowne}.>
841   *<S {Pag}.> A wonder Master, here's a {Costard} broken in a
842    shin.
843   *<S {Ar}.> Some enigma, some riddle, come, thy {Lenuoy}
844    begin.
845   *<S {Clo}.> No egma, no riddle, no {lenuoy}, no salue, in thee
846   *male sir. Or sir, Plantan, a plaine Plantan: no {lenuoy}, no
847    {lenuoy}, no Salue sir, but a Plantan.
848   *<S {Ar}.> By vertue, thou inforcest laughter, thy sillie
849   *thought,   my spleene, the heauing of my lunges prouokes
850   *me to rediculous smyling: O pardon me my stars, doth
851   *the inconsiderate take {salue} for {lenuoy}, and the word {len-uoy}
852    for a {salue}?
853   *<S {Pag}.> Doe the wise thinke them other, is not {lenuoy} a
854    {salue}?
855   *<S {Ar}.> No {Page}, it is an epilogue or discourse to make |(plaine,
856    Some obscure precedence that hath tofore bin faine.
857   *Now will I begin your morrall, and do you follow with
858    my {lenuoy}.
859    The Foxe, the Ape, and the Humble- Bee,
860    Were still at oddes, being but three.
861    <S {Arm}.> Vntill the Goose came out of doore,
862    Staying the oddes by adding foure.
863    <S {Pag}.> A good {Lenuoy}, ending in the Goose: would you
864    desire more?
865   *<S {Clo}.> The Boy hath sold him a bargaine, a Goose, that's |(flat.
      <P L5>
866    Sir, your penny- worth is good, #and your Goose be fat.
867    To sell a bargaine well is as cunning as fast and loose:
868    Let me see a fat {Lenuoy}, #I that's a fat Goose.
869    <S {Ar}.> Come hither, come hither:
870    How did this argument begin?
871    <S {Boy}.> By saying that a {Costard} was broken in a shin.
872    Then cal'd you for the {Lenuoy}.
873    <S {Clow}.> True, and I for a Plantan:
874    Thus came your argument in:
875   *Then the Boyes fat {Lenuoy}, the Goose that you bought,
876    And he ended the market.
877   *<S {Ar}.> But tell me: How was there a {Costard} broken in
878    a shin?
879    <S {Pag}.> I will tell you sencibly.
880    <S {Clow}.> Thou hast no feeling of it {Moth},
881    I will speake that {Lenuoy}.
882    I {Costard} running out, that was safely within,
883    Fell ouer the threshold, and broke my shin.
884    <S {Arm}.> We will talke no more of this matter.
885    <S {Clow}.> Till there be more matter in the shin.
886    <S {Arm}.> Sirra {Costard}, I will infranchise thee.
887   *<S {Clow}.> O, marrie me to one {Francis}, I smell some {Len-uoy},
888    some Goose in this.
889   *<S {Arm}.> By my sweete soule, I meane, setting thee at li-bertie.
890   *Enfreedoming thy person: thou wert emured,
891    restrained, captiuated, bound.
892   *<S {Clow}.> True, true, and now you will be  my purgation,
893    and let me loose.
894   *<S {Arm}.> I giue thee thy libertie, set thee from durance,
895   *and in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
896   *Beare this significant to the countrey Maide {Iaquenetta}:
897   *there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honours
898    is rewarding my dependants. {Moth}, follow.
899    <S {Pag}.> Like the sequell I.
900    Signeur {Costard} adew.  <D {Exit}.>
901   *<S {Clow}.> My sweete ounce of mans flesh, my in-conie
902    Iew: Now will I looke to his remuneration.
903   *Remuneration, O, that's the Latine word for three- far-things:
904   *Three- farthings remuneration, What's the price
905   *of this yncle? i.d. no, Ile giue you a remuneration: Why?
906   *It carries it remuneration: Why? It is a fairer name then
907   *a French- Crowne. I will neuer buy and sell out of this
908    word.
909    <D {Enter Berowne}.>
910   *<S {Ber}.> O my good knaue {Costard}, exceedingly well met.
911   *<S {Clow}.> Pray you sir, How much Carnation Ribbon
912    may a man buy for a remuneration?
913    <S {Ber}.> What is a remuneration?
914    <S {Cost}.> Marrie sir, halfe pennie farthing.
915    <S {Ber}.> O, Why then threefarthings worth of Silke.
916    <S {Cost}.> I thanke your worship, God be wy you.
917    <S {Ber}.> O stay slaue, I must employ thee:
918    As thou wilt win my fauour, good my knaue,
919    Doe one thing for me that I shall intreate.
920    <S {Clow}.> When would you haue it done sir?
921    <S {Ber}.> O this after- noone.
922    <S {Clo}.> Well, I will doe it sir: Fare you well.
923    <S {Ber}.> O thou knowest not what it is.
924    <S {Clo}.> I shall know sir, when I haue done it.
925    <S {Ber}.> Why villaine thou must know first.
926   *<S {Clo}.> I wil come to your worship to morrow morning.
927    <S {Ber}.> It must be done this after- noone,
928    Harke slaue, it is but this:
929    The Princesse comes to hunt here in the Parke,
930    And in her traine there is a gentle Ladie:
931   *When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
932    And {Rosaline} they call her, aske for her:
933    And to her white hand see thou do commend
934    This seal'd- vp counsaile. Ther's thy guerdon: goe.
935   *<S {Clo}.> Gardon, O sweete gardon, better then remune-ration,
936   *#a leuenpence- farthing better: most sweete gar-don.
937    I will doe it sir in print: gardon, remuneration.
938    <D {Exit}.>
939    <S {Ber}.> O, and I forsooth in loue,
940    I that haue beene loues whip?
941    A verie Beadle to a humerous sigh: A Criticke,
942    Nay, a night- watch Constable.
943    A domineering pedant ore the Boy,
944    Then whom no mortall so magnificent,
945    This wimpled, whyning, purblinde waiward Boy,
946    This signior {Iunios} gyant dwarfe, #don {Cupid},
947    Regent of Loue- rimes, Lord of folded armes,
948    Th' annointed soueraigne of sighes and groanes:
949    Liedge of all loyterers and malecontents:
950    Dread Prince of Placcats, King of Codpeeces.
951    Sole Emperator and great generall
952    Of trotting Parrators (O my little heart.)
953    And I to be a Corporall of his field,
954    And weare his colours like a Tumblers hoope.
955    What? I loue, I sue, I seeke a wife,
956    A woman that is like a Germane Cloake,
957    Still #a repairing: euer out of frame,
958    And neuer going #a right, being a Watch:
959    But being watcht, that it may still goe right.
960    Nay, to be periurde, which is worst of all:
961    And among three, to loue the worst of all,
962    A whitly wanton, with a veluet brow.
963    With two pitch bals stucke in her face for eyes.
964    #I, and by heauen, one that will doe the deede,
965    Though {Argus} were her Eunuch and her garde.
966    And I to sigh for her, to watch for her,
967    To pray for her, go to: it is a plague
968    That {Cupid} will impose for my neglect,
969    Of his almighty dreadfull little #might.
970    Well, I will loue, write, sigh, pray, shue, grone,
971    Some men must loue my Lady, and some Ione.

975   *<S {Qu}.> Was that the King that spurd his horse so hard,
976    Against the steepe vprising of the hill?
977    <S {Boy}.> I know not,  but I thinke it was not he.
978    <S {Qu}.> Who ere #a was, #a shew'd a mounting minde:
979    Well Lords, to day we shall haue our dispatch,
980    On Saterday we will returne to {France}.
981    Then {Forrester} my friend, Where is the Bush
982    That we must stand and play the murtherer in?
983    <S {For}.> Hereby vpon the edge of yonder Coppice,
984    A stand where you may make the fairest shoote.
985    <S {Qu}.> I thanke my beautie, I am faire that shoote,
986    And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoote.
987    <S {For}.> Pardon me Madam, for I meant not so.
988   *<S {Qu}.> What, what? First praise me, & then again say no.
989    O short liu'd pride. Not faire? alacke for woe.
      <P L5v>
990    <S {For}.> Yes Madam faire.
991    <S {Qu}.> Nay, neuer paint me now,
992    Where faire is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
993    Here (good my glasse) take this for telling true:
994    Faire paiment for foule words, is more then due.
995    <S {For}.> Nothing but faire is that which you inherit.
996    <S {Qu}.> See, see, my beautie will be sau'd by merit.
997    O heresie in faire, fit for these dayes,
998    A giuing hand, though foule, shall haue faire praise.
999    But come, the Bow: Now Mercie goes to kill,
1000   And shooting well, is then accounted #ill:
1001   Thus will I saue my credit in the shoote,
1002   Not wounding, pittie would not let me do't:
1003   If wounding, then it was to shew my skill,
1004   That more for praise, then purpose meant to kill.
1005   And out of question, so it is sometimes:
1006   Glory growes guiltie of detested crimes,
1007   When for Fames sake, for praise an outward part,
1008   We bend to that, the working of the hart.
1009   As I for praise alone now seeke to spill
1010   The poore Deeres blood, that my heart meanes no #ill.
1011  *<S {Boy}.> Do not curst wiues hold that selfe- soueraigntie
1012   Onely for praise sake, when they striue to be
1013   Lords ore their Lords?
1014   <S {Qu}.> Onely for praise, and praise we may afford,
1015   To any Lady that subdewes a Lord.
1016   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
1017   <S {Boy}.> Here comes a member of the common- wealth.

1020  *<S {Qu}.> Thou shalt know her fellow, by the rest that haue

1052  *did he see? to ouercome. To whom came he? to the
1053  *Begger. What saw he? the Begger. Who ouercame
1054  *he? the Begger. The conclusion is victorie: On whose
1055  *side? the King: the captiue is inricht: On whose side?
1056  *the Beggers. The catastrophe is a Nuptiall: on whose

1062  *for ragges, roabes: for tittles titles, for thy selfe

1089   To a Lady of {France}, that he call'd {Rosaline}.
1090  *<S {Qu}.> Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come Lords away.
1091   Here sweete, put vp this, 'twill be thine another day.
1092   <D {Exeunt}.>
1093   <S {Boy}.> Who is the shooter? Who is the shooter?
1094   <S {Rosa}.> Shall I teach you to know.
1095   <S {Boy}.> #I my continent of beautie.
1096   <S {Rosa}.> Why she that beares the Bow. Finely put off.
1097  *<S {Boy}.> My Lady goes to kill hornes, but if thou marrie,
1098   Hang me by the necke, if hornes that yeare miscarrie.
1099   Finely put on.
1100   <S {Rosa}.> Well then, I am the shooter.
1101   <S {Boy}.> And who is your Deare?
1102  *<S {Rosa}.> If we choose by the hornes, your selfe come not
1103   neare. Finely put on indeede.
1104  *<S {Maria}.> You still wrangle with her {Boyet}, and shee
1105   strikes at the brow.
1106   <S {Boyet}.> But she her selfe is hit lower:
1107   Haue I hit her now.
1108  *<S {Rosa}.> Shall I come vpon thee with an old saying, that
1109  *was a man when King {Pippin} of {France} was a little boy, as
1110   touching the hit it.
1111  *<S {Boyet}.> So I may answere thee with one as old that
1112  *was a woman when Queene {Guinouer} of {Brittaine} was a
1113   little wench, as touching the hit it.
      <P L6>
1114   <S {Rosa}.> Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
1115   Thou canst not hit it my good man.
1116   <S {Boy}.> I cannot, cannot, cannot:
1117   #And I cannot, another can.  <D {Exit}.>
1118   <S {Clo}.> By my troth most pleasant, how both did fit it.
1119  *<S {Mar}.> A marke marueilous well shot, for they both
1120   did hit.
1121  *<S {Boy}.> A mark, O marke but that marke: a marke saies
1122   my Lady.
1123  *Let the mark haue a pricke in't, to meat at, if it  may be.
1124  *<S {Mar}.> Wide a'th bow hand, yfaith your hand is out.
1125  *<S {Clo}.> Indeede #a' must shoote nearer, or heele ne're hit
1126   the clout.
1127  *<S {Boy}.> #And if my hand be out, then belike your hand
1128   is in.
1129  *<S {Clo}.> Then will shee get the vpshoot by cleauing the
1130   is in.
1131  *<S {Ma}.> Come, come, you talke greasely, your lips grow
1132   foule.
1133  *<S {Clo}.> She's too hard for you at pricks, sir challenge her
1134   to boule.
1135  *<S {Boy}.> I feare too much rubbing: good night my good
1136   Oule.
1137   <S {Clo}.> By my soule a Swaine, a most simple Clowne.
1138  *Lord, Lord, how the Ladies and I haue put him downe.
1139   O my troth most sweete iests, most inconie vulgar wit,
1140  *When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were,
1141   so fit.
1142   {Armathor} ath to the side, O a most dainty man.
1143   To see him walke before a Lady, and to beare her Fan.
1144  *To see him kisse his hand, and how most sweetly #a will
1145   sweare:
1146   And his Page atother side, that handfull of wit,
1147   Ah heauens, it is most patheticall nit.
1148   Sowla, sowla.  <D {Exeunt}.
1149   Shoote within.>
1150   <D {Enter Dull, Holofernes, the Pedant and Nathaniel}.>
1151  *<S {Nat}.> Very reuerent sport truely, and done in the testi-mony
1152   of a good conscience.
1153  *<S {Ped}.> The Deare was (as you know) sanguis in blood,
1154  *ripe as a Pomwater  who now hangeth like a Iewell in
1155  *the eare of {Celo} the skie; the welken the heauen, and a-non
1156  *falleth like a Crab on the face of {Terra}, the soyle, the
1157   land, the earth.
1158  *<S {Curat.Nath}.> Truely M[aster]. {Holofernes}, the epythithes are
1159  *sweetly varied like a scholler at the least: but sir I assure
1160   ye, it was a Bucke of the first head.
1161   <S {Hol}.> Sir {Nathaniel, haud credo}.
1162   <S {Dul}.> 'Twas not a {haud credo}, 'twas a Pricket.
1163  *<S {Hol}.> Most barbarous intimation: yet a kinde of insi-nuation,
1164  *as it were {in via}, in way of explication {facere}: as
1165  *it were replication, or rather {ostentare}, to show as it were
1166  *his inclination after his vndressed, vnpolished, vneduca-ted,
1167  *vnpruned, vntrained, or rather vnlettered, or rathe-rest
1168  *vnconfirmed fashion, to insert againe my {haud credo}
1169   for a Deare.
1170  *<S {Dul}.> I said the Deare was not a {haud credo}, 'twas a
1171   Pricket.
1172  *<S {Hol}.> Twice sod simplicitie, {bis coctus}, O thou mon-ster
1173   Ignorance, how deformed doost thou looke.
1174  *<S {Nath}.> Sir hee hath neuer fed of the dainties that are
1175   bred in a booke.
1176   He hath not eate paper as it were:
1177   He hath not drunke inke.
1178  *His intellect is not replenished, hee is onely an animall,
1179  *onely sensible in the duller parts: and such barren plants
1180  *are set before vs, that we thankfull should be: which we
1181  *taste and feeling, are for those parts that doe fructifie in
1182   vs more then he.
1183  *For as it would #ill become me to be vaine, indiscreet, or
1184   a foole;
1185  *So were there a patch set on Learning, to see him in a
1186   Schoole.
1187   But {omne #bene} say I, being of an old Fathers minde,
1188   Many can brooke the weather, that loue not the winde.
1189  *<S {Dul}.> You two are book- men: Can you tell by your
1190  *wit, What was a month old at {Cains} birth, that's not fiue
1191   weekes old as yet?
1192  *<S {Hol}.> {Dictisima} goodman {Dull, dictisima} goodman
1193   {#Dull}.
1194   <S {Dul}.> What is {dictima}?
1195   <S {Nath}.> A title to {Phebe}, to {Luna}, to the {Moone}.
1196  *<S {Hol}.> The Moone was a month old when {Adam} was
1197   no more.
1198  *And wrought not to fiue- weekes when he came to fiue-|(score.
1199   Th' allusion holds in the Exchange.
1200  *<S {Dul}.> 'Tis true indeede, the Collusion holds in the
1201   Exchange.
1202  *<S {Hol}.> God comfort thy capacity, I say th' allusion holds
1203   in the Exchange.
1204  *<S {Dul}.> And I say the polusion holds in the Exchange:
1205  *for the Moone is neuer but a month old: and I say be-side
1206   that, 'twas a Pricket that the Princesse kill'd.
1207  *<S {Hol}.> Sir {Nathaniel}, will you heare an extemporall
1208  *Epytaph on the death of the Deare, and to humour
1209  *the ignorant call'd the Deare, the Princesse kill'd a
1210   Pricket.
1211  *<S {Nath}.> {Perge}, good M[aster]. {Holofernes, perge}, so it shall
1212   please you to abrogate scurilitie.
1213  *<S {Hol}.> I will something affect a letter, for it argues
1214   facilitie.
1215   {The prayfull Princesse pearst and prickt}
1216   {a prettie pleasing Pricket},
1217   {Some say a Sore, but not a sore},
1218   {till now made sore with shooting}.
1219   {The Dogges did yell, put ell to Sore},
1220   {then Sorrell iumps from thicket:}
1221   {Or Pricket- sore, or else Sorell},
1222   {the people fall #a hooting}.
1223   {If Sore be sore, than ell to Sore},
1224   {makes fiftie sores #O sorell:}
1225   {Of one sore I an hundred make}
1226   {by adding but one more L}.
1227   <S {Nath}.> A rare talent.
1228  *<S {Dul}.> If a talent be a claw, looke how he clawes him
1229   with a talent.
1230  *<S {Nath}.> This is a gift that I haue simple: simple, a foo-lish
1231  *extrauagant spirit, full of formes, figures, shapes, ob-iects,
1232  *Ideas, apprehensions, motions, reuolutions. These
1233  *are begot in the ventricle of memorie, nourisht in the
1234  *wombe of primater, and deliuered vpon the mellowing
1235  *of occasion: but the gift is good in those in whom it is
1236   acute, and I am thankfull for it.
1237  *<S {Hol}.> Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my
1238  *parishioners, for their Sonnes are well tutor'd by you,
1239  *and their Daughters profit very greatly vnder you: you
1240   are a good member of the common- wealth.
1241  *<S {Nath}.> {Me hercle}, If their Sonnes be ingenuous, they
      <P L6v>
1242  *shall want no instruction: If their Daughters be capable,
1243  *I will put it to them. But {Vir sapis qui pauca loquitur}, a
1244   soule Feminine saluteth vs.
1245   <D {Enter Iaquenetta and the Clowne}.>
1246   <S {Iaqu}.> God giue you good morrow M[aster]. {Person}.
1247  *<S {Nath}.> Master Person, {quasi} Person? And if one should
1248   be perst, Which is the one?
1249  *<S {Clo}.> Marry M[aster]. Schoolemaster, hee that is likest to a
1250   hogshead.
1251  *<S {Nath}.> Of persing a Hogshead, a good luster of con-ceit
1252  *in a turph of Earth, Fire enough for a Flint, Pearle
1253   enough for a Swine: 'tis prettie, it is well.
1254  *<S {Iaqu}.> Good Master Parson be so good as reade mee
1255  *this Letter, it was giuen mee by {Costard}, and sent mee
1256   from {#Don Armatho}: I beseech you read it.
1257  *<S {Nath}.> {Facile precor gellida, quando pecas omnia sub vm-bra}
1258   {ruminat}, and so forth. Ah good old {Mantuan}, I
1259  *may speake of thee as the traueiler doth of {Venice, vem-chie},
1260  *{vencha, que non te vnde, que non te perreche}. Old {Man-tuan},
1261  *old {Mantuan}. Who vnderstandeth thee not, {vt re}
1262  *{sol #la mi fa}: Vnder pardon sir, What are the contents? or
1263   rather as {Horrace} sayes in his, What my soule verses.
1264   <S {Hol}.> #I sir, and very learned.
1265  *<S {Nath}.> Let me heare a staffe, a stanze, a verse, {Lege do-mine}.
1266  _
1267  *If Loue make me forsworne,  how shall I sweare to loue?
1268   Ah neuer faith could hold, if not to beautie vowed.
1269  *Though to my selfe forsworn, to thee Ile faithfull proue.
1270  *Those thoughts to mee were Okes, to thee like Osiers
1271   bowed.
1272  *Studie his byas   leaues, and makes his booke thine eyes.
1273  *Where all those pleasures liue, that #Art would compre-hend.
1274  _
1275   If knowledge be the marke, to know thee shall suffice.
1276  *Well learned is that tongue, that well can thee co[m]mend.
1277   All ignorant that soule, that sees thee without wonder.
1278   Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire;
1279  *Thy eye {Ioues} lightning beares, thy voyce his dreadfull
1280   thunder.
1281   Which not to anger bent, is musique, and sweete fire.
1282   Celestiall as thou art, Oh pardon loue this wrong,
1283   That sings heauens praise, with such an earthly tongue.
1284  *<S {Ped}.> You finde not the apostraphas, and so misse the
1285   accent. Let me superuise the cangenet.
1286  *<S {Nath}.> Here are onely numbers ratified, but for the
1287  *elegancy, facility, & golden cadence of poesie {caret}: {O-uiddius}
1288  *{Naso} was the man. And why in deed {Naso}, but
1289  *for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy? the
1290  *ierkes of inuention imitarie is nothing: So doth the
1291  *Hound his master, the Ape his keeper, the tyred Horse
1292  *his rider: But {Damosella virgin}, Was this directed to
1293   you?
1294  *<S {Iaq}.> #I sir from one mounsier {Berowne}, one of the
1295   strange Queenes Lords.
1296   <S {Nath}.> I will ouerglance the superscript.
1297  *{To the snow- white hand of the most beautious Lady} Rosaline.
1298  *I will looke againe on the intellect of the Letter, for
1299  *the nomination of the partie written to the person writ-ten
1300   vnto.
1301   {Your Ladiships in all desired imployment}, Berowne.
1302  *<S {Ped}.> Sir {Holofernes}, this {Berowne} is one of the Votaries
1303  *with the King, and here he hath framed a Letter to a se-quent
1304  *of the stranger Queens: which accidentally, or
1305  *by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and
1306  *goe my sweete, deliuer this Paper into the hand of the
1307  *King, it may concerne much: stay not thy complement, I
1308   forgiue thy duetie, adue.
1309   <S {Maid}.> Good {Costard} go with me:
1310   Sir God saue your life.
1311   <S {Cost}.> Haue with thee my girle.  <D {Exit}.>
1312  *<S {Hol}.> Sir you haue done this in the feare of God very
1313   religiously: and as a certaine Father saith
1314  *<S {Ped}.> Sir tell not me of the Father, I do feare coloura-ble
1315  *colours. But to returne to the Verses, Did they please
1316   you sir {Nathaniel}?
1317   <S {Nath}.> Marueilous well for the pen.
1318  *<S {Peda}.> I do dine to day at the fathers of a certaine Pu-pill
1319  *of mine, where if (being repast) it shall please you to
1320  *gratifie the table with a Grace, I will on my priuiledge I
1321  *haue with the parents of the foresaid Childe or Pupill,
1322  *vndertake your {bien venuto}, where I will proue those
1323  *Verses to be very vnlearned, neither sauouring of
1324  *Poetrie, Wit, nor Inuention. I beseech your So-cietie.
1325  _
1326  *<S {Nat}.> And thanke you to: for societie (saith the text)
1327   is the happinesse of life.
1328  *<S {Peda}.> And certes the text most infallibly concludes it.
1329  *Sir I do inuite you too, you shall not say me nay: {pauca}
1330   {verba}.
1331  *Away, the gentles are at their game, and we will to our
1332   recreation.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1333   <D {Enter Berowne with a Paper in his hand, alone}.>
1334   <S {Bero}.> The King he is hunting the Deare,
1335   I am coursing my selfe.
1336  *They haue pitcht a Toyle, I am toyling in a pytch,
1337  *pitch that defiles; defile, a foule word: Well, set thee
1338  *downe sorrow; for so they say the foole said, and so say
1339  *I, and I the foole: Well proued wit. By the Lord this
1340  *Loue is as mad as {Aiax}, it kils sheepe, it kils mee, I a
1341  *sheepe: Well proued againe #a my side. I will not loue;
1342  *if I do hang me: yfaith I will not. O but her eye: by
1343  *this light, but for her eye, I would not loue her; yes, for
1344  *her two eyes. Well, I doe nothing in the world but lye,
1345  *and lye in my throate. By heauen I doe loue, and it hath
1346  *taught mee to Rime, and to be mallicholie: and here is
1347  *part of my Rime, and heere my mallicholie. Well, she
1348  *hath one a'my Sonnets already, the Clowne bore it, the
1349  *Foole sent it, and the Lady hath it: sweet Clowne, swee-ter
1350  *Foole, sweetest Lady. By the world, I would not care
1351  *a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
1352   paper, God giue him grace to grone.
1353   <D {He stands aside}.  {The King entreth}.>
1354   <S {Kin}.> Ay mee!
1355  *<S {Ber}.> Shot by heauen: proceede sweet {Cupid}, thou hast
1356  *thumpt him with thy Birdbolt vnder the left pap: in faith
1357   secrets.
1358   <S {King}.> So sweete a kisse the golden Sunne giues not,
1359   To those fresh morning drops vpon the Rose,
1360   As thy eye beames, when their fresh rayse haue smot.
1361   The night of dew that on my cheekes downe flowes.
1362   Nor shines the siluer Moone one halfe so bright,
1363   Through the transparent bosome of the deepe,
1364   As doth thy face through teares of mine giue light:
1365   Thou shin'st in euery teare that I doe weepe,
1366   No drop, but as a Coach doth carry thee:
1367   So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
1368   Do but behold the teares that swell in me,
1369   And they thy glory through my griefe will show:
      <P M1><C C>
1370   But doe not loue thy selfe, then thou wilt keepe
1371   My teares for glasses, and still make me weepe.
1372   O Queene of Queenes, how farre dost thou excell,
1373   No thought can thinke, nor tongue of mortall tell.
1374   How shall she know my griefes? Ile drop the paper.
1375   Sweete leaues shade folly. Who is he comes heere?
1376   <D {Enter Longauile}.  {The King steps aside}.>
1377   What {Longauill}, and reading: listen eare.
1378   <S {Ber}.> Now in thy likenesse, one more foole appeare.
1379   <S {Long}.> Ay me, I am forsworne.
1380  *<S {Ber}.> Why he comes in like a periure, wearing papers.
1381   <S {Long}.> In loue I hope, sweet fellowship in shame.
1382   <S {Ber}.> One drunkard loues another of the name.
1383   <S {Lon}.> Am I the first y haue been periur'd so?
1384  *<S {Ber}.> I could put thee in comfort, not by two that I |(know,
1385  *Thou makest the triumphery, the corner cap of societie,
1386   The shape of Loues Tiburne, that hangs vp simplicitie.
1387  *<S {Lon}.> I feare these stubborn lines lack power to moue.
1388   O sweet {Maria}, Empresse of my Loue,
1389   These numbers will I teare, and write in prose.
1390   <S {Ber}.> O Rimes are gards on wanton {Cupids} hose,
1391   Disfigure not his Shop.
1392   <S {Lon}.> This same shall goe.  <D {He reades the Sonnet}.>
1393   {Did not the heauenly Rhetoricke of thine eye},

1404   {If broken then, it is no fault of mine:}
1405   {If by me broke, What foole is not so wise},
1406   {To loose an oath, to win a Paradise?}
1407  *<S {Ber}.> This is the liuer veine, which makes flesh a deity.
1408   A greene Goose, a Goddesse, pure pure Idolatry.
1409  *God amend vs, God amend, we are much out o'th' way.
1410   <D {Enter Dumaine}.>

1412   <S {Bero}.> All hid, all hid, an old infant play,
1413   Like a demie God, here sit I in the skie,
1414   And wretched fooles secrets heedfully ore- eye.
1415   More Sacks to the myll. O heauens I haue my wish,
1416   {Dumaine} transform'd, foure Woodcocks in a dish.
1417   <S {Dum}.> O most diuine {Kate}.
1418   <S {Bero}.> O most prophane coxcombe.
1419   <S {Dum}.> By heauen the wonder of a mortall eye.
1420   <S {Bero}.> By earth she is not, corporall, there you lye.
1421   <S {Dum}.> Her Amber haires for foule hath amber coted.
1422   <S {Ber}.> An Amber coloured Rauen was well noted.
1423   <S {Dum}.> As vpright as the Cedar.
1424   <S {Ber}.> Stoope I say, her shoulder is with- child.
1425   <S {Dum}.> As faire as day.
1426   <S {Ber}.> #I as some daies, but then no sunne must shine.
1427   <S {Dum}.> O that I had my wish?
1428   <S {Lon}.> And I had mine.
1429   <S {Kin}.> And mine too good Lord.
1430  *<S {Ber}.> Amen, so I had mine: Is not that a good word?
1431   <S {Dum}.> I would forget her, but a Feuer she
1432   Raignes in my bloud, and will remembred be.
1433   <S {Ber}.> A Feuer in your bloud, why then incision
1434   Would let her out in Sawcers, sweet misprision.
1435  *<S {Dum}.> Once more Ile read the Ode that I haue writ.

1443   {All vnseene, can passage finde}.
1444   {That the Louer sicke to death},
1445   {Wish himselfe the heauens breath}.
1446   {Ayre (quoth he) thy cheekes may blowe},
1447   {Ayre, would I might triumph so}.
1448   {But alacke my hand is sworne},
1449   {Nere to plucke thee from thy throne:}
1450   {Vow alacke for youth vnmeete},
1451   {youth so apt to plucke a sweet}.
1452   {Doe not call it sinne in me},
1453   {That I am forsworne for thee}.
1454   {Thou for whom} Ioue {would sweare},
1455   Iuno {but an Aethiop were},
1456   {And denie himselfe for} Ioue.
1457   {Turning mortall for thy Loue}.
1458   This will I send, and something else more plaine.
1459   That shall expresse my true- loues fasting paine.
1460   O would the {King, Berowne} and {Longauill},
1461   Were Louers too, #ill to example #ill,
1462   Would from my forehead wipe a periur'd note:
1463   For none offend, where all alike doe dote.
1464   <S {Lon}.> {Dumaine}, thy Loue is farre from charitie,
1465   That in Loues griefe desir'st societie:
1466   You may looke pale, but I should blush I know,
1467   To be ore- heard, and taken napping so.
1468   <S {Kin}.> Come sir, you blush: as his, your case is such,
1469   You chide at him, offending twice as much.
1470   You doe not loue {Maria}? {Longauile},
1471   Did neuer Sonnet for her sake compile;
1472   Nor neuer lay his wreathed armes athwart
1473   His louing bosome, to keepe downe his heart.
1474   I haue beene closely shrowded in this bush,
1475   And markt you both, and for you both did blush.
1476   I heard your guilty Rimes, obseru'd your fashion:
1477   Saw sighes reeke from you, noted well your passion.
1478   Aye me, sayes one! O {Ioue}, the other cries!
1479   On her haires were Gold, Christall the others eyes.
1480   You would for Paradise breake Faith and troth,
1481   And {Ioue} for your Loue would infringe an oath.
1482   What will {Berowne} say when that he shall heare
1483   Faith infringed, which such zeale did sweare.
1484   How will he scorne? how will he spend his wit?
1485   How will he triumph, leape, and laugh at it?
1486   For all the wealth that euer I did see,
1487   I would not haue him know so much by me.
1488   <S {Bero}.> Now step I forth to whip hypocrisie.
1489   Ah good my Liedge, I pray thee pardon me.
1490   Good heart, What grace hast thou thus to reproue
1491   These wormes for louing, that art most in loue?
1492   Your eyes doe make no   couches in your teares.
1493   There is no certaine Princesse that appeares.
1494   You'll not be periur'd, 'tis a hatefull thing:
1495   Tush, none but Minstrels like of Sonnetting.
1496   But are you not asham'd? nay, are you not
      <P M1v>
1497   All three of you, to be thus much ore'shot?
1498   You found his Moth, the King your Moth did see:
1499   But I a Beame doe finde in each of three.
1500   O what a Scene of fool'ry haue I seene.
1501   Of sighes, of grones, of sorrow, and of teene:
1502   O me, with what strict patience haue I sat,
1503   To see a King transformed to a Gnat?
1504   To see great {Hercules} whipping a Gigge,
1505   And profound {Salomon} tuning a Iygge?
1506   And {Nestor} play at push- pin with the boyes,
1507   And {Critticke Tymon} laugh at idle toyes.
1508   Where lies thy griefe? O tell me good {Dumaine};
1509   And gentle {Longauill}, where lies thy paine?
1510   And where  my Liedges? all about the brest:
1511   A Candle hoa!
1512   <S {Kin}.> Too bitter is thy iest.
1513   Are wee betrayed thus to thy ouer- view?
1514   <S {Ber}.> Not you by me, but I betrayed to you.
1515   I that am honest, I that hold it sinne
1516   To breake the vow I am ingaged in.
1517   I am betrayed by keeping company
1518   With men, like men of inconstancie.
1519   When shall you see me write a thing in rime?
1520   Or grone for {Ioane}? or spend a minutes time,
1521  *In pruning mee, when shall you heare that I will praise a
1522  *hand, a foot, a face, an eye: a gate, a state, a brow, a brest,
1523   a waste, a legge, a limme.
1524   <S {Kin}.> Soft, Whither a-way so fast?
1525   A true man, or a theefe, that gallops so.
1526   <S {Ber}.> I post from Loue, good Louer let me go.
1527   <D {Enter Iaquenetta and Clowne}.>
1528   <S {Iaqu}.> God blesse the King.
1529   <S {Kin}.> What Present hast thou there?
1530   <S {Clo}.> Some certaine treason.
1531   <S {Kin}.> What makes treason heere?
1532   <S {Clo}.>   Nay it makes nothing sir.
1533   <S {Kin}.> If it marre nothing neither,
1534   The treason and you goe in peace away together.
1535   <S {Iaqu}.> I beseech your Grace let this Letter be read,
1536   Our person mis- doubts it: it was treason he said.
1537   <S {Kin}.> {Berowne}, read it ouer.  <D {He reades the Letter}.>
1538   <S {Kin}.> Where hadst thou it?
1539   <S {Iaqu}.> Of {Costard}.
1540   <S {King}.> Where hadst thou it?
1541   <S {Cost}.> Of {Dun Adramadio}, {Dun Adramadio}.
1542  *<S {Kin}.> How now,  what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
1543  *<S {Ber}.> A toy my Liedge, a toy: your grace needes not
1544   feare it.
1545  *<S {Long}.> It did moue him  to passion, and therefore let's
1546   heare it.
1547   <S {Dum}.> It is {Berowns} writing, and heere is his name.
1548  *<S {Ber}.> Ah you whoreson loggerhead, you were borne
1549   to doe me shame.
1550   Guilty my Lord, guilty: I confesse, I confesse.
1551   <S {Kin}.> What?
1552  *<S {Ber}.> That you three fooles, lackt mee foole, to make
1553   vp the messe.
1554   He, he, and you: and you my Liedge, and I,
1555   Are picke- purses in Loue, and we deserue to die.
1556   O dismisse this audience, and I shall tell you more.
1557   <S {Dum}.> Now the number is euen.
1558  *<S {Berow}.> True true, we are fowre: will these Turtles
1559   be gone?
1560   <S {Kin}.> Hence sirs, away.
1561  *<S {Clo}.> Walk aside the true folke, & let the traytors stay.
1562  *<S {Ber}.> Sweet Lords, sweet Louers, O let vs imbrace,
1563   As true we are as flesh and bloud can be,
1564   The Sea will ebbe and flow, heauen will shew his face:
1565   Young bloud doth not obey an old decree.
1566   We cannot crosse the cause why we are borne:
1567   Therefore of all hands must we be forsworne.
1568  *<S {King}.> What, did these rent lines shew some loue of
1569   thine?
1570  *<S {Ber}.> Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heauenly |({Rosaline},
1571   That (like a rude and sauage man of {Inde}.)
1572   At the first opening of the gorgeous East,
1573   Bowes not his vassall head, and strooken blinde,
1574   Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
1575   What peremptory Eagle- sighted eye
1576   Dares looke vpon the heauen of her brow,
1577   That is not blinded by her maiestie?
1578  *<S {Kin}.> What zeale, what furie, hath inspir'd thee now?
1579   My Loue (her Mistres) is a gracious Moone,
1580   Shee (an attending Starre) scarce seene a light.
1581   <S {Ber}.> My eyes are then no eyes, nor I {Berowne}.
1582   O, but for my Loue, day would turne to night,
1583   Of all complexions the cul'd soueraignty,
1584   Doe meet as at a faire in her faire cheeke,
1585   Where   seuerall Worthies make one dignity,
1586   Where nothing wants, that want it selfe doth seeke.
1587   Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,
1588   Fie painted Rethoricke, O she needs it not,
1589   To things of sale, a sellers praise belongs:
1590   She passes prayse, then prayse too short doth blot.
1591   A withered Hermite, fiuescore winters worne,
1592   Might shake off fiftie, looking in her eye:
1593   Beauty doth varnish Age, as if new borne,
1594   And giues the Crutch the Cradles infancie.
1595   O 'tis the Sunne that maketh all things shine.
1596   <S {King}.> By heauen, thy Loue is blacke as Ebonie.
1597   <S {Berow}.> Is Ebonie like her? O word diuine?
1598   A wife of such wood were felicite.
1599   O who can giue an oth? Where is a booke?
1600   That I may sweare Beauty doth beauty lacke,
1601   If that she learne not of her eye to looke:
1602   No face is faire that is not full so blacke.
1603   <S {Kin}.> O paradoxe, Blacke is the badge of #hell,
1604   The hue of dungeons, and the Schoole of night:
1605   And beauties crest becomes the heauens well.
1606  *<S {Ber}.> Diuels soonest tempt resembling spirits of light.
1607   O if in blacke my Ladies browes be deckt,
1608   It mournes, that painting vsurping haire
1609   Should rauish doters with a false aspect:
1610   And therfore is she borne to make blacke, faire.
1611   Her fauour turnes the fashion of the dayes,
1612   For natiue bloud is counted painting now:
1613   And therefore red that would auoyd dispraise,
1614   Paints it selfe blacke, to imitate her brow.
1615  *<S {Dum}.> To look like her are Chimny- sweepers blacke.
1616   <S {Lon}.> And since her time, are Colliers counted bright.
1617   <S {King}.> And {Aethiops} of their sweet complexion crake.
1618   <S {Dum}.> Dark needs no Candles now, for dark is light.
1619   <S {Ber}.> Your mistresses dare neuer come in raine,
1620   For feare their colours should be washt away.
1621  *<S {Kin}.> 'Twere good yours did: for sir to tell you plaine,
1622   Ile finde a fairer face not washt to day.
1623  *<S {Ber}.> Ile proue her faire, or talke till dooms- day here.
1624  *<S {Kin}.> No Diuell will fright thee then so much as shee.
1625   <S {Duma}.> I neuer knew man hold vile stuffe so deere.
1626  *<S {Lon}.> Looke, heer's thy loue, my foot and her face see.
1627   <S {Ber}.> O if the streets were paued with thine eyes,
      <P M2>
1628   Her feet were much too dainty for such tread.
1629   <S {Duma}.> O vile, then as she goes what vpward lyes?
1630   The street should see as she walk'd ouer head.
1631   <S {Kin}.> But what of this, are we not all in loue?
1632   <S {Ber}.> O nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworne.
1633  *<S {Kin}.> Then leaue this chat, & good {Berown} now proue
1634   Our louing lawfull, and our fayth not torne.
1635   <S {Dum}.> #I marie there, some flattery for this euill.
1636   <S {Long}.> O some authority how to proceed,
1637   Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the diuell.
1638   <S {Dum}.> Some salue for periurie,
1639   <S {Ber}.> O 'tis more then neede.
1640   Haue at you then affections men at armes,
1641   Consider what you first did sweare vnto:
1642   To fast, to study, and to see no woman:
1643   Flat treason against the Kingly state of youth.
1644   Say, Can you fast? your stomacks are too young:
1645   And abstinence ingenders maladies.
1646   And where that you haue vow'd to studie (Lords)
1647   In that each of you haue forsworne his Booke.
1648   Can you still dreame and pore, and thereon looke.
1649   For when would you my Lord, or you, or you,
1650   Haue found the ground of studies excellence,
1651   Without the beauty of a womans face;
1652   From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue,
1653   They are the Ground, the Bookes, the Achadems,
1654   From whence doth spring the true {Promethean} fire.
1655   Why, vniuersall plodding poysons vp
1656   The nimble spirits in the arteries,
1657   As motion and long during action tyres
1658   The sinnowy vigour of the trauailer.
1659   Now for not looking on a womans face,
1660   You haue in that forsworne the vse of eyes:
1661   And studie too, the causer of your vow.
1662   For where is any Author in the world,
1663   Teaches such beauty as a womans eye:
1664   Learning is but an adiunct to our selfe,
1665   And where we are, our Learning likewise is.
1666   Then when our selues we see in Ladies eyes,
1667   With our selues.
1668   Doe we not likewise see our learning there?
1669   O we haue made a Vow to studie, Lords,
1670   And in that vow we haue forsworne our Bookes:
1671   For when would you (my Leege) or you, or you?
1672   In leaden contemplation haue found out
1673   Such fiery Numbers as the prompting eyes,
1674   Of beauties tutors haue inrich'd you with:
1675   Other slow Arts intirely keepe the braine:
1676   And therefore finding barraine practizers,
1677   Scarce shew a haruest of their heauy toyle.
1678   But Loue first learned in a Ladies eyes,
1679   Liues not alone emured in the braine:
1680   But with the motion of all elements,
1681   Courses as swift as thought in euery power,
1682   And giues to euery power a double power,
1683   Aboue their functions and their offices.
1684   It addes a precious seeing to the eye:
1685   A Louers eyes will gaze an Eagle blinde.
1686   A Louers eare will heare the lowest sound.
1687   When the suspicious head of theft is stopt.
1688   Loues feeling is more soft and sensible,
1689   Then are the tender hornes of Cockle Snayles.
1690   Loues tongue proues dainty, {Bachus} grosse in taste,
1691   For Valour, is not Loue a {Hercules}?
1692   Still climing trees in the {Hesperides}.
1693   Subtill as {Sphinx}, as sweet and musicall,
1694   As bright {Apollo's} Lute, strung with his haire.
1695   And when Loue speakes, the voyce of all the Gods,
1696   Make heauen drowsie with the harmonie.
1697   Neuer durst Poet touch a pen to write,
1698   Vntill his Inke were tempred with Loues sighes:
1699   O then his lines would rauish sauage eares,
1700   And plant in Tyrants milde humilitie.
1701   From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue.
1702   They sparcle still the right promethean fire,
1703   They are the Bookes, the Arts, the Achademes,
1704   That shew, containe, and nourish all the world.
1705   Else none at all in ought proues excellent.
1706   Then fooles you were these women to forsweare:
1707   Or keeping what is sworne, you will proue fooles,
1708   For Wisedomes sake, a word that all men loue:
1709   Or for Loues sake, a word that loues all men.
1710   Or for Mens sake, the author of these Women:
1711   Or Womens sake, by whom we men are Men.
1712   Let's once loose our oathes to finde our selues,
1713   Or else we loose our selues, to keepe our oathes:
1714   It is religion to be thus forsworne.
1715   For Charity it selfe fulfills the Law:
1716   And who can seuer loue from Charity.
1717   <S {Kin}.> Saint {Cupid} then, and Souldiers to the field.
1718  *<S {Ber}.> Aduance your standards, & vpon them Lords,
1719   Pell, mell, downe with them: but be first aduis'd,
1720   In conflict that you get the Sunne of them.
1721   <S {Long}.> Now to plaine dealing, Lay these glozes by,
1722   Shall we resolue to woe these girles of France?
1723   <S {Kin}.> And winne them too, therefore let vs deuise,
1724   Some entertainment for them in their Tents.
1725  *<S {Ber}.> First from the Park let vs conduct them thither,
1726   Then homeward euery man attach the hand
1727   Of his faire Mistresse, in the afternoone
1728   We will with some strange pastime solace them:
1729   Such as the shortnesse of the time can shape,
1730   For Reuels, Dances, Maskes, and merry houres,
1731  *Fore- runne faire Loue, strewing her way with flowres.
1732   <S {Kin}.> Away, away, no time shall be omitted,
1733   That will be time, and may by vs be fitted.
1734  *<S {Ber}.> Alone, alone sowed Cockell, reap'd no Corne,
1735   And Iustice alwaies whirles in equall measure:
1736   Light Wenches may proue plagues to men forsworne,
1737   If so, our Copper buyes no better treasure.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1738   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1739   <D {Enter the Pedant, Curate and Dull}.>
1740   <S {Pedant}.> {Satis quid sufficit}.
1741  *<S {Curat}.> I praise God for you sir, your reasons at dinner
1742  *haue beene sharpe & sententious: pleasant without scur-rillity,
1743  *witty without affection, audacious without im-pudency,
1744  *learned without opinion, and strange without
1745  *heresie: I did conuerse this {quondam} day with a compa-nion
1746  *of the Kings, who is intituled, nominated, or called,
1747   {#Don Adriano de Armatho}.
1748  *<S {Ped}.> {Noui hominum tanquam te}, His humour is lofty,
1749  *his discourse peremptorie: his tongue filed, his eye
1750  *ambitious, his gate maiesticall, and his generall behaui-our
1751  *vaine, ridiculous, and thrasonicall. He is too picked,
1752  *too spruce, too affected, too odde, as it were, too pere-grinat,
1753   as I may call it.
      <P M2v>
1754   <S {Curat}.> A most singular and choise Epithat,
1755   <D {Draw out his Table- booke}.>
1756  *<S {Peda}.> He draweth out the thred of his verbositie, fi-ner
1757  *then the staple of his argument. I abhor such pha-naticall
1758  *phantasims, such insociable and poynt deuise
1759  *companions, such rackers of ortagriphie, as to speake
1760  *dout fine, when he should say doubt; det, when he shold
1761  *pronounce debt; debt, not det: he clepeth a Calf, Caufe:

1775   <S {Ped}.> Most millitarie sir salutation.
1776  *<S {Boy}.> They haue beene at a great feast of Languages,
1777   and stolne the scraps.
1778  *<S {Clow}.> O they haue liu'd long on the almes- basket   of

1783   <S {Page}.> Peace, the peale begins.

1786  *What is Ab speld backward with the horn on his head?
1787   <S {Peda}.> Ba, {puericia} with a horne added.

1809  *very Remuneration I had of thy Maister, thou halfpenny
1810  *purse of wit, thou Pidgeon- egge of discretion. O & the
1811  *heauens were so pleased, that thou wert but my Bastard;
1812  *What a ioyfull father wouldst thou make mee? Goe to,
1813   thou hast it {ad dungil}, at the fingers ends, as they say.
1814   <S {Peda}.> Oh I smell false Latine, {dunghel} for {vnguem}.
1815  *<S {Brag}.> {Arts- man preambulat}, we will bee singled from
1816  *the barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the Charg-house
1817   on the top of the Mountaine?
1818   <S {Peda}.> Or {Mons} the hill.
1819   <S {Brag}.> At your sweet pleasure, for the Mountaine.
1820   <S {Peda}.> I doe {sans question}.
1821  *<S {Bra}.> Sir, it is the Kings most sweet pleasure and af-fection,
1822  *to congratulate the Princesse at her Pauilion, in
1823  *the {posteriors} of this day, which the rude multitude call
1824   the after- noone.
1825  *<S {Ped}.> The {posterior} of the day, most generous sir, is lia-ble,
1826  *congruent, and measurable for the after- noone: the
1827  *word is well culd, chose, sweet, and apt I doe assure you
1828   sir, I doe assure.
1829  *<S {Brag}.> Sir, the King is a noble Gentleman, and my fa-miliar,
1830  *I doe assure ye very good friend: for what is in-ward
1831  *betweene vs, let it passe. I doe beseech thee re-member
1832  *thy curtesie. I beseech thee apparell thy head:
1833  *and among other importunate & most serious designes,
1834  *and of great import indeed too: but let that passe, for I
1835  *must tell thee it will please his Grace (by the world)
1836  *sometime to leane vpon my poore shoulder, and with
1837  *his royall finger thus dallie with my excrement, with my
1838  *mustachio: but sweet heart let that passe. By the world
1839  *I recount no fable, some certaine speciall honours it
1840  *pleaseth his greatnesse to impart to {Armado} a Souldier,
1841  *a man of trauell, that hath seene the world: but let that
1842  *passe; the very all of all is: but sweet heart I do implore
1843  *secrecie, that the King would haue mee present the
1844  *Princesse (sweet chucke) with some delightfull ostenta-tion,
1845  *or show, or pageant, or anticke, or fire- worke:
1846  *Now, vnderstanding that the Curate and your sweet self
1847  *are good at such eruptions, and sodaine breaking out of
1848  *myrth (as it were) I haue acquainted you withall, to
1849   the end to craue your assistance.
1850  *<S {Peda}.> Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Wor-thies.
1851  *Sir {Holofernes}, as concerning some entertainment
1852  *of time, some show in the posterior of this day, to bee
1853  *rendred by our assistants the Kings command: and this
1854  *most gallant, illustrate and learned Gentleman, before
1855  *the Princesse: I say none so fit as to present the Nine
1856   Worthies.
1857  *<S {Curat}.> Where will you finde men worthy enough to
1858   present them?
1859  *<S {Peda}.> {Iosua}, your selfe: my selfe, and this gallant gen-tleman
1860  *{Iudas Machabeus}; this Swaine (because of his
1861  *great limme or ioynt) shall passe {Pompey} the great, the
1862   Page {Hercules}.
1863  *<S {Brag}.> Pardon sir, error: He is not quantitie enough
1864  *for that Worthies thumb, hee is not so big as the end of
1865   his Club.
1866  *<S {Peda}.> Shall I haue audience: he shall present {Hercu-les}
1867  *in minoritie: his {#enter} and {#exit} shall bee strangling a
1868   Snake; and I will haue an Apologie for that purpose.
1869  *<S {Pag}.> An excellent deuice: so if any of the audience
1870  *hisse, you may cry, Well done {Hercules}, now thou cru-shest
1871  *the Snake; that is the way to make an offence gra-cious,
1872   though few haue the grace to doe it.
1873   <S {Brag}.> For the rest of the Worthies?
1874   <S {Peda}.> I will play three my selfe.
1875   <S {Pag}.> Thrice worthy Gentleman.
1876   <S {Brag}.> Shall I tell you a thing?
1877   <S {Peda}.> We attend.
1878  *<S {Brag}.> We will haue, if this fadge not, an Antique. I
1879   beseech you follow.
1880  *<S {Ped}.> {Via} good- man {Dull}, thou hast spoken no word
1881   all this while.
1882   <S {Dull}.> Nor vnderstood none neither sir.
1883   <S {Ped}.> Alone, we will employ thee.
1884  *<S {Dull}.> Ile make one in a dance, or so: or I will play
      <P M3>
1885  *on the taber to the Worthies, & let them dance the hey.
1886   <S {Ped}.> Most {Dull}, honest {Dull}, to our sport away.  <D {Exit}.>
1887   <D {Enter Ladies}.>
1888   <S {Qu}.> Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart,
1889   If fairings come thus plentifully in.
1890  *A Lady wal'd about with Diamonds: Look you, what I
1891   haue from the louing King.
1892   <S {Rosa}.> Madam, came nothing else along with that?
1893   <S {Qu}.> Nothing but this: yes as much loue in Rime,
1894   As would be cram'd vp in a sheet of paper
1895   Writ on both sides the leafe, margent and all,
1896   That he was faine to seale on {Cupids} name.
1897  *<S {Rosa}.> That was the way to make his god- head wax:
1898   For he hath beene fiue thousand yeeres a Boy.
1899   <S {Kath}.> #I, and a shrewd vnhappy gallowes too.
1900  *<S {Ros}.> You'll nere be friends with him, #a kild your sister.
1901  *<S {Kath}.> He made her melancholy, sad, and heauy, and
1902  *so she died: had she beene Light like you, of such a mer-rie
1903  *nimble stirring spirit, she might #a bin a Grandam ere
1904  *she died. And so may you: For a light heart liues long.
1905  *<S {Ros}.> What's your darke meaning mouse, of this light
1906   word?
1907   <S {Kat}.> A light condition in a beauty darke.
1908  *<S {Ros}.> We need more light to finde your meaning out.
1909   <S {Kat}.> You'll marre the light by taking it in snuffe:
1910   Therefore Ile darkely end the argument.
1911   <S {Ros}.> Look what you doe, you doe it stil i'th darke.
1912   <S {Kat}.> So do not you, for you are a light Wench.
1913   <S {Ros}.> Indeed I waigh not you, and therefore light.
1914  *<S {Ka}.> You waigh me not, O that's you care not for me.
1915   <S {Ros}.> Great reason: for past care, is still past cure.
1916   <S {Qu}.> Well bandied both, a set of Wit well played.
1917   But {Rosaline}, you haue a Fauour too?
1918   Who sent it? and what is it?
1919   <S {Ros}.> I would you knew.
1920   #And if my face were but as faire as yours,
1921   My Fauour were as great, be witnesse this.
1922   Nay, I haue Verses too, I thanke {Berowne},
1923   The numbers true, and were the numbring too.
1924   I were the fairest goddesse on the ground.
1925   I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.
1926   O he hath drawne my picture in his letter.
1927   <S {Qu}.> Any thing like?
1928   <S {Ros}.> Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.
1929   <S {Qu}.> Beauteous as Incke: a good conclusion.
1930   <S {Kat}.> Faire as a text B. in a Coppie booke.
1931  *<S {Ros}.> Ware pensals. How? Let me  not die your debtor,
1932   My red Dominicall, my golden letter.
1933   O that your face were full of Oes.
1934   <S {Qu}.> A Pox of that iest, and I beshrew all Shrowes:
1935   But {Katherine}, what was sent to you
1936   From faire {Dumaine}?
1937   <S {Kat}.> Madame, this Gloue.
1938   <S {Qu}.> Did he not send you twaine?
1939   <S {Kat}.> Yes Madame: and moreouer,
1940   Some thousand Verses of a faithfull Louer.
1941   A huge translation of hypocrisie,
1942   Vildly compiled, profound simplicitie.
1943   <S {Mar}.> This, and these Pearls, to me sent {Longauile}.
1944   The Letter is too long by halfe a mile.
1945   <S {Qu}.> I thinke no lesse: Dost thou wish in heart
1946   The Chaine were longer, and the Letter short.
1947   <S {Mar}.> #I, or I would these hands might neuer part.
1948   <S {Quee}.> We are wise girles to mocke our Louers so.
1949   <S {Ros}.> They are worse fooles to purchase mocking so.
1950   That same {Berowne} ile torture ere I goe.
1951   O that I knew he were but in by th' weeke,
1952   How I would make him fawne, and begge, and seeke,
1953   And wait the season, and obserue the times,
1954   And spend his prodigall wits in booteles rimes,
1955   And shape his seruice wholly to my deuice,
1956   And make him proud to make me proud that iests.
1957   So pertaunt like would I o'resway his state,
1958   That he shold be my foole, and I his fate.
1959  *<S {Qu}.> None are so surely caught, when they are catcht,
1960   As Wit turn'd foole, follie in Wisedome hatch'd:
1961   Hath wisedoms warrant, and the helpe of Schoole,
1962   And Wits owne grace to grace a learned Foole?
1963  *<S {Ros}.> The bloud of youth burns not with such excesse,
1964   As grauities reuolt to wantons be.
1965   <S {Mar}.> Follie in Fooles beares not so strong a note,
1966   As fool'ry in the Wise, when Wit doth dote:
1967   Since all the power thereof it doth apply,
1968   To proue by Wit, worth in simplicitie.
1969   <D {Enter Boyet}.>
1970   <S {Qu}.> Heere comes {Boyet}, and mirth in his face.
1971  *<S {Boy}.> O I am stab'd with laughter, Wher's her Grace?
1972   <S {Qu}.> Thy newes {Boyet}?
1973   <S {Boy}.> Prepare Madame, prepare.
1974   Arme Wenches arme, incounters mounted are,
1975   Against your Peace, Loue doth approach, disguis'd:
1976   Armed in arguments, you'll be surpriz'd.
1977   Muster your Wits, stand in your owne defence,
1978   Or hide your heads like Cowards, and flie hence.
1979   <S {Qu}.> Saint {Dennis} to S[aint]. {Cupid}: What are they,
1980   That charge their breath against vs? Say scout say.
1981   <S {Boy}.> Vnder the coole shade of a Siccamore,
1982   I thought to close mine eyes some halfe an houre:
1983   When lo to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
1984   Toward   that shade I might behold addrest,
1985   The King and his companions: warely
1986   I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
1987   And ouer- heard, what you shall ouer- heare:
1988   That #by and by disguis'd they will be heere.
1989   Their Herald is a pretty knauish Page:
1990   That well by heart hath con'd his embassage,
1991   Action and accent did they teach him there.
1992   Thus must thou speake, and thus thy body beare.
1993   And euer and anon they made a doubt,
1994   Presence maiesticall would put him out:
1995   For quoth the King, an Angell shalt thou see:
1996   Yet feare not thou, but speake audaciously.
1997   The Boy reply'd, An Angell is not euill:
1998   I should haue fear'd her, had she beene a deuill.
1999   With that all laugh'd, and clap'd him on the shoulder,
2000   Making the bold wagg by their praises bolder.
2001   One rub'd his elboe thus, and fleer'd, and swore,
2002   A better speech was neuer spoke before.
2003   Another with his finger and his thumb,
2004   Cry'd {via}, we will doo't, come what will come.
2005   The third he caper'd and cried, All goes well.
2006   The fourth turn'd on the toe, and downe he fell:
2007   With that they all did tumble on the ground,
2008   With such a zelous laughter so profound,
2009   That in this spleene ridiculous appeares,
2010   To checke their folly passions solemne teares.
2011   <S {Que}.> But what, but what, come they to visit vs?
2012   <S {Boy}.>   They do, they do; and are apparel'd thus,
2013   Like {Muscouites}; or {Russians}, as I gesse.
2014   Their purpose is to parlee, to court, and dance,
      <P M3v>
2015   And euery one his Loue- feat will aduance,
2016   Vnto his seuerall mistresse: which they'll know
2017   By fauours seuerall, which they did bestow.
2018  *<S {Queen}.> And will they so? the Gallants shall be taskt:
2019   For Ladies; we will euery one be maskt,
2020   And not a man of them shall haue the grace
2021   Despight of sute, to see a Ladies face.
2022   Hold {Rosaline}, this Fauour thou shalt weare,
2023   And then the King will court thee for his Deare:
2024   Hold, take thou this my sweet, and giue me thine,
2025   So shall {Berowne} take me for {Rosaline}.
2026   And change your Fauours too, so shall your Loues
2027   Woo contrary, deceiu'd by these remoues.
2028  *<S {Rosa}.> Come on then, weare the fauours most in sight.
2029   <S {Kath}.> But in this changing, What is your intent?
2030   <S {Queen}.> The effect of my intent is to crosse theirs:
2031   They doe it but in mocking merriment,
2032   And mocke for mocke is onely my intent.
2033   Their seuerall counsels they vnbosome shall,
2034   To Loues mistooke, and so be mockt withall.
2035   Vpon the next occasion that we meete,
2036   With Visages displayd to talke and greete.
2037   <S {Ros}.> But shall we dance, if they desire vs too't?
2038   <S {Quee}.> No, to the death we will not moue a foot,
2039   Nor to their pen'd speech render we no grace:
2040   But while 'tis spoke, each turne away his face.
2041  *<S {Boy}.> Why that contempt will kill the keepers heart,
2042   And quite diuorce his memory from his part.
2043   <S {Quee}.> Therefore I doe it, and I make no doubt,
2044   The rest will ere come in, if he be out.
2045   Theres no such sport, as sport by sport orethrowne:
2046   To make theirs ours, and ours none but our owne.
2047   So shall we stay mocking entended game,
2048   And they well mockt, depart away with shame.  <D {Sound}.>
2049  *<S {Boy}.> The Trompet sounds, be maskt, the maskers
2050   come.
2051  *<D {Enter Black moores with musicke, the Boy with a speech},
2052   {and the rest of the Lords disguised}.>
2053   <S {Page}.> {All haile, the richest Beauties on the earth}.
2054   <S {Ber}.> Beauties no richer then rich Taffata.
2055  *<S {Pag}.> {A holy parcell of the fairest dames that euer turn'd}
2056   {their backes to mortall viewes}.
2057   <D The Ladies turne their backes to him.>
2058   <S {Ber}.> Their eyes villaine, their eyes.
2059   <S {Pag}.> {That euer turn'd their eyes to mortall viewes}.
2060   {Out}
2061   <S {Boy}.> True, out indeed.
2062   <S {Pag}.> {Out of your fauours heauenly spirits vouchsafe}
2063   {Not to beholde}.
2064   <S {Ber}.> Once to behold, rogue.
2065   <S {Pag}.> {Once to behold with your Sunne beamed eyes},
2066   {With your Sunne beamed eyes}.
2067   <S {Boy}.> They will not answer to that Epythite,
2068   you were best call it Daughter beamed eyes.
2069  *<S {Pag}.> They do not marke me, and that brings me out.
2070   <S {Bero}.> Is this your perfectnesse? be gon you rogue.
2071   <S {Rosa}.> What would these strangers?
2072   Know their mindes {Boyet}.
2073   If they doe speake our language, 'tis our #will
2074   That some plaine man recount their purposes.
2075   Know what they would?
2076   <S {Boyet}.> What would you with the Princes?
2077   <S {Ber}.> Nothing but peace, and gentle visitation.
2078   <S {Ros}.> What would they, say they?
2079   <S {Boy}.> Nothing but peace, and gentle visitation.
2080   <S {Rosa}.> Why that they haue, and bid them so be gon.
2081   <S {Boy}.> She saies you haue it, and you may be gon.
2082   <S {Kin}.> Say to her we haue measur'd many miles,
2083   To tread a Measure with you on the grasse.
2084   <S {Boy}.> They say that they haue measur'd many a mile,
2085   To tread a Measure with you on this grasse.
2086   <S {Rosa}.> It is not so. Aske them how many inches
2087   Is in one mile? If they haue measur'd manie,
2088   The measure then of one is easlie told.
2089   <S {Boy}.> If to come hither, you haue measur'd miles,
2090   And many miles: the Princesse bids you tell,
2091   How many inches doth fill vp one mile?
2092   <S {Ber}.> Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
2093   <S {Boy}.> She heares her selfe.
2094   <S {Rosa}.> How manie wearie steps,
2095   Of many wearie miles you haue ore- gone,
2096   Are numbred in the trauell of one mile?
2097   <S {Bero}.> We number nothing that we spend for you,
2098   Our dutie is so rich, so infinite,
2099   That we may doe it still without accompt.
2100   Vouchsafe to shew the sunshine of your face,
2101   That we (like sauages) may worship it.
2102   <S {Rosa}.> My face is but a Moone and clouded too.
2103   <S {Kin}.> Blessed are clouds, to doe as such clouds do.
2104   Vouchsafe bright Moone, and these thy stars to shine,
2105   (Those clouds remooued) vpon our waterie eyne.
2106   <S {Rosa}.> O vaine peticioner, beg a greater matter,
2107   Thou now requests but Mooneshine in the water.
2108  *<S {Kin}.> Then in our measure, vouchsafe but one change.
2109   Thou bidst me begge, this begging is not strange.
2110  *<S {Rosa}.> Play musicke then: nay you must doe it soone.
2111   Not yet no dance: thus change I like the Moone.
2112  *<S {Kin}.> Will you not dance? How come you thus e-stranged?
2113  _
2114  *<S {Rosa}.> You tooke the Moone at full, but now shee's
2115   changed?
2116   <S {Kin}.> Yet still she is the Moone, and I the Man.
2117  *<S {Rosa}.> The musick playes, vouchsafe some motion to
2118   it: Our eares vouchsafe it.
2119   <S {Kin}.> But your legges should doe it.
2120  *<S {Ros}.> Since you are strangers, & come here by chance,
2121   Wee'll not be nice, take hands, we will not dance.
2122   <S {Kin}.> Why take you hands then?
2123   <S {Rosa}.> Onelie to part friends.
2124   Curtsie sweet hearts, and so the Measure ends.
2125   <S {Kin}.> More measure of this measure, be not nice.
2126   <S {Rosa}.> We can afford no more at such a price.
2127  *<S {Kin}.> Prise your selues: What buyes your companie?
2128   <S {Rosa}.> Your absence onelie.
2129   <S {Kin}.> That can neuer be.
2130   <S {Rosa}.> Then cannot we be bought: and so adue,
2131   Twice to your Visore, and halfe once to you.
2132   <S {Kin}.> If you denie to dance, let's hold more chat.
2133   <S {Ros}.> In priuate then.
2134   <S {Kin}.> I am best pleas'd with that.
2135  *<S {Be}.> White handed Mistris, one sweet word with thee.
2136   <S {Qu}.> Hony, and Milke, and Suger: there is three.
2137   <S {Ber}.> Nay then two treyes, #an if you grow so nice
2138   Methegline, Wort, and Malmsey; well runne dice:
2139   There's halfe a dozen sweets.
2140   <S {Qu}.> Seuenth sweet adue, since you can cogg,
2141   Ile play no more with you.
2142   <S {Ber}.> One word in secret.
2143   <S {Qu}.> Let it not be sweet.
2144   <S {Ber}.> Thou greeu'st my gall.
      <P M4><C B>
2145   <S {Qu}.> Gall, bitter.
2146   <S {Ber}.> Therefore meete.
2147  *<S {Du}.> Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
2148   <S {Mar}.> Name it.
2149   <S {Dum}.> Faire Ladie:
2150   <S {Mar}.> Say you so? Faire Lord:
2151   Take you that for your faire Lady.
2152   <S {Du}.> Please it you,
2153   As much in priuate, and Ile bid adieu.
2154  *<S {Mar}.> What, was your vizard made without a tong?
2155   <S {Long}.> I know the reason Ladie why you aske.
2156   <S {Mar}.> O for your reason, quickly sir, I long.
2157  *<S {Long}.> You haue a double tongue within your mask,
2158   And would affoord my speechlesse vizard halfe.
2159  *<S {Mar}.> Veale quoth the Dutch- man: is not Veale a
2160   Calfe?
2161   <S {Long}.> A Calfe faire Ladie?
2162   <S {Mar}.> No, a faire Lord Calfe.
2163   <S {Long}.> Let's part the word.
2164   <S {Mar}.> No, Ile not be your halfe:
2165   Take all and weane it, it may proue an Oxe.
2166  *<S {Long}.> Looke how you #but your selfe in these sharpe
2167   mockes.
2168   Will you giue hornes chast Ladie? Do not so.
2169  *<S {Mar}.> Then die a Calfe before your horns do grow.
2170   <S {Lon}.> One word in priuate with you ere I die.
2171  *<S {Mar}.> Bleat softly then, the Butcher heares you cry.
2172  *<S {Boyet}.> The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
2173   As is the Razors edge, inuisible:
2174   Cutting a smaller haire then may be seene,
2175   Aboue the sense of sence so sensible:
2176   Seemeth their conference, their conceits haue wings,
2177  *Fleeter then arrows, bullets wind, thoght, swifter things
2178  *<S {Rosa}.> Not one word more my maides, breake off,
2179   breake off.
2180   <S {Ber}.> By heauen, all drie beaten with pure scoffe.
2181  *<S {King}.> Farewell madde Wenches, you haue simple
2182   wits.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2183   <S {Qu}.> Twentie adieus my frozen Muscouits.
2184   Are these the breed of wits so wondred at?
2185  *<S {Boyet}.> Tapers they are, with your sweete breathes
2186   puft out.
2187  *<S {Rosa}.> Wel- liking wits they haue, grosse, grosse, fat, fat.
2188   <S {Qu}.> O pouertie in wit, Kingly poore flout.
2189   Will they not (thinke you) hang themselues to night?
2190   Or euer but in vizards shew their faces:
2191   This pert {Berowne} was out of count'nance quite.
2192   <S {Rosa}.> They were all in lamentable cases.
2193   The King was weeping ripe for a good word.
2194   <S {Qu}.> {Berowne} did sweare himselfe out of all suite.
2195   <S {Mar}.> {Dumaine} was at my seruice, and his sword:
2196   No point (quoth I:) my seruant straight was mute.
2197   <S {Ka}.> Lord {Longauill} said I came ore his hart:
2198   And trow you what he call'd me?
2199   <S {Qu}.> Qualme perhaps.
2200   <S {Kat}.> Yes in good faith.
2201   <S {Qu}.> Go sicknesse as thou art.
2202  *<S {Ros}.> Well, better wits haue worne plain statute caps,
2203   But will you heare; the King is my loue sworne.
2204  *<S {Qu}.> And quicke {Berowne} hath plighted faith to me.
2205   <S {Kat}.> And {Longauill} was for my seruice borne.
2206   <S {Mar}.> {Dumaine} is mine as sure as barke on tree.
2207   <S {Boyet}.> Madam, and prettie mistresses giue eare,
2208   Immediately they will againe be heere
2209   In their owne shapes: for it can neuer be,
2210   They will digest this harsh indignitie.
2211   <S {Qu}.> Will they returne?
2212   <S {Boy}.> They will they will, God knowes,
2213   And leape for ioy, though they are lame with blowes:
2214   Therefore change Fauours, and when they repaire,
2215   Blow like sweet Roses, in this summer aire.
2216  *<S {Qu}.> How blow? how blow? Speake to bee vnder-stood.
2217  _
2218   <S {Boy}.> Faire Ladies maskt, are Roses in their bud:
2219   Dismaskt, their damaske sweet commixture showne,
2220   Are Angels vailing clouds, or Roses blowne.
2221   <S {Qu}.> Auant perplexitie: What shall we do,
2222   If they returne in their owne shapes to wo?
2223   <S {Rosa}.> Good Madam, if by me you'l be aduis'd.
2224   Let's mocke them still as well knowne as disguis'd:
2225   Let vs complaine to them what fooles were heare,
2226   Disguis'd like Muscouites in shapelesse geare:
2227   And wonder what they were, and to what end
2228   Their shallow showes, and Prologue vildely pen'd:
2229   And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
2230   Should be presented at our Tent to vs.
2231   <S {Boyet}.> Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
2232  *<S {Quee}.> Whip to our Tents, as Roes runnes ore Land.
2233   <D {Exeunt}.>
2234   <D {Enter the King and the rest}.>
2235  *<S {King}.> Faire sir, God saue you. Wher's the Princesse?
2236   <S {Boy}.> Gone to her Tent.
2237  *Please it your Maiestie command me any seruice to her?
2238  *<S {King}.> That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
2239   <S {Boy}.> I will, and so will she, I know my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
2240   <S {Ber}.> This fellow pickes vp wit as Pigeons pease,
2241   And vtters it againe, when {Ioue} doth please.
2242   He is Wits Pedler, and retailes his Wares,
2243   At Wakes, and Wassels, Meetings, Markets, Faires.
2244   And we that sell by grosse, the Lord doth know,
2245   Haue not the grace to grace it with such show.
2246   This Gallant pins the Wenches on his sleeue.
2247   Had he bin {Adam}, he had tempted {Eue}.
2248   He can carue too, and lispe: Why this is he,
2249   That kist away his hand in courtesie.
2250   This is the Ape of Forme, Monsieur the nice,
2251   That when he plaies at Tables, chides the Dice
2252   In honorable tearmes: Nay he can sing
2253   A meane most meanly, and in Vshering
2254   Mend him who can: the Ladies call him sweete.
2255   The staires as he treads on them kisse his feete.
2256   This is the flower that smiles on euerie one,
2257   To shew his teeth as white as Whales bone.
2258   And consciences that wil not die in debt,
2259   Pay him the dutie of honie- tongued {Boyet}.
2260   <S {King}.> A blister on his sweet tongue with my hart,
2261   That put {Armathoes} Page out of his part.
2262   <D {Enter the Ladies}.>
2263  *<S {Ber}.> See where it comes. Behauiour what wer't thou,
2264  *Till this madman shew'd thee? And what art thou now?
2265   <S {King}.> All haile sweet Madame, and faire time of day.
2266   <S {Qu}.> Faire in all Haile is foule, as I conceiue.
2267   <S {King}.> Construe my speeches better, if you may.
2268   <S {Qu}.> Then wish me better, I wil giue you leaue.
2269   <S {King}.> We came to visit you, and purpose now
2270   To leade you to our Court, vouchsafe it then.
2271  *<S {Qu}.> This field shal hold me, and so hold your vow:
2272   Nor God, nor I, delights in periur'd men.
2273   <S {King}.> Rebuke me not for that which you prouoke:
      <P M4v>
2274   The vertue of your eie must breake my oth.
2275  *<S {Q}.> You nickname vertue: vice you should haue spoke:
2276   For vertues office neuer breakes men troth.
2277   Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure
2278   As the vnsallied Lilly, I protest,
2279   A world of torments though I should endure,
2280   I would not yeeld to be your houses guest:
2281   So much I hate a breaking cause to be
2282   Of heauenly oaths, vow'd with integritie.
2283   <S {Kin}.> O you haue liu'd in desolation heere,
2284   Vnseene, vnuisited, much to our shame.
2285   <S {Qu}.> Not so my Lord, it is not so I sweare,
2286   We haue had pastimes heere, and pleasant game,
2287   A messe of Russians left vs but of late.
2288   <S {Kin}.> How Madam? Russians?
2289   <S {Qu}.> #I in truth, my Lord.
2290   Trim gallants, full of Courtship and of state.
2291   <S {Rosa}.> Madam speake true. It is not so my Lord:
2292   My Ladie (to the manner of the daies)
2293   In curtesie giues vndeseruing praise.
2294   We foure indeed confronted were with foure
2295   In Russia habit: Heere they stayed an houre,
2296   And talk'd apace: and in that houre (my Lord)
2297   They did not blesse vs with one happy word.
2298   I dare not call them fooles; but this I thinke,
2299  *When they are thirstie, fooles would faine haue drinke.
2300   <S {Ber}.> This iest is drie to me. Gentle sweete,
2301   Your wits makes wise things foolish when we greete
2302   With eies best seeing, heauens fierie eie:
2303   By light we loose light; your capacitie
2304   Is of that nature, that to your huge stoore,
2305   Wise things seeme foolish, and rich things but poore.
2306   <S {Ros}.> This proues you wise and rich: for in my eie
2307   <S {Ber}.> I am a foole, and full of pouertie.
2308   <S {Ros}.> But that you take what doth to you belong,
2309   It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
2310   <S {Ber}.> O, I am yours, and all that I possesse.
2311   <S {Ros}.> All the foole mine.
2312   <S {Ber}.> I cannot giue you lesse.
2313   <S {Ros}.> Which of the Vizards what it that you wore?
2314   <S {Ber}.> Where? when? What Vizard?
2315   Why demand you this?
2316  *<S {Ros}.> There, then, that vizard, that superfluous case,
2317   That hid the worse, and shew'd the better face.
2318   <S {Kin}.> We are discried,
2319   They'l mocke vs now downeright.
2320   <S {Du}.> Let vs confesse, and turne it to a iest.
2321  *<S {Que}.> Amaz'd my Lord? Why lookes your Highnes
2322   sadde?
2323  *<S {Rosa}.> Helpe hold his browes, hee'l sound: why looke
2324   you pale?
2325   Sea- sicke I thinke comming from Muscouie.
2326  *<S {Ber}.> Thus poure the stars down plagues for periury.
2327   Can any face of brasse hold longer out?
2328   Heere stand I, Ladie dart thy skill at me,
2329   Bruise me with scorne, confound me with a flout.
2330   Thrust thy sharpe wit quite through my ignorance.
2331   Cut me to peeces with thy keene conceit:
2332   And I will wish thee neuer more to dance,
2333   Nor neuer more in Russian habit waite.
2334   O! neuer will I trust to speeches pen'd,
2335   Nor to the motion of a Schoole- boies tongue.
2336   Nor neuer come in vizard to my friend,
2337   Nor woo in rime like a blind- harpers songue,
2338   Taffata phrases, silken tearmes precise,
2339   Three- pil'd Hyperboles, spruce affection;
2340   Figures pedanticall, these summer flies,
2341   Haue blowne me full of maggot ostentation.
2342   I do forsweare them, and I heere protest,
2343  *By this white Gloue (how white the hand God knows)
2344   Henceforth my woing minde   shall be exprest
2345   In russet yeas, and honest kersie noes.
2346   And to begin Wench, so God helpe me law,
2347   My loue to thee is sound, {sans} cracke or flaw,
2348   <S {Rosa}.> {Sans, sans}, I pray you.
2349   <S {Ber}.> Yet I haue a tricke
2350   Of the old rage: beare with me, I am sicke.
2351   Ile leaue it by degrees: soft, let vs see,
2352   Write {Lord haue mercie on vs}, on those three,
2353   They are infected, in their hearts it lies:
2354   They haue the plague, and caught it of your eyes:
2355   These Lords are visited, you are not free:
2356   For the Lords tokens on you do I see.
2357   <S {Qu}.> No, they are free that gaue these tokens to vs.
2358   <S {Ber}.> Our states are forfeit, seeke not to vndo vs.
2359   <S {Ros}.> It is not so; for how can this be true,
2360   That you stand forfeit, being those that sue.
2361   <S {Ber}.> Peace, for I will not haue to do with you.
2362   <S {Ros}.> Nor shall  not, if I do as I intend.
2363   <S {Ber}.> Speake for your selues, my wit is at an end.
2364  *<S {King}.> Teach vs sweete Madame, for our rude trans-gression,
2365   some faire excuse.
2366   <S {Qu}.> The fairest is confession.
2367   Were you not heere but euen now, disguis'd?
2368   <S {Kin}.> Madam, I was.
2369   <S {Qu}.> And were you well aduis'd?
2370   <S {Kin}.> I was faire Madam.
2371   <S {Qu}.> When you then were heere,
2372   What did you whisper in your Ladies eare?
2373  *<S {King}.> That more then all the world I did respect her
2374  *<S {Qu}.> When shee shall challenge this, you will reiect
2375   her.
2376   <S {King}.> Vpon mine Honor no.
2377   <S {Qu}.> Peace, peace, forbeare:
2378   Your oath once broke, you force not to forsweare.
2379   <S {King}.> Despise me when I breake this oath of mine.
2380   <S {Qu}.> I will, and therefore keepe it. {Rosaline},
2381   What did the Russian whisper in your eare?
2382   <S {Ros}.> Madam, he swore that he did hold me deare
2383   As precious eye- sight, and did value me
2384   Aboue this World: adding thereto moreouer,
2385   That he would Wed me, or else die my Louer.
2386   <S {Qu}.> God giue thee ioy of him: the Noble Lord
2387   Most honorably doth vphold his word.
2388   <S {King}.> What meane you Madame?
2389   By my life, my troth
2390   I neuer swore this Ladie such an oth.
2391   <S {Ros}.> By heauen you did; and to confirme it plaine,
2392   You gaue me this: But take it sir againe.
2393   <S {King}.> My faith and this, the Princesse I did giue,
2394   I knew her by this Iewell on her sleeue.
2395   <S {Qu}.> Pardon me sir, this Iewell did she weare.
2396   And Lord {Berowne} (I thanke him) is my deare.
2397   What? Will you haue me, or your Pearle againe?
2398   <S {Ber}.> Neither of either, I remit both twaine.
2399   I see the tricke on't: Heere was a consent,
2400   Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
2401   To dash it like a Christmas Comedie.
2402   Some carry- tale, some please- man, some slight Zanie,
2403  *Some mumble- newes, some trencher- knight, som Dick
2404   That smiles his cheeke in yeares, and knowes the trick
2405   To make my Lady laugh, when she's dispos'd;
      <P M5>
2406   Told our intents before: which once disclos'd,
2407   The Ladies did change Fauours; and then we
2408   Following the signes, woo'd but the signe of #she.
2409   Now to our periurie, to adde more terror,
2410   We are againe forsworne in #will and error.
2411   Much vpon this tis: and might not you
2412   Forestall our sport, to make vs thus vntrue?
2413   Do not you know my Ladies foot by'th squier?
2414   And laugh vpon the apple of her eie?
2415   And stand betweene her backe sir, and the fire,
2416   Holding a trencher, iesting merrilie?
2417   You put our Page out: go, you are alowd.
2418   Die when you will, a smocke shall be your shrowd.
2419   You leere vpon me, do you? There's an eie
2420   Wounds like a Leaden sword.
2421  *<S {Boy}.> Full merrily hath this braue manager, this car-reere
2422   bene run.
2423   <S {Ber}.> Loe, he is tilting straight. Peace, I haue don.
2424   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
2425   Welcome pure wit, thou part'st a faire fray.
2426   <S {Clo}.> O Lord sir, they would kno,
2427   Whether the three worthies shall come in, or no.
2428   <S {Ber}.> What, are there but three?
2429   <S {Clo}.> No sir, but it is vara fine,
2430   For euerie one pursents three.
2431   <S {Ber}.> And three times thrice is nine.
2432  *<S {Clo}.> Not so sir, vnder correction sir, I hope it is not so.
2433  *You cannot beg vs sir, I can assure you sir, we know what
2434   we know: I hope sir three times thrice sir.
2435   <S {Ber}.> Is not nine.
2436  *<S {Clo}.> Vnder correction sir, wee know where- vntill it
2437   doth amount.
2438   <S {Ber}.> By Ioue,   I alwaies tooke three threes for nine.
2439  *<S {Clow}.> O Lord sir, it were pittie you should get your
2440   liuing by reckning sir.
2441   <S {Ber}.> How much is it?
2442  *<S {Clo}.> O Lord sir, the parties themselues, the actors sir
2443  *will shew where- vntill it doth amount: for mine owne
2444  *part, I am (as they say, but to perfect one man in one
2445   poore man) {Pompion} the great sir.
2446   <S {Ber}.> Art thou one of the Worthies?
2447  *<S {Clo}.> It pleased them to thinke me worthie of {Pompey}
2448  *the great: for mine owne part, I know not the degree of
2449   the Worthie, but I am to stand for him.
2450   <S {Ber}.> Go, bid them prepare.  <D {Exit}.>
2451  *<S {Clo}.> We will turne it finely off sir, we wil take some
2452   care.
2453   <S {King}.> {Berowne}, they will shame vs:
2454   Let them not approach.
2455  *<S {Ber}.> We are shame- proofe my Lord: and 'tis some
2456  *policie, to haue one shew worse then the Kings and his
2457   companie.
2458   <S {Kin}.> I say they shall not come.
2459   <S {Qu}.> Nay my good Lord, let me ore- rule you now;
2460   That sport best pleases, that doth least know how.
2461   Where Zeale striues to content, and the contents
2462   Dies in the Zeale of that which it presents:
2463   Their forme confounded, makes most forme in mirth,
2464   When great things labouring perish in their birth.
2465   <S {Ber}.> A right description of our sport my Lord.
2466   <D {Enter Braggart}.>
2467   <S {Brag}.> Annointed, I implore so much expence of thy
2468   royall sweet breath, as will vtter a brace of words.
2469   <S {Qu}.> Doth this man serue God?
2470   <S {Ber}.> Why aske you?
2471   <S {Qu}.> He speak's not like a man of God's making.
2472  *<S {Brag}.> That's all one my faire sweet honie Monarch:
2473  *For I protest, the Schoolmaster is exceeding fantasticall:
2474  *Too too vaine, too too vaine. But we wil put it (as they
2475  *say) to {Fortuna delaguar}, I wish you the peace of minde
2476   most royall cupplement.
2477  *<S {King}.> Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies;
2478  *He presents {Hector} of Troy, the Swaine {Pompey} y great,
2479  *the Parish Curate {Alexander, Armadoes} Page {Hercules},
2480  *the Pedant {Iudas Machabeus}: and if these foure Wor-thies
2481  *in their first shew thriue, these foure will change
2482   habites, and present the other fiue.
2483   <S {Ber}.> There is fiue in the first shew.
2484   <S {Kin}.> You are deceiued, tis not so.
2485  *<S {Ber}.> The Pedant, the Braggart, the Hedge- Priest, the
2486   Foole, and the Boy,
2487   Abate throw at Novum, and the whole world againe,
2488   Cannot pricke out fiue such, take each one in's vaine.
2489  *<S {Kin}.> The ship is vnder saile, and here she coms amain.
2490   <D {Enter Pompey}.>
2491   <S {Clo}.> {I Pompey am}.
2492   <S {Ber}.> You lie, you are not he.
2493   <S {Clo}.> {I Pompey am}.
2494   <S {Boy}.> With Libbards head on knee.
2495   <S {Ber}.> Well said old mocker,
2496   I must needs be friends with thee.
2497   <S {Clo}.> {I Pompey am, Pompey surnam'd the big}.
2498   <S {Du}.> The great.
2499   <S {Clo}.> It is great sir: {Pompey surnam'd the great}:
2500   {That oft in field, with Targe and Shield},
2501   {did make my foe to sweat}:
2502  *{And trauailing along this coast, I heere am come by chance},
2503   {And lay my Armes before the legs of this sweet Lasse of}
2504   {France}.
2505  *If your Ladiship would say thankes {Pompey}, I had done.
2506   <S {La}.> Great thankes great {Pompey}.
2507  *<S {Clo}.> Tis not so much worth: but I hope I was per-fect.
2508   I made a little fault in great.
2509  *<S {Ber}.> My hat to a halfe- penie, Pompey prooues the
2510   best Worthie.
2511   <D {Enter Curate for Alexander}.>
2512  *<S {Curat}.> {When in the world I liu'd, I was the worldes Com-mander}:
2513  _
2514  *{By East, West, North, & South, I spred my conquering #might}
2515   {My Scutcheon plaine declares that I am Alisander}.
2516   <S {Boiet}.> Your nose saies #no, you are not:
2517   For it stands too right.
2518  *<S {Ber}.> Your nose smells #no, in this most tender smel-ling
2519   Knight.
2520   <S {Qu}.> The Conqueror is dismaid:
2521   Proceede good {Alexander}.
2522  *<S {Cur}.> {When in the world I liued, I was the worldes Com-mander}.
2523  _
2524   <S {Boiet}.> Most true, 'tis right; you were so {Alisander}.
2525   <S {Ber}.> Pompey the great.
2526   <S {Clo}.> your seruant and {Costard}.
2527  *<S {Ber}.> Take away the Conqueror, take away {Alisander}
2528  *<S {Clo}.> O sir, you haue ouerthrowne {Alisander} the con-queror:
2529  *you will be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for
      <P M5v>
2530  *this: your Lion that holds his Pollax sitting on a close
2531  *stoole, will be giuen to Aiax. He will be the ninth wor-thie.
2532  *A Conqueror, and affraid to speake? Runne away
2533  *for shame {Alisander}. There an't shall please you: a foo-lish
2534  *milde man, an honest man, looke you, & soon dasht.
2535  *He is a maruellous good neighbour insooth, and a verie
2536  *good Bowler: but for {Alisander}, alas you see, how 'tis a
2537  *little ore- parted. But there are Worthies #a comming,
2538   will speake their minde in some other sort.  <D {Exit Cu}.>
2539   <S {Qu}.> Stand aside good Pompey.
2540   <D {Enter Pedant for Iudas, and the Boy for Hercules}.>
2541   <S {Ped}.> Great {Hercules} is presented by this Impe,
2542   Whose Club kil'd {Cerberus} that three- headed {Canus},
2543   And when he was a babe, a childe, a shrimpe,
2544   Thus did he strangle Serpents in his {Manus}:
2545   {Quoniam}, he seemeth in minoritie,
2546   {Ergo}, I come with this Apologie.
2547   Keepe some state in thy {#exit}, and vanish.  <D {Exit Boy}>
2548   <S {Ped}.> Iudas {I am}.
2549   <S {Dum}.> A Iudas?
2550   <S {Ped}.> {Not Iscariot sir}.
2551   {Iudas I am, ycliped Machabeus}.
2552   <S {Dum}.> {Iudas Machabeus} clipt, is plaine Iudas.
2553   <S {Ber}.> A kissing traitor. How art thou prou'd {Iudas}?
2554   <S {Ped}.> {Iudas I am}.
2555   <S {Dum}.> The more shame for you {Iudas}.
2556   <S {Ped}.> What meane you sir?
2557   <S {Boi}.> To make {Iudas} hang himselfe.
2558   <S {Ped}.> Begin sir, you are my elder.
2559   <S {Ber}.> Well follow'd, {Iudas} was hang'd on an Elder.
2560   <S {Ped}.> I will not be put out of countenance.
2561   <S {Ber}.> Because thou hast no face.
2562   <S {Ped}.> What is this?
2563   <S {Boi}.> A Citterne head.
2564   <S {Dum}.> The head of a bodkin.
2565   <S {Ber}.> A deaths face in a ring.
2566   <S {Lon}.> The face of an old Roman coine, scarce seene.
2567   <S {Boi}.> The pummell of {Caesars} Faulchion.
2568   <S {Dum}.> The caru'd- bone face on a Flaske.
2569   <S {Ber}.> S[aint]. Georges halfe cheeke in a brooch.
2570   <S {Dum}.> #I, and in a brooch of Lead.
2571   <S {Ber}.> #I, and worne in the cap of a Tooth- drawer.
2572  *And now forward, for we haue put thee in countenance
2573   <S {Ped}.> You haue put me out of countenance.
2574   <S {Ber}.> False, we haue giuen thee faces.
2575   <S {Ped}.> But you haue out- fac'd them all.
2576   <S {Ber}.> #And thou wer't a Lion, we would do so.
2577   <S {Boy}.> Therefore as he is, an Asse, let him go:
2578   And so adieu sweet {Iude}. Nay, why dost thou stay?
2579   <S {Dum}.> For the latter end of his name.
2580  *<S {Ber}.> For the {Asse} to the {Iude}: giue it him. {Iud-as} a-way.
2581  _
2582   <S {Ped}.> This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
2583  *<S {Boy}.> A light for monsieur {Iudas}, it growes darke, he
2584   may stumble.
2585  *<S {Que}.> Alas poore {Machabeus}, how hath hee beene
2586   baited.
2587   <D {Enter Braggart}.>
2588  *<S {Ber}.> Hide thy head {Achilles}, heere comes {Hector} in
2589   Armes.
2590  *<S {Dum}.> Though my mockes come home by me, I will
2591   now be merrie.
2592   <S {King}.> {Hector} was but a Troyan in respect of this.
2593   <S {Boi}.> But is this {Hector}?
2594   <S {Kin}.> I thinke {Hector} was not so cleane timber'd.
2595   <S {Lon}.> His legge is too big for {Hector}.
2596   <S {Dum}.> More Calfe certaine.
2597   <S {Boi}.> No, he is best indued in the small.
2598   <S {Ber}.> This cannot be {Hector}.
2599   <S {Dum}.> He's a God or a Painter, for he makes faces.
2600  *<S {Brag}.> {The Armipotent Mars, of Launces the almighty},
2601   {gaue} Hector {a gift}.
2602   <S {Dum}.> A gilt Nutmegge.
2603   <S {Ber}.> A Lemmon.
2604   <S {Lon}.> Stucke with Cloues.
2605   <S {Dum}.> No clouen.
2606  *<S {Brag}.> {The Armipotent Mars of Launces the almighty},
2607   {Gaue Hector a gift, the heire of Illion;}
2608   {A man so breathed, that certaine he would fight: yea}
2609   {From morne till night, out of his Pauillion}.
2610   I am that Flower.
2611   <S {Dum}.> That Mint.
2612   <S {Long}.> That Cullambine.
2613   <S {Brag}.> Sweet Lord {Longauill} reine thy tongue.
2614  *<S {Lon}.> I must rather giue it the reine: for it runnes a-gainst
2615   {Hector}.
2616   <S {Dum}.> #I, and {Hector}'s a Grey- hound.
2617   <S {Brag}.> The sweet War- man is dead and rotten,
2618   Sweet chuckes, beat not the bones of the buried:
2619   But I will forward with my deuice;
2620   Sweete Royaltie bestow on me the sence of hearing.
2621   <D {#Berowne steppes forth}.>
2622   <S {Qu}.> Speake braue Hector, we are much delighted.
2623   <S {Brag}.> i do adore thy sweet Graces slipper.
2624   <S {Boy}.> Loues her by the foot.
2625   <S {Dum}.> He may not by the yard.
2626   <S {Brag}.> {This Hector farre surmounted Hanniball}.
2627   {The partie is gone}.
2628  *<S {Clo}.> Fellow {Hector}, she is gone; she is two moneths
2629   on her way.
2630   <S {Brag}.> What meanest thou?
2631  *<S {Clo}.> Faith vnlesse you play the honest Troyan, the
2632  *poore Wench is cast away: she's quick, the child brags
2633   in her belly alreadie: tis yours.
2634  *<S {Brag}.> Dost thou infamonize me among Potentates?
2635   Thou shalt die.
2636  *<S {Clo}.> Then shall Hector be whipt for {Iaquenetta} that
2637  *is quicke by him, and hang'd for {Pompey}, that is dead by
2638   him.
2639   <S {Dum}.> Most rare {Pompey}.
2640   <S {Boi}.> Renowned {Pompey}.
2641  *<S {Ber}.> Greater then great, great, great, great {Pompey}:
2642   {Pompey} the huge.
2643   <S {Dum}.> Hector trembles.
2644  *<S {Ber}.> {Pompey} is moued, more Atees more Atees stirre
2645   them, or stirre them on.
2646   <S {Dum}.> Hector will challenge him.
2647  *<S {Ber}.> #I, if a'haue no more mans blood in's belly, then
2648   will sup a Flea.
2649   <S {Brag}.> By the North- pole I do challenge thee.
2650  *<S {Clo}.> I wil not fight with a pole like a Northern man;
2651  *Ile slash, Ile do it by the sword: I pray you let mee bor-row
2652   my Armes againe.
2653   <S {Dum}.> Roome for the incensed Worthies.
2654   <S {Clo}.> Ile do it in my shirt.
2655   <S {Dum}.> Most resolute {Pompey}.
2656  *<S {Page}.> Master, let me take you a button hole lower:
2657  *Do you not see {Pompey} is vncasing for the combat: what
      <P M6>
2658   meane you? you will lose your reputation.
2659  *<S {Brag}.> Gentlemen and Souldiers pardon me, I will
2660   not combat in my shirt.
2661  *<S {Du}.> You may not denie it, {Pompey} hath made the
2662   challenge.
2663   <S {Brag}.> Sweet bloods, I both may, and will.
2664   <S {Ber}.> What reason haue you for't?
2665   <S {Brag}.> The naked truth of it is, I haue no shirt,
2666   I go woolward for penance.
2667  *<S {Boy}.> True, and it was inioyned him in {Rome} for want
2668  *of Linnen: since when, Ile be sworne he wore none, but
2669  *a dishclout of {Iaquenettas}, and that hee weares next his
2670   heart for a fauour.
2671   <D {Enter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcade}.>
2672   <S {Mar}.> God saue you Madame.
2673  *<S {Qu}.> Welcome {Marcade}, but that thou interruptest
2674   our merriment.
2675  *<S {Marc}.> I am sorrie Madam, for the newes I bring is
2676   heauie in my tongue. The King your father
2677   <S {Qu}.> Dead for my life.
2678   <S {Mar}.> Euen so: My tale is told.
2679   <S {Ber}.> Worthies away, the Scene begins to cloud.
2680  *<S {Brag}.> For mine owne part, I breath free breath: I
2681  *haue seene the day of wrong, through the little hole of
2682   discretion, and I will right my selfe like a Souldier.
2683   <D {Exeunt Worthies}>
2684   <S {Kin}.> How fare's your Maiestie?
2685   <S {Qu}.> {Boyet} prepare, I will away to night.
2686   <S {Kin}.> Madame not so, I do beseech you stay.
2687   <S {Qu}.> Prepare I say. I thanke you gracious Lords
2688   For all your faire endeuours and entreats:
2689   Out of a new sad- soule, that you vouchsafe,
2690   In your rich wisedome to excuse, or hide,
2691   The liberall opposition of our spirits,
2692   If ouer- boldly we haue borne our selues,
2693   In the conuerse of breath (your gentlenesse
2694   Was guiltie of it.) Farewell worthie Lord:
2695   A heauie heart beares not a humble tongue.
2696   Excuse me so, comming so short of thankes,
2697   For my great suite, so easily obtain'd.
2698   <S {Kin}.> The extreme parts of time, extremelie formes
2699   All causes to the purpose of his speed:
2700   And often at his verie loose decides
2701   That, which long processe could not arbitrate.
2702   And though the mourning brow of progenie
2703   Forbid the smiling curtesie of Loue:
2704   The holy suite which faine it would conuince,
2705   Yet since loues argument was first on foote,
2706   Let not the cloud of sorrow iustle it
2707   From what it purpos'd: since to waile friends lost,
2708   Is not by much so wholsome profitable,
2709   As to reioyce at friends but newly found.
2710   <S {Qu}.> I vnderstand you not, my greefes are double.
2711  *<S {Ber}.> Honest plain words, best pierce the ears of griefe
2712   And by these badges vnderstand the King,
2713   For your faire sakes haue we neglected time,
2714   Plaid foule play with our oaths: your beautie Ladies
2715   Hath much deformed vs, fashioning our humors
2716   Euen to the opposed end of our intents.
2717   And what in vs hath seem'd ridiculous:
2718   As Loue is full of vnbefitting straines,
2719   All wanton as a childe, skipping and vaine.
2720   Form'd by the eie, and therefore like the eie.
2721   Full of straying shapes, of habits, and of formes
2722   Varying in subiects as the eie doth roule,
2723   To euerie varied obiect in his glance:
2724   Which partie- coated presence of loose loue
2725   Put on by vs, if in your heauenly eies,
2726   Haue misbecom'd our oathes and grauities.
2727   Those heauenlie eies that looke into these faults,
2728   Suggested vs to make: therefore Ladies
2729   Our loue being yours, the error that Loue makes
2730   Is likewise yours. We to our selues proue false,
2731   By being once false, for euer to be true
2732   To those that make vs both, faire Ladies you.
2733   And euen that falshood in it selfe a sinne,
2734   Thus purifies it selfe, and turnes to grace.
2735   <S {Qu}.> We haue receiu'd your Letters, full of Loue:
2736   Your Fauours, the Ambassadors of Loue.
2737   And in our maiden counsaile rated them,
2738   At courtship, pleasant iest, and curtesie,
2739   As bumbast and as lining to the time:
2740   But more deuout then these are our respects
2741   Haue we not bene, and therefore met your loues
2742   In their owne fashion, like a merriment.
2743  *<S {Du}.> Our letters Madam, shew'd much more then iest.
2744   <S {Lon}.> So did our lookes.
2745   <S {Rosa}.> We did not coat them so.
2746   <S {Kin}.> Now at the latest minute of the houre,
2747   Grant vs your loues.
2748   <S {Qu}.> A time me thinkes too short,
2749   To make a world- without- end bargaine in:
2750   No, no my Lord, your Grace is periur'd much,
2751   Full of deare guiltinesse, and therefore this:
2752   If for my Loue (as there is no such cause)
2753   You will do ought, this shall you do for me.
2754   Your oth I will not trust: but go with speed
2755   To some forlorne and naked Hermitage,
2756   Remote from all the pleasures of the world:
2757   There stay, vntill the twelue Celestiall Signes
2758   Haue brought about their annuall reckoning.
2759   If this austere insociable life,
2760   Change not your offer made in heate of blood:
2761   If frosts, and fasts, hard lodging, and thin weeds
2762   Nip not the gaudie blossomes of your Loue,
2763   But that it beare this triall, and last loue:
2764   Then at the expiration of the yeare,
2765   Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
2766   And by this Virgin palme, now kissing thine,
2767   I will be thine: and till that instant shut
2768   My wofull selfe vp in a mourning house,
2769   Raining the teares of lamentation,
2770   For the remembrance of my Fathers death.
2771   If this thou do denie, let our hands part,
2772   Neither intitled in the others hart.
2773   <S {Kin}.> If this, or more then this, I would denie,
2774   To flatter vp these powers of mine with rest,
2775   The sodaine hand of death close vp mine eie.
2776   Hence euer then, my heart is in thy brest.
2777   <S {Ber}.> And what to me my Loue? and what to me?
2778   <S {Ros}.> You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd.
2779   You are attaint with faults and periurie:
2780   Therefore if you my fauor meane to get,
2781   A tweluemonth shall you spend, and neuer rest,
2782   But seeke the wearie beds of people sicke.
2783   <S {Du}.> But what to me my loue? but what to me?
2784   <S {Kat}.> A wife? a beard, faire health, and honestie,
2785   With three- fold loue, I wish you all these three.
2786   <S {Du}.> O shall I say, I thanke you gentle wife?
2787   <S {Kat}.> Not so my Lord, a tweluemonth and a day,
      <P M6v>
2788   Ile marke no words that smoothfac'd wooers say.
2789   Come when the King doth to my Ladie come:
2790   Then if I haue much loue, Ile giue you some.
2791   <S {Dum}.> Ile serue thee true and faithfully till then.
2792   <S {Kath}.> Yet sweare not, least ye be forsworne agen.
2793   <S {Lon}.> What saies {Maria}?
2794   <S {Mari}.> At the tweluemonths end,
2795   Ile change my blacke Gowne, for a faithfull friend.
2796   <S {Lon}.> Ile stay with patience: but the time is long.
2797   <S {Mari}.> The liker you, few taller are so yong.
2798   <S {Ber}.> Studies my Ladie? Mistresse, looke on me,
2799   Behold the window of my heart, mine eie:
2800   What humble suite attends thy answer there,
2801   Impose some seruice on me for my loue.
2802   <S {Ros}.> Oft haue I heard of you my Lord {Berowne},
2803   Before I saw you: and the worlds large tongue
2804   Proclaimes you for a man repleate with mockes,
2805   Full of comparisons, and wounding floutes:
2806   Which you on all estates will execute,
2807   That lie within the mercie of your wit.
2808   To  weed this Wormewood from your fruitfull braine,
2809   And therewithall to win me, if you please,
2810   Without the which I am not to be won:
2811   You shall this tweluemonth terme from day to day,
2812   Visit the speechlesse sicke, and still conuerse
2813   With groaning wretches: and your taske shall be,
2814   With all the fierce endeuour of your wit,
2815   To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
2816  *<S {Ber}.> To moue wilde laughter in the throate of death?
2817   It cannot be, it is impossible.
2818   Mirth cannot moue a soule in agonie.
2819   <S {Ros}.> Why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
2820   Whose influence is begot of that loose grace,
2821   Which shallow laughing hearers giue to fooles:
2822   A iests prosperitie, lies in the eare
2823   Of him that heares it, neuer in the tongue
2824   Of him that makes it: then, if sickly eares,
2825   Deaft with the clamors of their owne deare grones,
2826   Will heare your idle scornes; continue then,
2827   And I will haue you, and that fault withall.
2828   But if they will  not, throw away that spirit,
2829   And I shal finde you emptie of that fault,
2830   Right ioyfull of your reformation.
2831  *<S {Ber}.> A tweluemonth? Well: befall what will befall,
2832   Ile iest a tweluemonth in an Hospitall.
2833   <S {Qu}.> #I sweet my Lord, and so I take my leaue.
2834   <S {King}.> No Madam, we will bring you on your way.
2835   <S {Ber}.> Our woing doth not end like an old Play:
2836   Iacke hath not Gill: these Ladies courtesie
2837   Might wel haue made our sport a Comedie.
2838   <S {Kin}.> Come sir, it wants a tweluemonth and a day,
2839   And then 'twil end.
2840   <S {Ber}.> That's too long for a play.
2841   <D {Enter Braggart}.>
2842   <S {Brag}.> Sweet Maiesty vouchsafe me.
2843   <S {Qu}.> Was not that Hector?
2844   <S {Dum}.> The worthie Knight of Troy.
2845   <S {Brag}.> I wil kisse thy royal finger, and take leaue.
2846  *I am a Votarie, I haue vow'd to {Iaquenetta} to holde the
2847  *Plough for her sweet loue three yeares. But most estee-med
2848  *greatnesse, wil you heare the Dialogue that the two
2849  *Learned men haue compiled, in praise of the Owle and
2850  *the Cuckow? It should haue followed in the end of our
2851   shew.
2852   <S {Kin}.> Call them forth quickely, we will do so.
2853   <S {Brag}.> Holla, Approach.
2854   <D {Enter all}.>
2855   This side is {Hiems}, Winter.
2856   This {Ver}, the Spring: the one maintained by the Owle,
2857   Th' other by the Cuckow.
2858   {Ver}, begin.
2859   <D {The Song}.>
2860   When Dasies pied, and Violets blew,
2861   And Cuckow- buds of yellow hew:
2862   And Ladie- smockes all siluer white,
2863   Do paint the Medowes with delight.
2864   The Cuckow then on euerie tree,
2865   Mockes married men, for thus sings he,
2866   Cuckow.
2867   Cuckow, Cuckow: O word of feare,
2868   Vnpleasing to a married eare.
2869   When Shepheards pipe on Oaten strawes,
2870   And merrie Larkes are Ploughmens clockes:
2871   When Turtles tread, and Rookes and Dawes,
2872   And Maidens bleach their summer smockes:
2873   The Cuckow then on euerie tree
2874   Mockes married men; for thus sings he,
2875   Cuckow.
2876   Cuckow, Cuckow: O word of feare,
2877   Vnpleasing to a married eare.
2878   <S {Winter}.>
2879   When Isicles hang by the wall,
2880   And Dicke the Shepheard blowes his naile;
2881   And Tom beares Logges into the hall,
2882   And Milke comes frozen home in paile:
2883   When blood is nipt, and waies be fowle,
2884   Then nightly sings the staring Owle
2885   Tu-whit to-who.
2886   A merrie note,
2887   While greasie Ione   doth keele the pot.
2888   When all aloud the winde doth blow,
2889   And coffing drownes the Parsons saw:
2890   And birds sit brooding in the snow,
2891   And Marrians nose lookes red and raw:
2892   When roasted Crabs hisse in the bowle,
2893   Then nightly sings the staring Owle,
2894   Tu-whit to-who:
2895   A merrie note,
2896   While greasie Ione   doth keele the pot.
2897   <S {Brag}.> The Words of Mercurie,
2898   Are harsh after the songs of Apollo:
2899   You that way; we this way.
2900   <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
2901   <Z FINIS.
2902   Loues Labour's lost.>
