4      <S 1. {Citizen}.>
5     *Before we proceed any further, heare me speake.
6      <S {All}.> Speake, speake.
7     *<S 1.{Cit}.> You are all resolu'd rather to dy then
8      to famish?
9      <S {All}.> Resolu'd, resolu'd.
10    *<S 1.{Cit}.> First you know, {Caius Martius} is chiefe enemy
11     to the people.
12     <S {All}.> We know't, we know't.
13    *<S 1.{Cit}.> Let vs kill him, and wee'l haue Corne at our own
14     price. Is't a Verdict?
15    *<S {All}.> No more talking on't; Let it be done, away, away
16     <S 2.{Cit}.> One word, good Citizens.
17    *<S 1.{Cit}.> We are accounted poore Citizens, the Patri-cians
18    *good: what Authority surfets one, would releeue
19    *vs. If they would yeelde vs but the superfluitie while it
20    *were wholsome, wee might guesse they releeued vs hu-manely:
21    *But they thinke we are too deere, the leannesse
22    *that afflicts vs, the obiect of our misery, is as an inuento-ry
23    *to particularize their abundance, our sufferance is a
24    *gaine to them. Let vs reuenge this with our Pikes, ere
25    *we become Rakes. For the Gods know, I speake this in
26     hunger for Bread, not in thirst for Reuenge.
27    *<S 2.{Cit}.> Would you proceede especially against {Caius}
28     {#Martius}.
29    *<S {All}.> Against him first: He's a very dog to the Com-monalty.
30    _
31    *<S 2.{Cit}.> Consider you what Seruices he ha's done for his
32     Country?
33    *<S 1.{Cit}.> Very well, and could bee content to giue him
34    *good report for't, but that hee payes himselfe with bee-ing
35     proud.
36     <S {All}.> Nay, but speak not maliciously.
37    *<S 1.{Cit}.> I say vnto you, what he hath done Famouslie,
38    *he did it to that end: though soft conscienc'd men can be
39    *content to say it was for his Countrey, he did it to please
40    *his Mother, and to be partly proud, which he is, euen to
41     the altitude of his vertue.
42    *<S 2.{Cit}.> What he cannot helpe in his Nature, you ac-count
43    *a Vice in him: You must in no way say he is co-uetous.
44    _
45    *<S 1.{Cit}.> If I must not, I neede not be barren of Accusa-tions
46     he hath faults (with surplus) to tyre in repetition.
47     <D {Showts within}.>
48    *What showts are these? The other side a'th City is risen:
49     why stay we prating heere? To th' Capitoll.
50     <S {All}.> Come, come.
51     <S 1 {Cit}.> Soft, who comes heere?
52     <D {Enter Menenius Agrippa}.>
53    *<S 2 {Cit}.> Worthy {Menenius Agrippa}, one that hath al-wayes
54     lou'd the people.
55    *<S 1 {Cit}.> He's one honest enough, wold al the rest wer so.
56     <S {Men}.> What work's my Countrimen in hand?
57     Where go you with Bats and Clubs? The matter
58     Speake I pray you.
59    *<S 2 {Cit}.> Our busines is not vnknowne to th' Senat, they
60    *haue had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, w
61    *now wee'l shew em in deeds: they say poore Suters haue
62    *strong breaths, they shal know we haue strong arms too.
63    *<S {Menen}.> Why Masters, my good Friends, mine honest
64     Neighbours, will you vndo your selues?
65     <S 2 {Cit}.> We cannot Sir, we are vndone already.
66     <S {Men}.> I tell you Friends, most charitable care
67     Haue the Patricians of you for your wants.
68     Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
69     Strike at the Heauen with your staues, as lift them
70     Against the Roman State, whose course will on
71     The way it takes: cracking ten thousand Curbes
72     Of more strong linke assunder, then can euer
73     Appeare in your impediment. For the Dearth,
74     The Gods, not the Patricians make it, and
75     Your knees to them (not armes) must helpe. Alacke,
76     You are transported by Calamity
77     Thether, where more attends you, and you slander
78     The Helmes o'th State; who care for you like Fathers,
79     When you curse them, as Enemies.
80     <S 2 {Cit}.> Care for vs? True indeed, they nere car'd for vs
81    *yet. Suffer vs to famish, and their Store- houses cramm'd
82    *with Graine: Make Edicts for Vsurie, to support Vsu-rers;
83    *repeale daily any wholsome Act established against
84    *the rich, and prouide more piercing Statutes daily, to
85    *chaine vp and restraine the poore. If the Warres eate vs
86    *not vppe, they will; and there's all the loue they beare
87     vs.
88     <S {Menen}.> Either you must
89     Confesse your selues wondrous Malicious,
90     Or be accus'd of Folly. I shall tell you
91     A pretty Tale, it may be you haue heard it,
92     But since it serues my purpose, I will venture
93     To scale't a little more.
94     <S 2 {Citizen}.> Well,
95     Ile heare it Sir: yet you must not thinke
96     To fobbe off our disgrace with a tale:
97     But and't please you deliuer.
98    *<S {Men}.> There was a time, when all the bodies members
99     Rebell'd against the Belly; thus accus'd it:
100    That onely like a Gulfe it did remaine
      <P aa1v>
101    I'th midd'st #a th' body, idle and vnactiue,
102    Still cubbording the Viand, neuer bearing
103    Like labour with the rest, where th' other Instruments
104    Did see, and heare, deuise, instruct, walke, feele,
105    And mutually participate, did minister
106    Vnto the appetite; and affection common
107    Of the whole body, the Belly answer'd.
108    <S 2.{Cit}.> Well sir, what answer made the Belly.
109    <S {Men}.> Sir, I shall tell you with a kinde of Smile,
110    Which ne're came from the Lungs, but euen thus:
111    For looke you I may make the belly Smile,
112    As well as speake, it taintingly replyed
113    To'th' discontented Members, the mutinous parts
114    That enuied his receite: euen so most fitly,
115    As you maligne our Senators, for that
116    They are not such as you.
117    <S 2.{Cit}.> Your Bellies answer: What
118    The Kingly crown'd head, the vigilant eye,
119    The Counsailor Heart, the Arme our Souldier,
120    Our Steed the Legge, the Tongue our Trumpeter,
121    With other Muniments and petty helpes
122    In this our Fabricke, if that they===
123    <S {Men}.> What then? Fore me, this Fellow speakes.
124    What then? What then?
125    <S 2.{Cit}.> Should by the Cormorant belly be restrain'd,
126    Who is the sinke #a th' body.
127    <S {Men}.> Well, what then?
128    <S 2.{Cit}.> The former Agents, if they did complaine,
129    What could the Belly answer?
130    <S {Men}.> I will tell you,
131    If you'l bestow a small (of what you haue little)
132    Patience awhile; you'st heare the Bellies answer.
133    <S 2.{Cit}.> Y'are long about it.
134    <S {Men}.> Note me this good Friend;
135    Your most graue Belly was deliberate,
136    Not rash like his Accusers, and thus answered.
137    True is it my Incorporate Friends (quoth he)
138    That I receiue the generall Food at first
139    Which you do liue vpon: and fit it is,
140    Because I am the Store- house, and the Shop
141    Of the whole Body. But, if you do remember,
142    I send it through the Riuers of your blood
143    Euen to the Court, the Heart, to th' seate o'th' Braine,
144    And through the Crankes and Offices of man,
145    The strongest Nerues, and small inferiour Veines
146    From me receiue that naturall competencie
147    Whereby they liue. And though that all at once
148    (You my good Friends, this sayes the Belly) marke me.
149    <S 2.{Cit}.> #I sir, well, well.
150    <S {Men}.> Though all at once, cannot
151    See what I do deliuer out to each,
152    Yet I can make my Awdit vp, that all
153    From me do backe receiue the Flowre of all,
154    And leaue me but the Bran. What say you too't?
155    <S 2.{Cit}.> It was an answer, how apply you this?
156    <S {Men}.> The Senators of Rome, are this good Belly,
157    And you the mutinous Members: For examine
158   *Their Counsailes, and their Cares; disgest things rightly,
159    Touching the Weale a'th Common, you shall finde
160    No publique benefit which you receiue
161    But it proceeds, or comes from them to you,
162    And no way from your selues. What do you thinke?
163    You, the great Toe of this Assembly?
164    <S 2.{Cit}.> I the great Toe? Why the great Toe?
165    <S {Men}.> For that being one o'th lowest, basest, poorest
166    Of this most wise Rebellion, thou goest formost:
167    Thou Rascall, that art worst in blood to run,
168    Lead'st first to win some vantage.
169    But make you ready your stiffe bats and clubs,
170    Rome, and her Rats, are at the point of battell,
171    The one side must haue baile.
172    <D {Enter Caius Martius}.>
173    Hayle, Noble {Martius}.
174   *<S {Mar}.> Thanks. What's the matter you dissentious rogues
175    That rubbing the poore Itch of your Opinion,
176    Make your selues Scabs.
177    <S 2.{Cit}.> We haue euer your good word.
178   *<S {Mar}.> He that will giue good words to thee, wil flatter
179   *Beneath abhorring. What would you haue, you Curres,
180    That like nor Peace, nor Warre? The one affrights you,
181    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
182    Where he should finde you Lyons, findes you Hares:
183    Where Foxes, Geese you are: No surer, no,
184    Then is the coale of fire vpon the Ice,
185    Or Hailstone in the Sun. Your Vertue is,
186    To make him worthy, whose offence subdues him,
187    And curse that Iustice did it. Who deserues Greatnes,
188    Deserues your Hate: and your Affections are
189    A sickmans Appetite; who desires most that
190    Which would encrease his euill. He that depends
191    Vpon your fauours, swimmes with finnes of Leade,
192   *And hewes downe Oakes, with rushes. Hang ye: trust ye?
193    With euery Minute you do change a Minde,
194    And call him Noble, that was now your Hate:
195    Him vilde, that was your Garland. What's the matter,
196    That in these seuerall places of the Citie,
197    You cry against the Noble Senate, who
198    (Vnder the Gods) keepe you in awe, which else
199    Would feede on one another? What's their seeking?
200   *<S {Men}.> For Corne at their owne rates, wherof they say
201    The Citie is well stor'd.
202    <S {Mar}.> Hang 'em: They say?
203    They'l sit by th' fire, and presume to know
204    What's done i'th Capitoll: Who's like to rise,
205    Who thriues, & who declines: Side factions, & giue out
206    Coniecturall Marriages, making parties strong,
207    And feebling such as stand not in their liking,
208   *Below their cobled Shooes. They say ther's grain enough?
209    Would the Nobility lay aside their ruth,
210    And let me vse my Sword, I'de make a Quarrie
211    With thousands of these quarter'd slaues, as high
212    As I could picke my Lance.
213    <S {Menen}.> Nay these are almost thoroughly perswaded:
214    For though abundantly they lacke discretion
215    Yet are they passing Cowardly. But I beseech you,
216    What sayes the other Troope?
217    <S {Mar}.> They are dissolu'd: Hang em;
218    They said they were #an hungry, sigh'd forth Prouerbes
219    That Hunger- broke stone wals: that dogges must eate
220   *That meate was made for mouths. That the gods sent not
221    Corne for the Richmen onely: With these shreds
222   *They vented their Complainings, which being answer'd
223    And a petition granted them, a strange one,
224    To breake the heart of generosity,
225   *And make bold power looke pale, they threw their caps
226    As they would hang them on the hornes a'th Moone,
227    Shooting their Emulation.
228    <S {Menen}.> What is graunted them?
229   *<S {Mar}.> Fiue Tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
230    Of their owne choice. One's {Iunius Brutus},
231    {Sicinius Velutus}, and I know not. Sdeath,
      <P aa2>
232    The rabble should haue first vnroo'st the City
233    Ere so preuayl'd with me; it will in time
234    Win vpon power, and throw forth greater Theames
235    For Insurrections arguing.
236    <S {Menen}.> This is strange.
237    <S {Mar}.> Go get you home you Fragments.
238    <D {Enter a Messenger hastily}.>
239    <S {Mess}.> Where's {Caius Martius}?
240    <S {Mar}.> Heere: what's the matter!
241    <S {Mes}.> The newes is sir, the Volcies are in Armes.
242   *<S {Mar}.> I am glad on't, then we shall #ha meanes to vent
243    Our mustie superfluity. See our best Elders.
244    <D {Enter Sicinius Velutus, Annius Brutus Cominius, Titus}
245    {#Lartius, with other Senatours}.>
246   *<S 1.{Sen}.> {Martius} 'tis true, that you haue lately told vs,
247    The Volces are in Armes.
248    <S {Mar}.> They haue a Leader,
249    {Tullus Auffidius} that will put you too't:
250    I sinne in enuying his Nobility:
251    And were I any thing but what I am,
252    I would wish me onely he.
253    <S {Com}.> You haue fought together?
254   *<S {Mar}.> Were halfe to halfe the world by th' eares, & he
255    vpon my partie, I'de reuolt to make
256    Onely my warres with him. He is a Lion
257    That I am proud to hunt.
258    <S 1.{Sen}.> Then worthy {Martius},
259    Attend vpon {Cominius} to these Warres.
260    <S {Com}.> It is your former promise.
261    <S {Mar}.> Sir it is,
262    And I am constant: {Titus Lucius}, thou
263    Shalt see me once more strike at {Tullus} face.
264    What art thou stiffe? Stand'st out?
265    <S {Tit}.> No {Caius Martius},
266    Ile leane vpon one Crutch, and fight with tother,
267    Ere stay behinde this Businesse.
268    <S {Men}.> Oh true- bred.
269    <S {Sen}.> Your Company to'th' Capitoll, where I know
270    Our greatest Friends attend vs.
271   *<S {Tit}.> Lead you on: Follow {Cominius}, we must followe
272    you, right worthy your Priority.
273    <S {Com}.> Noble {Martius}.
274    <S {Sen}.> Hence to your homes, be gone.
275    <S {Mar}.> Nay let them follow,
276    The Volces haue much Corne: take these Rats thither,
277    To gnaw their Garners. Worshipfull Mutiners,
278    Your valour puts well forth: Pray follow.  <D {Exeunt}.>
279    <D {Citizens steale away. Manet Sicin. & Brutus}.>
280    <S {Sicin}.> Was euer man so proud as is this {Martius}?
281    <S {Bru}.> He has no equall.
282   *<S {Sicin}.> When we were chosen Tribunes for the people.
283    <S {Bru}.> Mark'd you his lip and eyes.
284    <S {Sicin}.> Nay, but his taunts.
285   *<S {Bru}.> Being mou'd, he will not spare to gird the Gods.
286    <S {Sicin}.> Bemocke the modest Moone.
287   *<S {Bru}.> The present Warres deuoure him, he is growne
288    Too proud to be so valiant.
289   *<S {Sicin}.> Such a Nature, tickled with good successe, dis-daines
290   *the shadow which he treads on at noone, but I do
291   *wonder, his insolence can brooke to be commanded vn-der
292    {Cominius}?
293    <S {Bru}.> Fame, at the which he aymes,
294    In whom already he's well grac'd, cannot
295    Better be held, nor more attain'd then by
296    A place below the first: for what miscarries
297    Shall be the Generals fault, though he performe
298    To th' vtmost of a man, and giddy censure
299    Will then cry out of {Martius:} Oh, if he
300    Had borne the businesse.
301    <S {Sicin}.> Besides, if things go well,
302    Opinion that so stickes on {Martius}, shall
303    Of his demerits rob {Cominius}.
304   *<S {Bru}.> Come: halfe all {Cominius} Honors are to {Martius}
305    Though {Martius} earn'd them not: and all his faults
306    To {Martius} shall be Honors, though indeed
307    In ought he merit not.
308    <S {Sicin}.> Let's hence, and heare
309    How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion
310    More then his singularity, he goes
311    Vpon this present Action.
312    <S {Bru}.> Let's along.  <D {Exeunt}>
313    <D {Enter Tullus Auffidius with Senators of Coriolus}.>
314    <S 1.{Sen}.> So, your opinion is {Auffidius},
315    That they of Rome are entred in our Counsailes,
316    And know how we proceede,
317    <S {Auf}.> Is it not yours?
318    What euer haue bin thought one in this State
319    That could be brought to bodily act, ere Rome
320    Had circumuention: 'tis not foure dayes gone
321    Since I heard thence, these are the words, I thinke
322    I haue the Letter heere: yes, heere it is;
323    They haue prest a Power, but it is not knowne
324    Whether for East or West: the Dearth is great,
325    The people Mutinous: And it is rumour'd,
326    {Cominius}, {Martius} your old Enemy
327    (Who is of Rome worse hated then of you)
328    And {Titus Lartius}, a most valiant Roman,
329    These three leade on this Preparation
330    Whether 'tis bent: most likely, 'tis for you:
331    Consider of it.
332    <S 1.{Sen}.> Our Armie's in the Field:
333    We neuer yet made doubt but Rome was ready
334    To answer vs.
335    <S {Auf}.> Nor did you thinke it folly,
336    To keepe your great pretences vayl'd, till when
337   *They needs must shew themselues, which in the hatching
338    It seem'd appear'd to Rome. By the discouery,
339    We shalbe shortned in our ayme, which was
340    To take in many Townes, ere (almost) Rome
341    Should know we were a- foot.
342    <S 2.{Sen}.> Noble {Auffidius},
343    Take your Commission, hye you to your Bands,
344    Let vs alone to guard {Corioles}
345    If they set downe before's: for the remoue
346    Bring vp your Army: but (I thinke) you'l finde
347    Th'haue not prepar'd for vs.
348    <S {Auf}.> O doubt not that,
349    I speake from Certainties. Nay more,
350    Some parcels of their Power are forth already,
351    And onely hitherward. I leaue your Honors.
352    If we, and {Caius Martius} chance to meete,
353    'Tis sworne betweene vs, we shall euer strike
354    Till one can do no more.
355    <S {All}.> The Gods assist you.
356    <S {Auf}.> And keepe your Honors safe.
357    <S 1.{Sen}.> Farewell.
358    <S 2.{Sen}.> Farewell.
359    <S {All}.> Farewell.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>

362   *<S {Volum}.> I pray you daughter sing, or expresse your selfe
363   *in a more comfortable sort: If my Sonne were my Hus-band,
364   *I should freelier reioyce in that absence wherein
365   *he wonne Honor, then in the embracements of his Bed,
366   *where he would shew most loue. When yet hee was but
367   *tender- bodied, and the onely Sonne of my womb; when
368   *youth with comelinesse pluck'd all gaze his way; when
369   *for a day of Kings entreaties, a Mother should not sel him
370   *an houre from her beholding; I considering how Honour
371   *would become such a person, that it was no better then
372   *Picture- like to hang by th' wall, if renowne made it not
373   *stirre, was pleas'd to let him seeke danger, where he was
374   *like to finde fame: To a cruell Warre I sent him, from
375   *whence he return'd, his browes bound with Oake. I tell
376   *thee Daughter, I sprang not more in ioy at first hearing
377   *he was a Man- child, then now in first seeing he had pro-ued
378    himselfe a man.
379   *<S {Virg}.> But had he died in the Businesse Madame, how
380    then?
381   *<S {Volum}.> Then his good report should haue beene my
382   *Sonne, I therein would haue found issue. Heare me pro-fesse
383   *sincerely, had I a dozen sons each in my loue alike,
384   *and none lesse deere then thine, and my good {Martius}, I
385   *had rather had eleuen dye Nobly for their Countrey, then
386    one voluptuously surfet out of Action.
387    <D {Enter a Gentlewoman}.>
388    <S {Gent}.> Madam, the lady {Valeria} is come to visit you.
389    <S {Virg}.> Beseech you giue me leaue to retire my selfe.
390    <S {Volum}.> Indeed you shall not:
391    Me thinkes, I heare hither your Husbands Drumme:
392    See him plucke {Auffidius} downe by th' haire:
393    (As children from a Beare) the {Volces} shunning him:
394    Me thinkes I see him stampe thus, and call thus,
395    Come on you Cowards, you were got in feare
396    Though you were borne in Rome; his bloody brow
397    With his mail'd hand, then wiping, forth he goes
398    Like to a Haruest man, that task'd to mowe
399    Or all, or loose his hyre.
400    <S {Virg}.> His bloody Brow? Oh Iupiter, no blood.
401    <S {Volum}.> Away you Foole; it more becomes a man
402    Then gilt his Trophe. The brests of {Hecuba}
403    When she did suckle {Hector}, look'd not louelier
404    Then {Hectors} forhead, when it spit forth blood
405    At Grecian sword. {Contenning}, tell {Valeria}
406    We are fit to bid her welcome.  <D {Exit Gent}.>
407    <S {Vir}.> Heauens blesse my Lord from fell {Auffidius}.
408    <S {Vol}.> Hee'l beat {Auffidius} head below his knee,
409    And treade vpon his necke.
410    <D {Enter Valeria with an Vsher, and a Gentlewoman}.>
411    <S {Val}.> My Ladies both good day to you.
412    <S {Vol}.> Sweet Madam.
413    <S {Vir}.> I am glad to see your Ladyship.
414   *<S {Val}.> How do you both? You are manifest house- kee-pers.
415   *What are you sowing heere? A fine spotte in good
416    faith. How does your little Sonne?
417    <S {Vir}.> I thanke your Lady- ship: Well good Madam.
418   *<S {Vol}.> He had rather see the swords, and heare a Drum,
419    then looke vpon his Schoolmaster.
420   *<S {Val}.> #A my word the Fathers Sonne: Ile sweare 'tis a
421   *very pretty boy. #A my troth, I look'd vpon him a Wens-day
422   *halfe an houre together: #ha's such a confirm'd coun-tenance.
423   *I saw him run after a gilded Butterfly, & when
424   *he caught it, he let it go againe, and after it againe, and o-uer
425   *and ouer he comes, and vp againe: catcht it again: or
426   *whether his fall enrag'd him, or how 'twas, hee did so set
427   *his teeth, and teare it. Oh, I warrant how he mammockt
428    it.
429    <S {Vol}.> One on's Fathers moods.
430    <S {Val}.> Indeed la, tis a Noble childe.
431    <S {Virg}.> A Cracke Madam.
432   *<S {Val}.> Come, lay aside your stitchery, I must haue you
433    play the idle Huswife with me this afternoone.
434    <S {Virg}.> No (good Madam)
435    I will not out of doores.
436    <S {Val}.> Not out of doores?
437    <S {Volum}.> She shall, she shall.
438   *<S {Virg}.> Indeed no, by your patience; Ile not ouer the
439    threshold, till my Lord returne from the Warres.
440   *<S {Val}.> Fye, you confine your selfe most vnreasonably:
441    Come, you must go visit the good Lady that lies in.
442   *<S {Virg}.> I will wish her speedy strength, and visite her
443    with my prayers: but I cannot go thither.
444    <S {Volum}.> Why I pray you.
445    <S {Vlug}.> 'Tis not to saue labour, nor that I want loue.
446   *<S {Val}.> You would be another {Penelope}: yet they say, all
447   *the yearne she spun in {Vlisses} absence, did but fill {Athica}
448   *full of Mothes. Come, I would your Cambrick were sen-sible
449   *as your finger, that you might leaue pricking it for
450    pitie. Come you shall go with vs.
451   *<S {Vir}.> No good Madam, pardon me, indeed I will not
452    foorth.
453   *<S {Val}.> In truth la go with me, and Ile tell you excellent
454    newes of your Husband.
455    <S {Virg}.> Oh good Madam, there can be none yet.
456   *<S {Val}.> Verily I do not iest with you: there came newes
457    from him last night.
458    <S {Vir}.> Indeed Madam.
459   *<S {Val}.> In earnest it's true; I heard a Senatour speake it.
460   *Thus it is: the Volcies haue an Army forth, against who[m]
461   *{Cominius} the Generall is gone, with one part of our Ro-mane
462   *power. Your Lord, and {Titus Lartius}, are set down
463   *before their Citie {Carioles}, they nothing doubt preuai-ling,
464   *and to make it breefe Warres. This is true on mine
465    Honor, and so I pray go with vs.
466   *<S {Virg}.> Giue me excuse good Madame, I will obey you
467    in euery thing heereafter.
468    <S {Vol}.> Let her alone Ladie, as she is now:
469    She will but disease our better mirth.
470    <S {Valeria}.> In troth I thinke she would:
471    Fare you well then. Come good sweet Ladie.
472    Prythee {Virgilia} turne thy solemnesse out #a doore,
473    And go along with vs.
474    <S {Virgil}.> No
475    At a word Madam; Indeed I must not,
476    I wish you much mirth.
477    <S {Val}.> Well, then farewell.  <D {Exeunt Ladies}.>
478   *<D {Enter Martius, Titus Lartius, with Drumme and Co-lours},
479    {with Captaines and Souldiers, as}
480    {before the City Corialus: to them}
481    {a Messenger}.>
482    <S {Martius}.> Yonder comes Newes:
483    A Wager they haue met.
484    <S {Lar}.> My horse to yours, no.
485    <S {Mar}.> Tis done.
486    <S {Lart}.> Agreed.
      <P aa3>
487    <S {Mar}.> Say, ha's our Generall met the Enemy?
488    <S {Mess}.> They lye in view, but haue not spoke as yet.
489    <S {Lart}.> So, the good Horse is mine.
490    <S {Mart}.> Ile buy him of you.
491   *<S {Lart}.> No, Ile nor sel, nor giue him: Lend you him I will
492    For halfe a hundred yeares: Summon the Towne.
493    <S {Mar}.> How farre off lie these Armies?
494    <S {Mess}.> Within this mile and halfe.
495   *<S {Mar}.> Then shall we heare their Larum, & they Ours.
496    Now Mars, I prythee make vs quicke in worke,
497    That we with smoaking swords may march from hence
498    To helpe our fielded Friends. Come, blow thy blast.
499    <D {They Sound a Parley: Enter two Senators with others on}
500    {the Walles of Corialus}.>
501    {Tullus Auffidious}, is he within your Walles?
502    <S 1.{Senat}.> No, nor a man that feares you lesse then he,
503    That's lesser then a little:  <D {Drum #a farre off}.>
504    Hearke, our Drummes
505   *Are bringing forth our youth: Wee'l breake our Walles
506    Rather then they shall pound vs vp our Gates,
507    Which yet seeme shut, we haue but pin'd with Rushes,
508    They'le open of themselues. Harke you, farre off
509    <D {Alarum farre off}.>
510    There is {Auffidious}. List what worke he makes
511    Among'st your clouen Army.
512    <S {Mart}.> Oh they are at it.
513    <S {Lart}.> Their noise be our instruction. Ladders hoa.
514    <D {Enter the Army of the Volces}.>
515    <S {Mar}.> They feare vs not, but issue forth their Citie.
516    Now put your Shields before your hearts, and fight
517    With hearts more proofe then Shields.
518    Aduance braue {Titus},
519    They do disdaine vs much beyond our Thoughts,
520   *which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on my fellows
521    He that retires, Ile take him for a {Volce},
522    And he shall feele mine edge.
523    <D {Alarum, the Romans are beat back to their Trenches}
524    {Enter Martius Cursing}.>
525    <S {Mar}.> All the contagion of the South, light on you,
526   *You Shames of Rome: you Heard of Byles and Plagues
527    Plaister you o're, that you may be abhorr'd
528    Farther then seene, and one infect another
529    Against the Winde a mile: you soules of Geese,
530    That beare the shapes of men, how haue you run
531    From Slaues, that Apes would beate; {Pluto} and #Hell,
532    All hurt behinde, backes red, and faces pale
533    With flight and agued feare, mend and charge home,
534    Or by the fires of heauen, Ile leaue the Foe,
535    And make my Warres on you: Looke too't: Come on,
536    If you'l stand fast, wee'l beate them to their Wiues,
537    As they vs to our Trenches followes.
538    <D {Another Alarum, and Martius followes them to}
539    {gates, and is shut in}.>
540    So, now the gates are ope: now proue good Seconds,
541    'Tis for the followers Fortune, widens them,
542    Not for the flyers: Marke me, and do the like.
543    <D {Enter the Gati}.>
544    <S 1.{Sol}.> Foole- hardinesse, not I.
545    <S 2.{Sol}.> Nor I.
546    <S 1.{Sol}.> See they haue shut him in.  <D {Alarum continues}>
547    <S {All}.> To th' pot I warrant him. <D {Enter Titus Lartius}>
548    <S {Tit}.> What is become of {Martius}?
549    <S {All}.> Slaine (Sir) doubtlesse.
550    <S 1.{Sol}.> Following the Flyers at the very heeles,
551    With them he enters: who vpon the sodaine
552    Clapt to their Gates, he is himselfe alone,
553    To answer all the City.
554    <S {Lar}.> Oh Noble Fellow!
555    Who sensibly out- dares his sencelesse Sword,
556    And when it bowes, stand'st vp: Thou art left {Martius},
557    A Carbuncle intire: as big as thou art
558    Weare not so rich a Iewell. Thou was't a Souldier
559    Euen to {Calues} wish, not fierce and terrible
560    Onely in strokes, but with thy grim lookes, and
561    The Thunder- like percussion of thy sounds
562    Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the World
563    Were Feauorous, and did tremble.
564    <D {Enter Martius bleeding, assaulted by the Enemy}.>
565    <S 1.{Sol}.> Looke Sir.
566    <S {Lar}.> O 'tis {Martius}.
567    Let's fetch him off, or make remaine alike.
568    <D {They fight, and all enter the City}.>
569    <D {Enter certaine Romanes with spoiles}.>
570    <S 1.{Rom}.> This will I carry to {Rome}.
571    <S 2.{Rom}.> And I this.
572   *<S 3.{Rom}.> A Murrain on't, I tooke this for Siluer.  <D {Exeunt}.>
573    <D {Alarum continues still a- farre off}.>
574    <D {Enter Martius, and Titus with a Trumpet}.>
575   *<S {Mar}.> See heere these mouers, that do prize their hours
576    At a crack'd Drachme: Cushions, Leaden Spoones,
577    Irons of a Doit, Dublets that Hangmen would
578    Bury with those that wore them. These base slaues,
579    Ere yet the fight be done, packe vp, downe with them.
580    And harke, what noyse the Generall makes: To him
581    There is the man of my soules hate, {Auffidious},
582    Piercing our Romanes: Then Valiant {Titus} take
583    Conuenient Numbers to make good the City,
584    Whil'st I with those that haue the spirit, wil haste
585    To helpe {Cominius}.
586    <S {Lar}.> Worthy Sir, thou bleed'st,
587    Thy exercise hath bin too violent,
588    For a second course of Fight.
589    <S {Mar}.> Sir, praise me not:
590    My worke hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well:
591    The blood I drop, is rather Physicall
592   *Then dangerous to me: To {Auffidious} thus, I will appear |(and fight.
593    <S {Lar}.> Now the faire Goddesse Fortune,
594    Fall deepe in loue with thee, and her great charmes
595    Misguide thy Opposers swords, Bold Gentleman:
596    Prosperity be thy Page.
597    <S {Mar}.> Thy Friend no lesse,
598    Then those she placeth highest: So farewell.
599    <S {Lar}.> Thou worthiest {Martius},
600    Go sound thy Trumpet in the Market place,
601    Call thither all the Officers a'th' Towne,
602    Where they shall know our minde. Away.  <D {Exeunt}>
603    <D {Enter Cominius as it were in retire, with soldiers}.>
604   *<S {Com}.> Breath you my friends, wel fought, we are come |(off,
605    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
606    Nor Cowardly in retyre: Beleeue me Sirs,
607    We shall be charg'd againe. Whiles we haue strooke
608    By Interims and conueying gusts, we haue heard
609    The Charges of our Friends. The Roman Gods,
610    Leade their successes, as we wish our owne,
611   *That both our powers, with smiling Fronts encountring,
612    May giue you thankfull Sacrifice. Thy Newes?
613    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
614    <S {Mess}.> The Cittizens of {Corioles} haue yssued,
615    And giuen to {Lartius} and to {Martius} Battaile:
      <P aa3v>
616    I saw our party to their Trenches driuen,
617    And then I came away.
618    <S {Com}.> Though thou speakest truth,
619   *Me thinkes thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?
620    <S {Mes}.> Aboue an houre, my Lord.
621   *<S {Com}.> 'Tis not a mile: briefely we heard their drummes.
622    How could'st thou in a mile confound an houre,
623    And bring thy Newes so late?
624    <S {Mes}.> Spies of the {Volces}
625    Held me in chace, that I was forc'd to wheele
626    Three or foure miles about, else had I sir
627    Halfe an houre since brought my report.
628    <D {Enter Martius}.>
629    <S {Com}.> Whose yonder,
630    That doe's appeare as he were Flead? O Gods,
631    He has the stampe of {Martius}, and I haue
632    Before time seene him thus.
633    <S {Mar}.> Come I too late?
634   *<S {Com}.> The Shepherd knowes not Thunder fro[m] a Taber,
635    More then I know the sound of {Martius} Tongue
636    From euery meaner man.
637    <S {Martius}.> Come I too late?
638    <S {Com}.> #I, if you come not in the blood of others,
639    But mantled in your owne.
640    <S {Mart}.> Oh! let me clip ye
641    In Armes as sound, as when I woo'd in heart;
642    As merry, as when our Nuptiall day was done,
643    And Tapers burnt to Bedward.
644   *<S {Com}.> Flower of Warriors, how is't with {Titus Lartius}?
645    <S {Mar}.> As with a man busied about Decrees:
646    Condemning some to death, and some to exile,
647    Ransoming him, or pittying, threatning th' other;
648    Holding {Corioles} in the name of Rome,
649    Euen like a fawning Grey- hound in the Leash,
650    To let him slip at #will.
651    <S {Com}.> Where is that Slaue
652    Which told me they had beate you to your Trenches?
653    Where is he? Call him hither.
654    <S {Mar}.> Let him alone,
655    He did informe the truth: but for our Gentlemen,
656    The common file, (a plague- Tribunes for them)
657    The Mouse ne're shunn'd the Cat, as they did budge
658    From Rascals worse then they.
659    <S {Com}.> But how preuail'd you?
660    <S {Mar}.> Will the time serue to tell, I do not thinke:
661    Where is the enemy? Are you Lords a'th Field?
662    If not, why cease you till you are so?
663    <S {Com}.> {Martius}, we haue at disaduantage fought,
664    And did retyre to win our purpose.
665    <S {Mar}.> How lies their Battell? Know you on w side
666    They haue plac'd their men of trust?
667    <S {Com}.> As I guesse {Martius},
668    Their Bands i'th Vaward are the Antients
669    Of their best trust: O're them {Auffidious},
670    Their very heart of Hope.
671    <S {Mar}.> I do beseech you,
672    By all the Battailes wherein we haue fought,
673    By th' Blood we haue shed together,
674    By th' Vowes we haue made
675    To endure Friends, that you directly set me
676    Against {Affidious}, and his {Antiats},
677    And that you not delay the present (but
678    Filling the aire with Swords aduanc'd) and Darts,
679    We proue this very houre.
680    <S {Com}.> Though I could wish,
681    You were conducted to a gentle Bath,
682    And Balmes applyed to you, yet dare I neuer
683    Deny your asking, take your choice of those
684    That best can ayde your action.
685    <S {Mar}.> Those are they
686    That most are willing; if any such be heere,
687    (As it were sinne to doubt) that loue this painting
688    Wherein you see me smear'd, if any feare
689    Lessen his person, then an #ill report:
690    If any thinke, braue death out- weighes bad life,
691    And that his Countries deerer then himselfe,
692    Let him alone: Or so many so minded,
693    Waue thus to expresse his disposition,
694    And follow {Martius}.
695   *<D {They all shout and waue their swords, take him vp in their}
696    {Armes, and cast vp their Caps}.>
697    Oh me alone, make you a sword of me:
698    If these shewes be not outward, which of you
699    But is foure {Volces}? None of you, but is
700    Able to beare against the great {Auffidious}
701    A Shield, as hard as his. A certaine number
702    (Though thankes to all) must I select from all:
703    The rest shall beare the businesse in some other fight
704    (As cause will be obey'd:) please you to March,
705    And foure shall quickly draw out my Command,
706    Which men are best inclin'd.
707    <S {Com}.> March on my Fellowes:
708    Make good this ostentation, and you shall
709    Diuide in all, with vs.  <D {Exeunt}>
710   *<D {Titus Lartius, hauing set a guard vpon Carioles, going with}
711   *{Drum and Trumpet toward Cominius, and Caius Mar-tius},
712   *{Enters with a Lieutenant, other Souldiours, and a}
713    {Scout}.>
714   *<S {Lar}.> So, let the Ports be guarded; keepe your Duties
715    As I haue set them downe. If I do send, dispatch
716    Those Centuries to our ayd, the rest will serue
717    For a short holding, if we loose the Field,
718    We cannot keepe the Towne.
719    <S {Lieu}.> Feare not our care Sir.
720    <S {Lart}.> Hence; and shut your gates vpon's:
721   *Our Guider come, to th' Roman Campe conduct vs. <D {Exit}>
722    <D {Alarum, as in Battaile}.>
723    <D {Enter Martius and Auffidius at seueral doores}.>
724    <S {Mar}.> Ile fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
725    Worse then a Promise- breaker.
726    <S {Auffid}.> We hate alike:
727    Not Affricke ownes a Serpent I abhorre
728    More then thy Fame and Enuy: Fix thy foot.
729    <S {Mar}.> Let the first Budger dye the others Slaue,
730    And the Gods doome him after.
731    <S {Auf}.> If I flye {Martius}, hollow me like a Hare.
732    <S {Mar}.> Within these three houres {Tullus}
733    Alone I fought in your {Corioles} walles,
734    And made what worke I pleas'd: 'Tis not my blood,
735    Wherein thou seest me maskt, for thy Reuenge
736    Wrench vp thy power to th' highest.
737    <S {Auf}.> Wer't thou the {Hector},
738    That was the whip of your bragg'd Progeny,
739    Thou should'st not scape me heere.
740   *<D {Heere they fight, and certaine Volces come in the ayde}
741   *{of Auffi. Martius fights til they be driuen in breathles}.>
742    Officious and not valiant, you haue sham'd me
743    In your condemned Seconds.
      <P aa4><C A>
744    <D {Flourish. Alarum. A Retreat is sounded. Enter at}
745    {one Doore Cominius, with the Romanes: At}
746    {another Doore Martius, with his}
747    {Arme in a Scarfe}.>
748    <S {Com}.> If I should tell thee o're this thy dayes Worke,
749    Thou't not beleeue thy deeds: but Ile report it,
750    Where Senators shall mingle teares with smiles,
751    Where great Patricians shall attend, and shrug,
752    I'th' end admire: where Ladies shall be frighted,
753   *And gladly quak'd, heare more: where the dull Tribunes,
754    That with the fustie Plebeans, hate thine Honors,
755    Shall say against their hearts, We thanke the Gods
756    Our Rome hath such a Souldier.
757    Yet cam'st thou to a Morsell of this Feast,
758    Hauing fully din'd before.
759    <D {Enter Titus with his Power, from the Pursuit}.>
760    <S {Titus} {Lartius}.> Oh Generall:
761    Here is the Steed, wee the Caparison:
762    Hadst thou beheld===
763    <S {Martius}.> Pray now, no more:
764    My Mother, who ha's a Charter to extoll her Bloud,
765    When she do's prayse me, grieues me:
766    I haue done as you haue done, that's what I can,
767    Induc'd as you haue beene, that's for my Countrey:
768    He that ha's but effected his good #will,
769    Hath ouerta'ne mine Act.
770    <S {Com}.> You shall not be the Graue of your deseruing,
771    Rome must know the value of her owne:
772    'Twere a Concealement worse then a Theft,
773    No lesse then a Traducement,
774    To hide your doings, and to silence that,
775    Which to the spire, and top of prayses vouch'd,
776    Would seeme but modest: therefore I beseech you,
777    In signe of what you are, not to reward
778    What you haue done, before our Armie heare me.
779   *<S {Martius}.> I haue some Wounds vpon me, and they smart
780    To heare themselues remembred.
781    <S {Com}.> Should they not:
782    Well might they fester 'gainst Ingratitude,
783    And tent themselues with death: of all the Horses,
784    Whereof we haue ta'ne good, and good store of all,
785    The Treasure in this field atchieued, and Citie,
786    We render you the Tenth, to be ta'ne forth,
787    Before the common distribution,
788    At your onely choyse.
789    <S {Martius}.> I thanke you Generall:
790    But cannot make my heart consent to take
791    A Bribe, to pay my Sword: I doe refuse it,
792    And stand vpon my common part with those,
793    That haue beheld the doing.
794    <D {A long flourish. They all cry, Martius, Martius},
795    {cast vp their Caps and Launces: Cominius}
796    {and Lartius stand bare}.>
797   *<S {Mar}.> May these same Instruments, which you prophane,
798    Neuer sound more: when Drums and Trumpets shall
799    I'th' field proue flatterers, let Courts and Cities be
800    Made all of false- fac'd soothing:
801    When Steele growes soft, as the Parasites Silke,
802    Let him be made an Ouerture for th' Warres:
803    No more I say, for that I haue not wash'd
804    My Nose that bled, or foyl'd some debile Wretch,
805    Which without note, here's many else haue done,
806    You shoot me forth in acclamations hyperbolicall,
807    As if I lou'd my little should be dieted
808    In prayses, sawc'st with Lyes.
809    <S {Com}.> Too modest are you:
810    More cruell to your good report, then gratefull
811    To vs, that giue you truly: by your patience,
812    If 'gainst your selfe you be incens'd, wee'le put you
813    (Like one that meanes his proper harme) in Manacles,
814    Then reason safely with you: Therefore be it knowne,
815    As to vs, to all the World, That {Caius Martius}
816    Weares this Warres Garland: in token of the which,
817    My Noble Steed, knowne to the Campe, I giue him,
818    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
819    For what he did before {Corioles}, call him,
820    With all th' applause and Clamor of the Hoast,
821   *{Marcus Caius Coriolanus}. Beare th' addition Nobly euer?
822    <D {Flourish. Trumpets sound, and Drums}.>
823    <S {Omnes}.> {Marcus Caius Coriolanus}.
824    <S {Martius}.> I will goe wash:
825    And when my Face is faire, you shall perceiue
826    Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thanke you,
827    I meane to stride your Steed, and at all times
828    To vnder- crest your good Addition,
829    To th' fairenesse of my power.
830    <S {Com}.> So, to our Tent:
831    Where ere we doe repose vs, we will write
832    To Rome of our successe: you {Titus Lartius}
833    Must to {Corioles} backe, send vs to Rome
834    The best, with whom we may articulate,
835    For their owne good, and ours.
836    <S {Lartius}.> I shall, my Lord.
837    <S {Martius}.> The Gods begin to mocke me:
838    I that now refus'd most Princely gifts,
839    Am bound to begge of my Lord Generall.
840    <S {Com}.> Tak't, 'tis yours: what is't?
841    <S {Martius}.> I sometime lay here in {Corioles},
842    At a poore mans house: he vs'd me kindly,
843    He cry'd to me: I saw him Prisoner:
844    But then {Auffidius} was within my view,
845    And Wrath o're- whelm'd my pittie: I request you
846    To giue my poore Host freedome.
847    <S {Com}.> Oh  well begg'd:
848    Were he the Butcher of my Sonne, he should
849    Be free, as is the Winde: deliuer him, {Titus}.
850    <S {Lartius}.> {Martius}, his Name.
851    <S {Martius}.> By {Iupiter} forgot:
852    I am wearie, yea, my memorie is tyr'd:
853    Haue we no Wine here?
854    <S {Com}.> Goe we to our Tent:
855    The bloud vpon your Visage dryes, 'tis time
856    It should be lookt #too: come.  <D {Exeunt}.>
857    <D {A flourish. Cornets. Enter Tullus Auffidius}
858    {bloudie, with two or three Souldiors}.>
859    <S {Auffi}.> The Towne is ta'ne.
860    <S {Sould}.> 'Twill be deliuer'd backe on good Condition.
861    <S {Auffid}.> Condition?
862    I would I were a Roman, for I cannot,
863    Being a {Volce}, be that I am. Condition?
864    What good Condition can a Treatie finde
865    I'th' part that is at mercy? fiue times, {Martius},
866    I haue fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me:
867    And would'st doe so, I thinke, should we encounter
      <P aa4v><C B>
868    As often as we eate. By th' Elements,
869    If ere againe I meet him beard to beard,
870    He's mine, or I am his: Mine Emulation
871    Hath not that Honor in't it had: For where
872    I thought to crush him in an equall Force,
873    True Sword to Sword: Ile potche at him some way,
874    Or Wrath, or Craft may get him.
875    <S {Sol}.> He's the diuell.
876   *<S {Auf}.> Bolder, though not so subtle: my valors poison'd,
877    With onely suff'ring staine by him: for him
878    Shall flye out of it selfe, nor sleepe, nor sanctuary,
879    Being naked, sicke; nor Phane, nor Capitoll,
880    The Prayers of Priests, nor times of Sacrifice:
881    Embarquements all of Fury, shall lift vp
882    Their rotten Priuiledge, and Custome 'gainst
883    My hate to {Martius}. Where I finde him, were it
884    At home, vpon my Brothers Guard, euen there
885    Against the hospitable Canon, would I
886    Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' Citie,
887    Learne how 'tis held, and what they are that must
888    Be Hostages for Rome.
889    <S {Soul}.> Will not you go?
890   *<S {Auf}.> I am attended at the Cyprus groue. I pray you
891    ('Tis South the City Mils) bring me word thither
892    How the world goes: that to the pace of it
893    I may spurre on my iourney.
894    <S {Soul}.> I shall sir.
895    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
896    <D {Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the}
897    {people, Sicinius & Brutus}.>
898   *<S {Men}.> The Agurer tels me, wee shall haue Newes to
899    night.
900    <S {Bru}.> Good or bad?
901   *<S {Men}.> Not according to the prayer of the people, for
902    they loue not {Martius}.
903    <S {Sicin}.> Nature teaches Beasts to know their Friends.
904    <S {Men}.> Pray you, who does the Wolfe loue?
905    <S {Sicin}.> The Lambe.
906   *<S {Men}.> #I, to deuour him, as the hungry Plebeians would
907    the Noble {Martius}.
908    <S {Bru}.> He's a Lambe indeed, that baes like a Beare.
909   *<S {Men}.> Hee's a Beare indeede, that liues like a Lambe.
910   *You two are old men, tell me one thing that I shall aske
911    you.
912    <S {Both}.> Well sir.
913   *<S {Men}.> In what enormity is {Martius} poore in, that you
914    two haue not in abundance?
915    <S {Bru}.> He's poore in no one fault, but stor'd withall.
916    <S {Sicin}.> Especially in Pride.
917    <S {Bru}.> And topping all others in boasting.
918   *<S {Men}.> This is strange now: Do you two know, how
919   *you are censured heere in the City, I mean of vs a'th' right
920    hand File, do you?
921    <S {Both}.> Why? how are we censur'd?
922   *<S {Men}.> Because you talke of Pride now, will you not
923    be angry.
924    <S {Both}.> Well, well sir, well.
925   *<S {Men}.> Why 'tis no great matter: for a very little theefe
926   *of Occasion, will rob you of a great deale of Patience:
927   *Giue your dispositions the reines, and bee angry at your
928   *pleasures (at the least) if you take it as a pleasure to you, in
929    being so: you blame {Martius} for being proud.
930    <S {Brut}.> We do it not alone, sir.
931   *<S {Men}.> I know you can doe very little alone, for your
932   *helpes are many, or else your actions would growe won-drous
933   *single: your abilities are #to Infant- like, for dooing
934   *much alone. You talke of Pride: Oh, that you could turn
935   *your eyes toward the Napes of your neckes, and make
936   *but an Interiour suruey of your good selues. Oh that you
937    could.
938    <S {Both}.> What then sir?
939   *<S {Men}.> Why then you should discouer a brace of vn-meriting,
940   *proud, violent, testie Magistrates (alias Fooles)
941    as any in Rome.
942    <S {Sicin}.> {Menenius}, you are knowne well enough too.
943   *<S {Men}.> I am knowne to be a humorous  {Patritian}, and
944   *one that loues a cup of hot Wine, with not a drop of alay-ing
945   *Tiber in't: Said, to be something imperfect in fauou-ring
946   *the first complaint, hasty and Tinder- like vppon, #to
947   *triuiall motion: One, that conuerses more with the But-tocke
948   *of the night, then with the forhead of the morning.
949   *What I think, I vtter, and spend my malice in my breath.
950   *Meeting two such Weales men as you are (I cannot call
951   *you {Licurgusses},) if the drinke you giue me, touch my Pa-lat
952   *aduersly, I make a crooked face at it, I can say, your
953   *Worshippes haue deliuer'd the matter well, when I finde
954   *the Asse in compound, with the Maior part of your sylla-bles.
955   *And though I must be content to beare with those,
956   *that say you are reuerend graue men, yet they lye deadly,
957   *that tell you haue good faces, if you see this in the Map
958   *of my Microcosme, followes it that I am knowne well e-nough
959   *too? What harme can your beesome Conspectui-ties
960   *gleane out of this Charracter, if I be knowne well e-nough
961    too.
962    <S {Bru}.> Come sir come, we know  you well enough.
963   *<S {Menen}.> You know neither mee, your selues, nor any
964   *thing: you are ambitious, for poore knaues cappes and
965   *legges: you weare out a good wholesome Forenoone, in
966   *hearing a cause betweene an Orendge wife, and a Forfet-seller,
967   *and then reiourne the Controuersie of three- pence
968   *to a second day of Audience. When you are hearing a
969   *matter betweene party and party, if you chaunce to bee
970   *pinch'd with the Collike, you make faces like Mum-mers,
971   *set vp the bloodie Flagge against all Patience, and
972   *in roaring for a Chamber- pot, dismisse the Controuersie
973   *bleeding, the more intangled by your hearing: All the
974   *peace you make in their Cause, is calling both the parties
975    Knaues. You are a payre of strange ones.
976   *<S {Bru}.> Come, come, you are well vnderstood to bee a
977   *perfecter gyber for the Table, then a necessary Bencher in
978    the Capitoll.
979   *<S {Men}.> Our very Priests must become Mockers, if they
980   *shall encounter such ridiculous Subiects as you are, when
981   *you speake best vnto the purpose. It is not woorth the
982   *wagging of your Beards, and your Beards deserue not so
983   *honourable a graue, as to stuffe a Botchers Cushion, or to
984   *be intomb'd in an Asses Packe- saddle; yet you must bee
985   *saying, {Martius} is proud: who in a cheape estimation, is
986   *worth all your predecessors, since {Deucalion}, though per-aduenture
987   *some of the best of 'em were hereditarie hang-men.
988   *Godden to your Worships, more of your conuer-sation
989   *would infect my Braine, being the Heardsmen of
990   *the Beastly Plebeans. I will be bold to take my leaue of
991    you.
992    <D {#Bru. and Scic}.  {Aside}.>
      <P aa5><C A>
993    <D {Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria}.>
994   *How now (my as faire as Noble) Ladyes, and the Moone
995   *were shee Earthly, no Nobler; whither doe you follow
996    your Eyes so fast?
997   *<S {Volum}.> Honorable {Menenius}, my Boy {Martius} appro-ches:
998    for the loue of {Iuno} let's goe.
999    <S {Menen}.> Ha? {Martius} comming home?
1000  *<S {Volum}.> #I, worthy {Menenius}, and with most prosperous
1001   approbation.
1002   <S {Menen}.> Take my Cappe {Iupiter}, and I thanke thee:
1003   hoo, {Martius} comming home?
1004   <S 2.{Ladies}.> Nay, 'tis true.
1005  *<S {Volum}.> Looke, here's a Letter from him, the State hath
1006  *another, his Wife another, and (I thinke) there's one at
1007   home for you.
1008  *<S {Menen}.> I will make my very house reele to night:
1009   A Letter for me?
1010   <S {Virgil}.> Yes certaine, there's a Letter for you, I saw't.
1011  *<S {Menen}.> A Letter for me? it giues me an Estate of se-uen
1012  *yeeres health; in which time, I will make a Lippe at
1013  *the Physician: The most soueraigne Prescription in {Galen},
1014  *is but Emperickqutique;  and to this Preseruatiue, of no
1015  *better report then a Horse- drench. Is he not wounded?
1016   he was wont to come home wounded?
1017   <S {Virgil}.> Oh no, no, no.
1018   <S {Volum}.> Oh, he is wounded, I thanke the Gods for't.
1019  *<S {Menen}.> So doe I too, if it be not too much: brings #a
1020   Victorie in his Pocket? the wounds become him.
1021  *<S {Volum}.> On's Browes: {Menenius}, hee comes the third
1022   time home with the Oaken Garland.
1023   <S {Menen}.> Ha's he disciplin'd {Auffidius} soundly?
1024  *<S {Volum}.> {Titus Lartius} writes, they fought together, but
1025   {Auffidius} got off.
1026  *<S {Menen}.> And 'twas time for him too, Ile warrant him
1027  *that: #and he had stay'd by him, I would not haue been so
1028  *fiddious'd, for all the Chests in Carioles, and the Gold
1029   that's in them. Is the Senate possest of this?
1030  *<S {Volum}.> Good Ladies let's goe. Yes, yes, yes: The
1031  *Senate ha's Letters from the Generall, wherein hee giues
1032  *my Sonne the whole Name of the Warre: he hath in this
1033   action out- done his former deeds doubly.
1034  *<S {Valer}.> In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
1035  *<S {Menen}.> Wondrous: #I, I warrant you, and not with-out
1036   his true purchasing.
1037   <S {Virgil}.> The Gods graunt them true.
1038   <S {Volum}.> True? pow waw.
1039  *<S {Mene}.> True? Ile be sworne they are true: where is
1040  *hee wounded, God saue your good Worships? {Martius}
1041  *is comming home: hee ha's more cause to be prowd:
1042   where is he wounded?
1043  *<S {Volum}.> Ith' Shoulder, and ith' left Arme: there will be
1044  *large Cicatrices to shew the People, when hee shall stand
1045  *for his place: he receiued in the repulse of {Tarquin} seuen
1046   hurts ith' Body.
1047  *<S {Mene}.> One ith' Neck, and two ith' Thigh, there's nine
1048   that I know.
1049  *<S {Volum}.> Hee had, before this last Expedition, twentie
1050   fiue Wounds vpon him.
1051  *<S {Mene}.> Now it's twentie seuen;  euery gash was an
1052   Enemies Graue. Hearke, the Trumpets.
1053   <D {A showt, and flourish}.>
1054   <S {Volum}.> These are the Vshers of {Martius}:
1055   Before him, hee carryes Noyse;
1056   And behinde him, hee leaues Teares:
1057   Death, that darke Spirit, in's neruie Arme doth lye,
1058   Which being aduanc'd, declines, and then men dye.

1077   My gentle {Martius}, worthy {Caius},
1078   And by deed- atchieuing  Honor newly nam'd,
1079   What is it ({Coriolanus}) must I call thee?
1080   But oh, thy Wife.
1081   <S {Corio}.> My gracious silence, hayle:
1082   Would'st thou haue laugh'd, had I come Coffin'd home,
1083   That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah my deare,
1084   Such eyes the Widowes in Carioles #were,
1085   And Mothers that lacke Sonnes.
1086   <S {Mene}.> Now the Gods Crowne thee.
1087   <S {Com}.> And liue you yet? Oh my sweet Lady, pardon.
1088   <S {Volum}.> I know not where to turne.
1089   Oh  welcome home: and welcome Generall,
1090   And y'are welcome all.
1091   <S {Mene}.> A hundred thousand Welcomes:
1092   I could weepe, and I could laugh,
1093   I am light, and heauie; welcome:
1094   A Curse  begin at very root on's heart,
1095   That is not glad to see thee.
1096   You are three, that Rome should dote on:
1097   Yet by the faith of men, we haue
1098   Some old Crab- trees here at home,
1099   That will not be grafted to your Rallish.
1100   Yet welcome Warriors:
1101   Wee call a Nettle, but a Nettle;
1102   And the faults of fooles, but folly.
1103   <S {Com}.> Euer right.
1104   <S {Cor}.> {Menenius}, euer, euer.
1105   <S {Herauld}.> Giue way there, and goe on.
1106   <S {Cor}.> Your Hand, and yours?
1107   Ere in our owne house I doe shade my Head,
1108   The good Patricians must be visited,
1109   From whom I haue receiu'd not onely greetings,
1110   But with them, change of Honors.
1111   <S {Volum}.> I haue liued,
1112   To see inherited my very Wishes,
1113   And the Buildings of my Fancie:
1114   Onely there's one thing wanting,
1115   Which (I doubt not) but our Rome
1116   Will cast vpon thee.
1117   <S {Cor}.> Know, good Mother,
1118   I had rather be their seruant in my way,
1119   Then sway with them in theirs.
1120   <S {Com}.> On, to the Capitall.  <D {Flourish. Cornets}.>
1121   <D {Exeunt in State,  as before}.>
      <P aa5v>
1122   <D {Enter Brutus and Scicinius}>.
1123  *<S {Bru}.> All tongues speake of him, and the bleared sights
1124   Are spectacled to see him. Your pratling Nurse
1125   Into a rapture lets her Baby crie,
1126   While she chats him: the Kitchin {Malkin} pinnes
1127   Her richest Lockram 'bout her reechie necke,
1128   Clambring the Walls to eye him:
1129   Stalls, Bulkes, Windowes, are smother'd vp,
1130   Leades fill'd, and Ridges hors'd
1131   With variable Complexions; all agreeing
1132   In earnestnesse to see him: seld- showne Flamins
1133   Doe presse among the popular Throngs, and puffe
1134   To winne a vulgar station: our veyl'd Dames
1135   Commit the Warre of White and Damaske
1136   In their nicely gawded Cheekes, toth' wanton spoyle
1137   Of {Phoebus} burning Kisses: such a  poother,
1138   As if that whatsoeuer God, who leades him,
1139   Were slyly crept into his humane powers,
1140   And gaue him gracefull posture.
1141   <S {Scicin}.> On the suddaine, I warrant him Consull.
1142  *<S {Brutus}.> Then our Office may, during his power, goe
1143   sleepe.
1144   <S {Scicin}.> He cannot temp'rately transport his Honors,
1145   From where he should begin, and end, but will
1146   Lose those he hath wonne.
1147   <S {Brutus}.> In that there's comfort.
1148   <S {Scici}.> Doubt not,
1149   The Commoners, for whom we stand, but they
1150   Vpon their ancient mallice, will forget
1151   With the least cause, these his new Honors,
1152   Which that he will giue them, make I as little question,
1153   As  he is prowd to doo't.
1154   <S {Brutus}.> I heard him sweare,
1155   Were he to stand for Consull, neuer would he
1156   Appeare i'th' Market place, nor on him put
1157   The Naples Vesture of Humilitie,
1158   Nor shewing (as the manner is) his Wounds
1159   Toth' People, begge their stinking Breaths.
1160   <S {Scicin}.> 'Tis right.
1161   <S {Brutus}.> It was his word:
1162   Oh he would misse it, rather then carry it,
1163   But by the suite of the Gentry to him,
1164   And the desire of the Nobles.
1165  *<S {Scicin}.> I wish no better, then haue him hold that pur-pose,
1166   and to put it in execution.
1167   <S {Brutus}.> 'Tis most like he will.
1168  *<S {Scicin}.> It shall be to him then, as our good wills; a
1169   sure destruction.
1170   <S {Brutus}.> So it must fall out
1171   To him, or our Authorities, for an end.
1172   We must suggest the People, in what hatred
1173   He still hath held them: that to's power he would
1174   Haue made them Mules, silenc'd their Pleaders,
1175   And dispropertied their Freedomes; holding them,
1176   In humane Action, and Capacitie,
1177   Of no more Soule, nor fitnesse for the World,
1178   Then Cammels in their Warre, who haue their Prouand
1179   Onely for bearing Burthens, and sore blowes
1180   For sinking vnder them.
1181   <S {Scicin}.> This (as you say) suggested,
1182   At some time, when his soaring Insolence
1183   Shall teach the People, which time shall not want,
1184   If he be put vpon't, and that's as easie,
1185   As to set Dogges on Sheepe, will be his fire
1186   To kindle their dry Stubble: and their Blaze
1187   Shall darken him for euer.
1188   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1189   <S {Brutus}.> What's the matter?
1190   <S {Mess}.> You are sent for to the Capitoll:
1191   'Tis thought, that {Martius} shall be Consull:
1192   I haue seene the dumbe men throng to see him,
1193  *And the blind to heare him speak: Matrons flong Gloues,
1194   Ladies and Maids their Scarffes, and Handkerchers,
1195   Vpon him as he pass'd: the Nobles bended
1196   As to {Ioues} Statue, and the Commons made
1197   A Shower, and Thunder, with their Caps, and Showts:
1198   I neuer saw the like.
1199   <S {Brutus}.> Let's to the Capitoll,
1200   And carry with vs Eares and Eyes for th' time,
1201   But Hearts for the euent.
1202   <S {Scicin}.> Haue with you.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1203   <D {Enter two Officers, to lay Cushions, as it were},
1204   {in the Capitoll}.>
1205  *<S 1.{Off}.> Come, come, they are almost here: how many
1206   stand for Consulships?
1207  *<S 2.{Off}.> Three, they say: but 'tis thought of euery one,
1208   {Coriolanus} will carry it.
1209  *<S 1.{Off}.> That's a braue fellow: but hee's vengeance
1210   prowd, and loues not the common people.
1211  *<S 2.{Off}.> 'Faith, there hath beene many great men that
1212  *haue flatter'd the people, who ne're loued them; and there
1213  *be many that they haue loued, they know not wherefore:
1214  *so that if they loue they know not why, they hate vpon
1215  *no better a ground. Therefore, for {Coriolanus} neyther to
1216  *care whether they loue, or hate him, manifests the true
1217  *knowledge he ha's in their disposition, and out of his No-ble
1218   carelesnesse lets them plainely see't.
1219  *<S 1.{Off}.> If he did not care whether he had their loue, or
1220  *no, hee waued indifferently, 'twixt doing them neyther
1221  *good, nor harme: but hee seekes their hate with greater
1222  *deuotion, then they can render it him; and leaues nothing
1223  *vndone, that may fully discouer him their opposite. Now
1224  *to seeme to affect the mallice and displeasure of the Peo-ple,
1225  *is as bad, as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for
1226   their loue.
1227  *<S 2.{Off}.> Hee hath deserued worthily of his Countrey,
1228  *and his assent is not by such easie degrees as those, who
1229  *hauing beene supple and courteous to the People, Bon-netted,
1230  *without any further deed, to haue them at all into
1231  *their estimation, and report: but hee hath so planted his
1232  *Honors in their Eyes, and his actions in their Hearts, that
1233  *for their Tongues to be silent, and not confesse so much,
1234  *were a kinde of ingratefull Iniurie: to report otherwise,
1235  *were a Mallice, that giuing it selfe the Lye, would plucke
1236   reproofe and rebuke from euery Eare that heard it.
1237  *<S 1.{Off}.> No more of him, hee's a worthy man: make
1238   way, they are comming.
1239   <D {A Sennet. Enter the Patricians, and the Tribunes of}
1240   {the People, Lictors before them: Coriolanus, Mene-nius},
1241   {Cominius the Consul: Scicinius and Brutus}
1242   {take their places by themselues: Corio-lanus}
1243   {stands}.>
1244   <S {Menen}.> Hauing determin'd of the Volces,
1245   And to send for {Titus Lartius}: it remaines,
1246   As the maine Point of this our after- meeting,
      <P aa6>
1247   To gratifie his Noble seruice, that hath
1248   Thus stood for his Countrey. Therefore please you,
1249   Most reuerend and graue Elders, to desire
1250   The present Consull, and last Generall,
1251   In our well- found Successes, to report
1252   A little of that worthy Worke, perform'd
1253   By {Martius Caius Coriolanus}: whom
1254   We met here, both to thanke, and to remember,
1255   With Honors like himselfe.
1256   <S 1.{Sen}.> Speake, good {Cominius}:
1257   Leaue nothing out for length, and make vs thinke
1258   Rather our states defectiue for requitall,
1259   Then we to stretch it out. Masters a'th' People,
1260   We doe request your kindest eares: and after
1261   Your louing motion toward the common Body,
1262   To yeeld what passes here.
1263  *<S {Scicin}.> We are conuented vpon a pleasing Treatie, and
1264  *haue hearts inclinable to honor and aduance the Theame
1265   of our Assembly.
1266  *<S {Brutus}.> Which the rather wee shall be blest to doe, if
1267  *he remember a kinder value of the People, then he hath
1268   hereto priz'd them at.
1269  *<S {Menen}.> That's off, that's off: I would you rather had
1270   been silent: Please you to heare {Cominius} speake?
1271  *<S {Brutus}.> Most willingly: but yet my Caution was
1272   more pertinent then the rebuke you giue it.
1273  *<S {Menen}.> He loues your People, but tye him not to be
1274   their Bed- fellow: Worthie {Cominius} speake.
1275   <D {Coriolanus rises, and offers to goe away}.>
1276   Nay, keepe your place.
1277   <S {Senat}.> Sit {Coriolanus}: neuer shame to heare
1278   What you haue Nobly done.
1279   <S {Coriol}.> Your Honors pardon:
1280   I had rather haue my Wounds to heale againe,
1281   Then heare say how I got them.
1282   <S {Brutus}.> Sir, I hope my words dis- bench'd you not?
1283   <S {Coriol}.> No Sir: yet oft,
1284   When blowes haue made me stay, I fled from words.
1285   You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not: but your People,
1286   I loue them as they weigh===
1287   <S {Menen}.> Pray now sit downe.
1288  *<S {Corio}.> I had rather haue one scratch my Head i'th' Sun,
1289   When the Alarum were strucke, then idly sit
1290   To heare my Nothings monster'd.  <D {Exit Coriolanus}>
1291   <S {Menen}.> Masters of the People,
1292   Your multiplying Spawne, how can he flatter?
1293   That's thousand to one good one, when you now see
1294   He had rather venture all his Limbes for Honor,
1295   Then on ones Eares to heare it. Proceed {Cominius}.
1296   <S {Com}.> I shall lacke voyce: the deeds of {Coriolanus}
1297   Should not be vtter'd feebly: it is held,
1298   That Valour is the chiefest Vertue,
1299   And most dignifies the hauer: if it be,
1300   The man I speake of, cannot in the World
1301   Be singly counter- poys'd. At sixteene yeeres,
1302   When {Tarquin} made a Head for Rome, he fought
1303   Beyond the marke of others: our then Dictator,
1304   Whom with all prayse I point at, saw him fight,
1305   When with his Amazonian Shinne he droue
1306   The brizled Lippes before him: he bestrid
1307   An o're- prest Roman, and i'th' Consuls view
1308   Slew three Opposers: {Tarquins} selfe he met,
1309   And strucke him on his Knee: in that dayes feates,
1310   When he might act the Woman in the Scene,
1311   He prou'd best man i'th' field, and for his meed
1312   Was Brow- bound with the Oake. His Pupill age
1313   Man- entred thus, he waxed like a Sea,
1314   And in the brunt of seuenteene Battailes since,
1315   He lurcht all Swords of the Garland: for this last,
1316   Before, and in Corioles, let me say
1317   I cannot speake him home: he stopt the flyers,
1318   And by his rare example made the Coward
1319   Turne terror into sport: as Weeds before
1320   A Vessell vnder sayle, so men obey'd,
1321   And fell below his Stem: his Sword, Deaths stampe,
1322   Where it did marke, it tooke from face to foot:
1323   He was a thing of Blood, whose euery motion
1324   Was tim'd with dying Cryes: alone he entred
1325   The mortall Gate of th' Citie, which he painted
1326   With shunlesse destinie: aydelesse came off,
1327   And with a sudden re- inforcement strucke
1328   Carioles like a Planet: now all's his,
1329   When #by and by the dinne of Warre gan pierce
1330   His readie sence: then straight his doubled spirit
1331   Requickned what in flesh was fatigate,
1332   And to the Battaile came he, where he did
1333   Runne reeking o're the liues of men, as if 'twere
1334   A perpetuall spoyle: and till we call'd
1335   Both Field and Citie ours, he neuer stood
1336   To ease his Brest with panting.
1337   <S {Menen}.> Worthy man.
1338  *<S {Senat}.> He cannot but with measure fit the Honors
1339   which we deuise him.
1340   <S {Com}.> Our spoyles he kickt at,
1341   And look'd vpon things precious, as they were
1342   The common Muck of the World: he couets lesse
1343   Then Miserie it selfe would giue, rewards his deeds
1344   With doing them, and is content
1345   To spend the time, to end it.
1346   <S {Menen}.> Hee's right Noble, let him be call'd for.
1347   <S {Senat}.> Call {Coriolanus}.
1348   <S {Off}.> He doth appeare.
1349   <D {Enter Coriolanus}.>
1350  *<S {Menen}.> The Senate, {Coriolanus}, are well pleas'd to make
1351   thee Consull.
1352   <S {Corio}.> I doe owe them still my Life, and Seruices.
1353  *<S {Menen}.> It then remaines, that you doe speake to the
1354   People.
1355   <S {Corio}.> I doe beseech you,
1356   Let me o're- leape that custome: for I cannot
1357   Put on the Gowne, stand naked, and entreat them
1358   For my Wounds sake, to giue their sufferage:
1359   Please you that I may passe this doing.
1360   <S {Scicin}.> Sir, the People must haue their Voyces,
1361   Neyther  will they bate one iot of Ceremonie.
1362   <S {Menen}.> Put them not too't:
1363   Pray you goe fit you to the Custome,
1364   And take to you, as your Predecessors haue,
1365   Your Honor with your forme.
1366   <S {Corio}.> It is a part that I shall blush in acting,
1367   And might well be taken from the People.
1368   <S {Brutus}.> Marke you that.
1369   <S {Corio}.> To brag vnto them, thus I did, and thus
1370   Shew them th' vnaking Skarres, which I should hide,
1371   As if I had receiu'd them for the hyre
1372   Of their breath onely.
1373   <S {Menen}.> Doe not stand vpon't:
1374   We recommend to you Tribunes of the People
1375   Our purpose to them, and to our Noble Consull
1376   Wish we all Ioy, and Honor.
      <P aa6v><C B>
1377   <S {Senat}.> To {Coriolanus} come all ioy and Honor.
1378   <D {Flourish Cornets}.
1379   {Then Exeunt. Manet Sicinius and Brutus}.>
1380   <S {Bru}.> You see how he intends to vse the people.
1381  *<S {Scicin}.> May they perceiue's intent: he wil require them
1382   As if he did contemne what he requested,
1383   Should be in them to giue.
1384   <S {Bru}.> Come, wee'l informe them
1385   Of our proceedings heere on th' Market place,
1386   I know they do attend vs.
1387   <D {Enter seuen or eight Citizens}.>
1388  *<S 1.{Cit}.> Once if he do require our voyces, wee ought
1389   not to deny him.
1390   <S 2.{Cit}.> We may Sir if we will.
1391  *<S 3.{Cit}.> We haue power in our selues to do it, but it is
1392  *a power that we haue no power to do: For, if hee shew vs
1393  *his wounds, and tell vs his deeds, we are to put our ton-gues
1394  *into  those wounds, and speake for them: So if he tel
1395  *vs his Noble deeds, we must also tell him our Noble ac-ceptance
1396  *of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the
1397  *multitude to be ingratefull, were to make a Monster of
1398  *the multitude; of the which, we being members, should
1399   bring our selues to be monstrous members.
1400  *<S 1.{Cit}.> And to make vs no better thought of a little
1401  *helpe will serue: for once we stood vp about the Corne,
1402  *he himselfe stucke not to call vs the many- headed Multi-tude.
1403  _
1404  *<S 3.{Cit}.> We haue beene call'd so of many, not that our
1405  *heads are some browne, some blacke, some Abram, some
1406  *bald; but that our wits are so diuersly Coulord; and true-ly
1407  *I thinke, if all our wittes were to issue out of one Scull,
1408  *they would flye East, West, North, South, and their con-sent
1409  *of one direct way, should be at once to all the points
1410   a'th Compasse.
1411  *<S 2.{Cit}.> Thinke you so? Which way do you iudge my
1412   wit would flye.
1413  *<S 3.{Cit}.> Nay your wit will not so soone out as another
1414  *mans will, 'tis strongly wadg'd vp in a blocke- head: but
1415   if it were at liberty, 'twould sure Southward.
1416   <S 2 {Cit}.> Why that way?
1417  *<S 3 {Cit}.> To loose it selfe in a Fogge, where being three
1418  *parts melted away with rotten Dewes, the fourth would
1419  *returne for Conscience sake, to helpe to get thee a Wife.
1420  *<S 2 {Cit}.> You are neuer without your trickes, you may,
1421   you may.
1422  *<S 3 {Cit}.> Are you all resolu'd to giue your voyces? But
1423  *that's no matter, the greater part carries it, I say. If hee
1424  *would incline to the people, there was neuer a worthier
1425   man.
1426   <D {Enter Coriolanus in a gowne of Humility, with}
1427   {Menenius}.>
1428  *Heere he comes, and in the Gowne of humility, marke
1429  *his behauiour: we are not to stay altogether, but to come
1430  *by him where he stands, by ones, by twoes, & by threes.
1431  *He's to make his requests by particulars, wherein euerie
1432  *one of vs ha's a single Honor, in giuing him our own voi-ces
1433  *with our owne tongues, therefore follow me, and Ile
1434   direct you how you shall go by him.
1435   <S {All}.> Content, content.
1436  *<S {Men}.> Oh Sir, you are not right: haue you not knowne
1437   The worthiest men haue done't?
1438   <S {Corio}.> What must I say, I pray Sir?
1439   Plague vpon't, I cannot bring
1440   My tongue to such a pace. Looke Sir, my wounds,
1441   I got them in my Countries Seruice, when
1442   Some certaine of your Brethren roar'd, and ranne
1443   From th' noise of our owne Drummes.
1444  *<S {Menen}.> Oh me the Gods, you must not speak of that,
1445   You must desire them to thinke vpon you.
1446   <S {Coriol}.> Thinke vpon me? Hang 'em,
1447   I would they would forget me, like the Vertues
1448   Which our Diuines lose by em.
1449   <S {Men}.> You'l marre all,
1450   Ile leaue you: Pray you speake to em, I pray you
1451   In wholsome manner.  <D {Exit}>
1452   <D {Enter three of the Citizens}.>
1453   <S {Corio}.> Bid them wash their Faces,
1454   And keepe their teeth cleane: So, heere comes a brace,
1455   You know the cause (Sir) of my standing heere.
1456  *<S 3 {Cit}.> We do Sir, tell vs what hath brought you too't.
1457   <S {Corio}.> Mine owne desert.
1458   <S 2 {Cit}.> Your owne desert.
1459   <S {Corio}.> #I, but mine owne desire.
1460   <S 3 {Cit}.> How not your owne desire?
1461  *<S {Corio}.> No Sir, 'twas neuer my desire yet to trouble the
1462   poore with begging.
1463  *<S 3 {Cit}.> You must thinke if we giue you any thing, we
1464   hope to gaine by you.
1465   <S {Corio}.> Well then I pray, your price a'th' Consulship.
1466   <S 1 {Cit}.> The price is, to aske it kindly.
1467  *<S {Corio}.> Kindly sir, I pray let me ha't: I haue wounds to
1468  *shew you, which shall bee yours in priuate: your good
1469   voice sir, what say you?
1470   <S 2 {Cit}.> You shall ha't worthy Sir.
1471  *<S {Corio}.> A match Sir, there's in all two worthie voyces
1472   begg'd: I haue your Almes, Adieu.
1473   <S 3 {Cit}.> But this is something odde.
1474   <S 2 {Cit}.> And 'twere to giue againe: but 'tis no matter.
1475   <D {Exeunt}. {Enter two other Citizens}.>
1476  *<S {Coriol}.> Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune
1477  *of your voices, that I may bee Consull, I haue heere the
1478   Customarie Gowne.
1479  *<S 1.> You haue deserued Nobly of your Countrey, and
1480   you haue not deserued Nobly.
1481   <S {Coriol}.> Your Aenigma.
1482  *<S 1.> You haue bin a scourge to her enemies, you haue
1483  *bin a  Rod to her Friends, you haue not indeede loued the
1484   Common people.
1485  *<S {Coriol}.> You should account mee the more Vertuous,
1486  *that I haue not bin common in my Loue, I will sir flatter
1487  *my sworne Brother the people to earne a deerer estima-tion
1488  *of them, 'tis a condition they account gentle: & since
1489  *the wisedome of their choice, is rather to haue my Hat,
1490  *then my Heart, I will practice the insinuating nod, and be
1491  *off to them most counterfetly, that is sir, I will counter-fet
1492  *the bewitchment of some popular man, and giue it
1493  *bountifull to the desirers: Therefore beseech you, I may
1494   be Consull.
1495  *<S 2.> Wee hope to finde you our friend: and therefore
1496   giue you our voices heartily.
1497  *<S 1.> You haue receyued many wounds for your Coun-trey.
1498  _
1499  *<S {Coriol}.> I wil not Seale your knowledge with shewing
1500  *them. I will make much of your voyces, and so trouble
1501   you no farther.
1502   <S {Both}.> The Gods giue you ioy Sir heartily.
1503   <S {Coriol}.> Most sweet Voyces:
1504   Better it is to dye, better to sterue,
1505   Then craue the higher, which first we do deserue.
1506   Why in this Wooluish tongue should I stand heere,
1507   To begge of Hob and Dicke, that does appeere
      <P bb1><C A>
1508   Their needlesse Vouches: Custome calls me too't.
1509   What Custome wills in all things, should we doo't?
1510   The Dust on antique Time would lye vnswept,
1511   And mountainous Error be too highly heapt,
1512   For Truth to o're- peere. Rather then foole it so,
1513   Let the high Office and the Honor go
1514   To one that would doe thus. I am halfe through,
1515   The one part suffered, the other will I doe.
1516   <D {Enter three Citizens more}.>
1517   Here come moe Voyces.
1518   Your Voyces? for your Voyces I haue sought,
1519   Watcht for your Voyces: for your Voyces, beare
1520   Of Wounds, two dozen odde: Battailes thrice six
1521   I haue seene, and heard of: for your Voyces,
1522   Haue done many things, some lesse, some more:
1523   Your Voyces? Indeed I would be Consull.
1524  *<S 1.{Cit}.> Hee ha's done Nobly, and cannot goe without
1525   any honest mans Voyce.
1526  *<S 2.{Cit}.> Therefore let him be Consull: the Gods giue him
1527   ioy, and make him good friend to the People.
1528   <S {All}.> Amen, Amen. God saue thee, Noble Consull.
1529   <S {Corio}.> Worthy Voyces.
1530   <D {Enter Menenius, with Brutus and Scicinius}.>
1531   <S {Mene}.> You haue stood your Limitation:
1532   And the Tribunes endue you with the Peoples Voyce,
1533   Remaines, that in th' Officiall Markes inuested,
1534   You anon doe meet the Senate.
1535   <S {Corio}.> Is this done?
1536   <S {Scicin}.> The Custome of Request you haue discharg'd:
1537   The People doe admit you, and are summon'd
1538   To meet anon, vpon your approbation.
1539   <S {Corio}.> Where? at the Senate- house?
1540   <S {Scicin}.> There, {Coriolanus}.
1541   <S {Corio}.> May I change these Garments?
1542   <S {Scicin}.> You may, Sir.
1543  *<S {Cori}.> That Ile straight do: and knowing my selfe again,
1544   Repayre toth' Senate-house.
1545   <S {Mene}.> Ile keepe you company. Will you along?
1546   <S {Brut}.>  We stay here for the People.
1547   <S {Scicin}.> Fare you well.  <D {Exeunt Coriol. and Mene}.>
1548   He ha's it now: and by his Lookes, me thinkes,
1549   'Tis warme at's heart.
1550  *<S {Brut}.> With a prowd heart he wore his humble Weeds:
1551   Will you dismisse the People?
1552   <D {Enter the Plebeians}.>
1553  *<S {Scici}.> How now, my Masters, haue you chose this man?
1554   <S 1.{Cit}.> He ha's our Voyces, Sir.
1555   <S {Brut}.> We pray the Gods, he may deserue your loues.
1556   <S 2.{Cit}.> Amen, Sir: to my poore vnworthy notice,
1557   He mock'd vs, when he begg'd our Voyces.
1558   <S 3.{Cit}.> Certainely, he flowted vs downe- right.
1559   <S 1.{Cit}.> No, 'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock vs.
1560   <S 2.{Cit}.> Not one amongst vs, saue your selfe, but sayes
1561   He vs'd vs scornefully: he should haue shew'd vs
1562   His Marks of Merit, Wounds receiu'd for's Countrey.
1563   <S {Scicin}.> Why so he did, I am sure.
1564   <S {All}.> No, no: no man saw 'em.
1565   <S 3.{Cit}.> Hee said hee had Wounds,
1566   Which he could shew in priuate:
1567   And with his Hat, thus wauing it in scorne,
1568   I would be Consull, sayes he: aged Custome,
1569   But by your Voyces, will not so permit me.
1570   Your Voyces therefore: when we graunted that,
1571   Here was, I thanke you for your Voyces, thanke you
1572  *Your most sweet Voyces: now you haue left your Voyces,
1573   I haue no further with you. Was not this mockerie?
1574   <S {Scicin}.> Why eyther were you ignorant to see't?
1575   Or seeing it, of such Childish friendlinesse,
1576   To yeeld your Voyces?
1577   <S {Brut}.> Could you not haue told him,
1578   As you were lesson'd: When he had no Power,
1579   But was a pettie seruant to the State,
1580   He was your Enemie, euer spake against
1581   Your Liberties, and the Charters that you beare
1582   I'th' Body of the Weale: and now arriuing
1583   A place of Potencie, and sway o'th' State,
1584   If he should still malignantly remaine
1585   Fast Foe toth' {Plebeij}, your Voyces might
1586   Be Curses to your selues. You should haue said,
1587   That as his worthy deeds did clayme no lesse
1588   Then what he stood for: so his gracious nature
1589   Would thinke vpon you, for your Voyces,
1590   And translate his Mallice towards you, into Loue,
1591   Standing your friendly Lord.
1592   <S {Scicin}.> Thus to haue said,
1593   As you were fore- aduis'd, had toucht his Spirit,
1594   And try'd his Inclination: from him pluckt
1595   Eyther his gracious Promise, which you might
1596   As cause had call'd you vp, haue held him to;
1597   Or else it would haue gall'd his surly nature,
1598   Which easily endures not Article,
1599   Tying him to ought, so putting him to Rage,
1600   You should haue ta'ne th' aduantage of his Choller,
1601   And pass'd him vnelected.
1602   <S {Brut}.> Did you perceiue,
1603   He did sollicite you in free Contempt,
1604   When he did need your Loues: and doe you thinke,
1605   That his Contempt shall not be brusing to you,
1606   When he hath power to crush? Why, had your Bodyes
1607   No Heart among you? Or had you Tongues, to cry
1608   Against the Rectorship of Iudgement?
1609   <S {Scicin}.> Haue you, ere now, deny'd the asker:
1610   And now againe, of him that did not aske, but mock,
1611   Bestow your su'd- for Tongues?
1612   <S 3.{Cit}.> Hee's not confirm'd, we may deny him yet.
1613   <S 2.{Cit}.> And will deny him:
1614   Ile haue fiue hundred Voyces of that sound.
1615  *<S 1.{Cit}.> I twice fiue hundred, & their friends, to piece 'em.
1616   <S {Brut}.> Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
1617   They haue chose a Consull, that will from them take
1618   Their Liberties, make them of no more Voyce
1619   Then Dogges, that are as often beat for barking,
1620   As therefore kept to doe so.
1621   <S {Scici}.> Let them assemble: and on a safer Iudgement,
1622   All reuoke your ignorant election: Enforce his Pride,
1623   And his old Hate vnto you: besides, forget not
1624   With what Contempt he wore the humble Weed,
1625   How in his Suit he scorn'd you: but your Loues,
1626   Thinking vpon his Seruices, tooke from you
1627   Th' apprehension of his present portance,
1628   Which most gibingly, vngrauely, he did fashion
1629   After the inueterate Hate he beares you.
1630   <S {Brut}.> Lay a fault on vs, your Tribunes,
1631   That we labour'd (no impediment betweene)
1632   But that you must cast your Election on him.
1633  *<S {Scici}.> Say you chose him, more after our commandment,
1634   Then as guided by your owne true affections, and that
1635  *Your Minds pre- occupy'd with what you rather must do,
1636   Then what you should, made you against the graine
1637   To Voyce him Consull. Lay the fault on vs.
      <P bb1v>
1638   <S {Brut}.> #I, spare vs not: Say, we read Lectures to you,
1639   How youngly he began to serue his Countrey,
1640   How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
1641   The Noble House o'th'{#Martians}: from whence came
1642   That {Ancus Martius}, {Numaes} Daughters Sonne:
1643   Who after great {Hostilius} here was King,
1644   Of the same House {Publius} and {Quintus}  were,
1645   That our best Water, brought by Conduits hither,
1646   And Nobly nam'd, so twice being Censor,
1647   Was his great Ancestor.
1648   <S {Scicin}.> One thus descended,
1649   That hath beside well in his person wrought,
1650   To be set high in place, we did commend
1651   To your remembrances: but you haue found,
1652   Skaling his present bearing with his past,
1653   That hee's your fixed enemie; and reuoke
1654   Your suddaine approbation.
1655   <S {Brut}.> Say you ne're had don't,
1656   (Harpe on that still) but by our putting on:
1657   And presently, when you haue drawne your number,
1658   Repaire toth' Capitoll.
1659   <S {All}.> We will so: almost all repent in their election.
1660   <D {Exeunt Plebeians}.>
1661   <S {Brut}.> Let them goe on:
1662   This Mutinie were better put in hazard,
1663   Then stay past doubt, for greater:
1664   If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
1665   With their refusall, both obserue and answer
1666   The vantage of his anger.
1667   <S {Scicin}.> Toth' Capitoll, come:
1668   We will be there before the streame o'th' People:
1669   And this shall seeme, as partly 'tis, their owne,
1670   Which we haue goaded on- ward.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1671   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1672   <D {Cornets. Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, all the Gentry},
1673   {Cominius, Titus Latius, and other Senators}.>
1674   <S {Corio}.> {Tullus Auffidius} then had made new head.
1675  *<S {Latius}.> He had, my Lord,  and that it was which caus'd
1676   Our swifter Composition.
1677   <S {Corio}.> So then the Volces stand but as at first,
1678   Readie when time shall prompt them, to make roade
1679   Vpon's againe.
1680   <S {Com}.> They are worne (Lord Consull) so,
1681   That we shall hardly in our ages see
1682   Their Banners waue againe.
1683   <S {Corio}.> Saw you {Auffidius}?
1684   <S {Latius}.> On safegard he came to me, and did curse
1685   Against the Volces, for they had so vildly
1686   Yeelded the Towne: he is retyred to Antium.
1687   <S {Corio}.> Spoke he of me?
1688   <S {Latius}.> He did, my Lord.
1689   <S {Corio}.> How? what?
1690  *<S {Latius}.> How often he had met you Sword to Sword:
1691   That of all things vpon the Earth, he hated
1692   Your person most: That he would pawne his fortunes
1693   To hopelesse restitution, so he might
1694   Be call'd your Vanquisher.
1695   <S {Corio}.> At Antium liues he?
1696   <S {Latius}.> At Antium.
1697   <S {Corio}.> I wish I had a cause to seeke him there,
1698   To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
1699   <D {Enter Scicinius and Brutus}.>
1700   Behold, these are the Tribunes of the People,
1701   The Tongues o'th' Common Mouth. I do despise them:
1702   For they doe pranke them in Authoritie,
1703   Against all Noble sufferance.
1704   <S {Scicin}.> Passe no further.
1705   <S {Cor}.> Hah? what is that?
1706   <S {Brut}.> It will be dangerous to goe on=== No further.
1707   <S {Corio}.> What makes this change?
1708   <S {Menen}.> The matter?
1709  *<S {Com}.> Hath he not pass'd the Noble, and the Common?
1710   <S {Brut}.> {Cominius}, no.
1711   <S {Corio}.> Haue I had Childrens Voyces?
1712   <S {Senat}.> Tribunes giue way, he shall toth' Market place.
1713   <S {Brut}.> The People are incens'd against him.
1714   <S {Scicin}.> Stop, or all will fall in broyle.
1715   <S {Corio}.> Are these your Heard?
1716   Must these haue Voyces, that can yeeld them now,
1717  *And straight disclaim their toungs? what are your Offices?
1718  *You being their Mouthes, why rule you not their Teeth?
1719   Haue you not set them on?
1720   <S {Mene}.> Be calme, be calme.
1721   <S {Corio}.> It is a purpos'd thing, and growes by Plot,
1722   To curbe the #will of the Nobilitie:
1723   Suffer't, and liue with such as cannot rule,
1724   Nor euer will be ruled.
1725   <S {Brut}.> Call't not a Plot:
1726   The People cry you mockt them: and of late,
1727   When Corne was giuen them {gratis}, you repin'd,
1728   Scandal'd the Suppliants: for the People, call'd them
1729   Time- pleasers, flatterers, foes to Noblenesse.
1730   <S {Corio}.> Why this was knowne before.
1731   <S {Brut}.> Not to them all.
1732   <S {Corio}.> Haue you inform'd them sithence?
1733   <S {Brut}.> How? I informe them?
1734   <S {Com}.> You are like to doe such businesse.
1735   <S {Brut}.> Not vnlike each way to better yours.
1736  *<S {Corio}.> Why then should I be Consull? by yond Clouds
1737   Let me deserue so #ill as you, and make me
1738   Your fellow Tribune.
1739   <S {Scicin}.> You shew too much of that,
1740   For which the People stirre: if you will passe
1741   To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
1742   Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
1743   Or neuer be so Noble as a Consull,
1744   Nor yoake with him for Tribune.
1745   <S {Mene}.> Let's be calme.
1746   <S {Com}.> The People are abus'd: set on, this paltring
1747   Becomes not Rome: nor ha's {Coriolanus}
1748   Deseru'd this so dishonor'd Rub, layd falsely
1749   I'th' plaine Way of his Merit.
1750   <S {Corio}.> Tell me of Corne: this was my speech,
1751   And I will speak't againe.
1752   <S {Mene}.> Not now, not now.
1753   <S {Senat}.> Not in this heat, Sir, now.
1754   <S {Corio}.> Now as I liue, I will.
1755   My Nobler friends, I craue their pardons:
1756   For the mutable ranke- sented Meynie,
1757   Let them regard me, as I doe not flatter,
1758   And therein behold themselues: I say againe,
1759   In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our Senate
1760   The Cockle of Rebellion, Insolence, Sedition,
1761  *Which we our selues haue plowed for, sow'd, & scatter'd,
1762   By mingling them with vs, the honor'd Number,
1763   Who lack not Vertue, no, nor Power, but that
1764   Which they haue giuen to Beggers.
1765   <S {Mene}.> Well, no more.
1766   <S {Senat}.> No more words, we beseech you.
1767   <S {Corio}.> How? no more?
      <P bb2><C B>
1768   As for my Country, I haue shed my blood,
1769   Not fearing outward force: So shall my Lungs
1770   Coine words till their decay, against those Meazels
1771   Which we disdaine should Tetter vs, yet sought
1772   The very way to catch them.
1773   <S {Bru}.> You speake a'th' people, as if you were a God,
1774   To punish; Not a man, of their Infirmity.
1775   <S {Sicin}.> 'Twere well we let the people know't.
1776   <S {Mene}.> What, what? His Choller?
1777  *<S {Cor}.> Choller? Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
1778   By Ioue, 'twould be my minde.
1779   <S {Sicin}.> It is a minde that #shall remain a poison
1780   Where it is: not poyson any further.
1781   <S {Corio}.> #Shall remaine?
1782   Heare you this Triton of the {Minnoues}? Marke you
1783   His absolute #Shall?
1784   <S {Com}.> 'Twas from the Cannon.
1785  *<S {Cor}.> #Shall? O God! but most vnwise Patricians: why
1786   You graue, but wreaklesse Senators, haue you thus
1787   Giuen Hidra heere to choose an Officer,
1788   That with his peremptory #Shall, being but
1789   The horne, and noise o'th' Monsters, wants not spirit
1790   To say, hee'l turne your Current in a ditch,
1791   And make your Channell his? If he haue power,
1792   Then vale your Ignorance: If none, awake
1793   Your dangerous Lenity: If you are Learn'd,
1794   Be not as common Fooles; if you are not,
1795   Let them haue Cushions by you. You are Plebeians,
1796   If they be Senators: and they are no lesse,
1797   When both your voices blended, the great'st taste
1798   Most pallates theirs. They choose their Magistrate,
1799   And such a one as he, who puts his #Shall,
1800   His popular #Shall, against a grauer Bench
1801   Then euer frown'd in Greece. By Ioue himselfe,
1802   It makes the Consuls base; and my Soule akes
1803   To know, when two Authorities are vp,
1804   Neither Supreame; How soone Confusion
1805   May enter 'twixt the gap of Both, and take
1806   The one by th' other.
1807   <S {Com}.> Well, on to'th' Market place.
1808   <S {Corio}.> Who euer gaue that Counsell, to giue forth
1809   The Corne a'th' Store- house gratis, as 'twas vs'd
1810   Sometime in Greece.
1811   <S {Mene}.> Well, well, no more of that.
1812  *<S {Cor}.> Thogh there the people had more absolute powre
1813  *I say they norisht disobedience: fed, the ruin of the State.
1814   <S {Bru}.> Why shall the people giue
1815   One that speakes thus, their voyce?
1816   <S {Corio}.> Ile giue my Reasons,
1817  *More worthier then their Voyces. They know the Corne
1818   Was not our recompence, resting well assur'd
1819   They ne're did seruice for't; being prest to'th' Warre,
1820   Euen when the Nauell of the State was touch'd,
1821   They would not thred the Gates: This kinde of Seruice
1822   Did not deserue Corne gratis. Being i'th' Warre,
1823   #There Mutinies and Reuolts, wherein they shew'd
1824   Most Valour spoke not for them. Th' Accusation
1825   Which they haue often made against the Senate,
1826   All cause vnborne, could neuer be the Natiue
1827   Of our so franke Donation. Well, what then?
1828   How shall this Bosome- multiplied, digest
1829   The Senates Courtesie? Let deeds expresse
1830   What's like to be their words, We did request it,
1831   We are the greater pole, and in true feare
1832   They gaue vs our demands. Thus we debase
1833   The Nature of our Seats, and make the Rabble
1834   Call our Cares, Feares; which will in time
1835   Breake ope the Lockes a'th' Senate, and bring in
1836   The Crowes to pecke the Eagles.
1837   <S {Mene}.> Come enough.
1838   <S {Bru}.> Enough, with ouer measure.
1839   <S {Corio}.> No, take more.
1840   What may be sworne by, both Diuine and Humane,
1841   Seale what I end withall. This double worship,
1842   Whereon part do's disdaine with cause, the other
1843  *Insult without all reason: where Gentry, Title, wisedom
1844   Cannot conclude, but by the yea and no
1845   Of generall Ignorance, it must omit
1846   Reall Necessities, and giue way the while
1847   To vnstable Slightnesse. Purpose so barr'd, it followes,
1848   Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore beseech you,
1849   You that will be lesse fearefull, then discreet,
1850   That loue the Fundamentall part of State
1851   More then you doubt the change on't: That preferre
1852   A Noble life, before a Long, and Wish,
1853   To iumpe a Body with a dangerous Physicke,
1854   That's sure of death without it: at once plucke out
1855   The Multitudinous Tongue, let them not licke
1856   The sweet which is their poyson. Your dishonor
1857   Mangles true iudgement, and bereaues the State
1858   Of that Integrity which should becom't:
1859   Not hauing the power to do the good it would
1860   For th' ill which doth controul't.
1861   <S {Bru}.> #Has said enough.
1862   <S {Sicin}.> #Ha's spoken like a Traitor, and shall answer
1863   As Traitors do.
1864   <S {Corio}.> Thou wretch, despight ore- whelme thee:
1865   What should the people do with these bald Tribunes?
1866   On whom depending, their obedience failes
1867   To'th' greater Bench, in a Rebellion:
1868   When what's not meet, but what must be, was Law,
1869   Then were they chosen: in a better houre,
1870   Let what is meet, be saide it must be meet,
1871   And throw their power i'th' dust.
1872   <S {Bru}.> Manifest Treason.
1873   <S {Sicin}.> This a Consull? No.
1874   <D {Enter an Aedile}.>
1875   <S {Bru}.> The Ediles hoe: Let him be apprehended:
1876   <S {Sicin}.> Go call the people, in whose name my Selfe
1877   Attach thee as a Traitorous Innouator:
1878   A Foe to'th' publike Weale. Obey I charge thee,
1879   And follow to thine answer.
1880   <S {Corio}.> Hence old Goat.
1881   <S {All}.> Wee'l Surety him.
1882   <S {Com}.> Ag'd sir, hands off.
1883   <S {Corio}.> Hence rotten thing, or I shall shake thy bones
1884   Out of thy Garments.
1885   <S {Sicin}.> Helpe ye Citizens.
1886   <D {Enter a rabble of Plebeians with the Aediles}.>
1887   <S {Mene}.> On both sides more respect.
1888  *<S {Sicin}.> Heere's hee, that would take from you all your
1889   power.
1890   <S {Bru}.> Seize him {Aediles}.
1891   <S {All}.> Downe with him, downe with him.
1892   <S 2 {Sen}.> Weapons, weapons, weapons:
1893   <D {They all bustle about Coriolanus}.>
1894   Tribunes, Patricians, Citizens: what ho:
1895   {Sicinius}, {Brutus}, {Coriolanus}, Citizens.
1896   <S {All}.> Peace, peace, peace, stay, hold, peace.
1897   <S {Mene}.> What is about to be? I am out of Breath,
1898   Confusions neere, I cannot speake. You, Tribunes
1899  *To'th' people: {Coriolanus}, patience: Speak good {Sicinius}.
      <P bb2v><C A>
1900   <S {Scici}.> Heare me, People peace.
1901  *<S {All}.> Let's #here our Tribune: peace, speake, speake,
1902   speake.
1903   <S {Scici}.> You are at point to lose your Liberties:
1904   {#Martius} would haue all from you; {Martius},
1905   Whom late you haue nam'd for Consull.
1906  *<S {Mene}.> Fie, fie, fie, this is the way to kindle, not to
1907   quench.
1908   <S {Sena}.> To vnbuild the Citie, and to lay all flat.
1909   <S {Scici}.> What is the Citie, but the People?
1910   <S {All}.> True, the People are the Citie.
1911  *<S {Brut}.> By the consent of all, we were establish'd the
1912   Peoples Magistrates.
1913   <S {All}.> You so remaine.
1914   <S {Mene}.> And so are like to doe.
1915   <S {Com}.> That is the way to lay the Citie flat,
1916   To bring the Roofe to the Foundation,
1917   And burie all, which yet distinctly raunges
1918   In heapes, and piles of Ruine.
1919   <S {Scici}.> This deserues Death.
1920   <S {Brut}.> Or let vs stand to our Authoritie,
1921   Or let vs lose it: we doe here pronounce,
1922   Vpon the part o'th' People, in whose power
1923   We were elected theirs, {Martius} is worthy
1924   Of present Death.
1925   <S {Scici}.> Therefore  lay hold of him:
1926   Beare him toth' Rock Tarpeian, and from thence
1927   Into destruction cast him.
1928   <S {Brut}.> Aediles seize him.
1929   <S {All} {Ple}.> Yeeld {Martius}, yeeld.
1930  *<S {Mene}.> Heare me one word,  'beseech you Tribunes,
1931   heare me but a word.
1932   <S {Aediles}.> Peace, peace.
1933  *<S {Mene}.> Be that you seeme, truly your Countries friend,
1934   And temp'rately proceed to what you would
1935   Thus violently redresse.
1936   <S {Brut}.> Sir, those cold wayes,
1937   That seeme like prudent helpes, are very poysonous,
1938   Where the Disease is violent. Lay hands vpon him,
1939   And beare him to the Rock.  <D {Corio. drawes his Sword}.>
1940   <S {Corio}.> No, Ile die here:
1941   There's some among you haue beheld me fighting,
1942   Come trie vpon your selues, what you haue seene me.
1943  *<S {Mene}.> Downe with that Sword, Tribunes withdraw
1944   #a while.
1945   <S {Brut}.> Lay hands vpon him.
1946  *<S {Mene}.> Helpe {Martius}, helpe: you that be noble, helpe
1947   him young and old.
1948   <S {All}.> Downe with him, downe with him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1949   <D {In this Mutinie, the Tribunes, the Aediles, and the}
1950   {People are beat in}.>
1951   <S {Mene}.> Goe, get you to our House: be gone, away.
1952   All will be naught else.
1953   <S 2.{Sena}.> Get you gone.
1954   <S {Com}.> Stand fast, we haue as many friends as enemies.
1955   <S {Mene}.> Shall it be put to that?
1956   <S {Sena}.> The Gods forbid:
1957   I prythee noble friend, home to thy House,
1958   Leaue vs to cure this Cause.
1959   <S {Mene}.> For 'tis a Sore vpon vs,
1960   You cannot Tent your selfe: be gone, 'beseech  you.
1961   <S {Corio}.> Come Sir, along with vs.
1962   <S {Mene}.> I would they were Barbarians, as they are,
1963   Though in Rome litter'd: not Romans, as they are not,
1964   Though calued i'th' Porch o'th' Capitoll:
1965   Be gone, put not your worthy Rage into your Tongue,
1966   One time will owe another.
1967   <S {Corio}.> On faire ground, I could beat fortie of them.
1968  *<S {Mene}.> I could my selfe take vp a Brace o'th' best of
1969   them, yea, the two Tribunes.
1970   <S {Com}.> But now 'tis oddes beyond Arithmetick,
1971   And Manhood is call'd Foolerie, when it stands
1972   Against a falling Fabrick. Will you hence,
1973   Before the Tagge returne? whose Rage doth rend
1974   Like interrupted Waters, and o're- beare
1975   What they are vs'd to beare.
1976   <S {Mene}.> Pray you be gone:
1977   Ile trie whether my old Wit be in request
1978   With those that haue but little: this must be patcht
1979   With Cloth of any Colour.
1980   <S {Com}.> Nay, come away.  <D {Exeunt Coriolanus and}
1981   {Cominius}.>
1982   <S {Patri}.> This man ha's marr'd his fortune.
1983   <S {Mene}.> His nature is too noble for the World:
1984   He would not flatter {Neptune} for his Trident,
1985   Or {Ioue}, for's power to Thunder: his Heart's his Mouth:
1986   What his Brest forges, that his Tongue must vent,
1987   And being angry, does forget that euer
1988   He heard the Name of Death.  <D {A Noise within}.>
1989   Here's goodly worke.
1990   <S {Patri}.> I would they were #a bed.
1991   <S {Mene}.> I would they were in Tyber.
1992   What the vengeance, could he not speake 'em faire?
      <C B>
1993   <D {Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble againe}.>
1994   <S {Sicin}.> Where is this Viper,
1995  *That would depopulate the city, & be euery man himself
1996   <S {Mene}.> You worthy Tribunes.
1997  *<S {Sicin}.> He shall be throwne downe the Tarpeian rock
1998   With rigorous hands: he hath resisted Law,
1999   And therefore Law shall scorne him further Triall
2000   Then the seuerity of the publike Power,
2001   Which he so sets at naught.
2002   <S 1 {Cit}.> He shall well know the Noble Tribunes are
2003   The peoples mouths, and we their hands.
2004   <S {All}.> He shall sure ont.
2005   <S {Mene}.> Sir, sir. <S {Sicin}.> Peace.
2006  *<S {Me}.> Do not cry hauocke, where you shold but hunt
2007   With modest warrant.
2008   <S {Sicin}.> Sir, how com'st that you haue holpe
2009   To make this rescue?
2010   <S {Mene}.> Heere me speake? As I do know
2011   The Consuls worthinesse, so can I name his Faults.
2012   <S {Sicin}.> Consull? what Consull?
2013   <S {Mene}.> The Consull {Coriolanus}.
2014   <S {Bru}.> He Consull.
2015   <S {All}.> No, no, no, no, no.
2016   <S {Mene}.> If by the Tribunes leaue,
2017   And yours good people,
2018   I may be heard, I would craue a word or two,
2019   The which shall turne you to no further harme,
2020   Then so much losse of time.
2021   <S {Sic}.> Speake breefely then,
2022   For we are peremptory to dispatch
2023   This Viporous Traitor: to eiect him hence
2024   Were but one danger, and to keepe him heere
2025   Our certaine death: therefore it is decreed,
2026   He dyes to night.
2027   <S {Menen}.> Now the good Gods forbid,
2028   That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
2029   Towards her deserued Children, is enroll'd
2030   In Ioues owne Booke, like an vnnaturall Dam
2031   Should now eate vp her owne.
      <P bb3>
2032   <S {Sicin}.> He's a Disease that must be cut away.
2033   <S {Mene}.> Oh he's a Limbe, that ha's but a Disease
2034   Mortall, to cut it off: to cure it, easie.
2035   What ha's he done to Rome, that's worthy death?
2036   Killing our Enemies, the blood he hath lost
2037   (Which I dare vouch, is more then that he hath
2038   By many an Ounce) he dropp'd it for his Country:
2039   And what is left, to loose it by his Countrey,
2040   Were to vs all that doo't, and suffer it
2041   A brand to th' end a'th World.
2042   <S {Sicin}.> This is cleane kamme.
2043   <S {Brut}.> Meerely awry:
2044   When he did loue his Country, it honour'd him.
2045   <S {Menen}.> The seruice of the foote
2046   Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
2047   For what before it was.
2048   <S {Bru}.> Wee'l heare no more:
2049   Pursue him to his house, and plucke him thence,
2050   Least his infection being of catching nature,
2051   Spred further.
2052   <S {Menen}.> One word more, one word:
2053   This Tiger- footed- rage, when it shall find
2054   The harme of vnskan'd  swiftnesse, will (too late)
2055   Tye Leaden pounds too's heeles. Proceed by Processe,
2056   Least parties (as he is belou'd) breake out,
2057   And sacke great Rome with Romanes.
2058   <S {Brut}.> If it were so?
2059   <S {Sicin}.> What do ye talke?
2060   Haue we not had a taste of his Obedience?
2061   Our Ediles smot: our selues resisted: come.
2062   <S {Mene}.> Consider this: He ha's bin bred i'th' Warres
2063   Since #a could draw a Sword, and is ill- school'd
2064   In boulted Language: Meale and Bran together
2065   He throwes without distinction. Giue me leaue,
2066   Ile go to him, and vndertake to bring him in peace,
2067   Where he shall answer by a lawfull Forme
2068   (In peace) to his vtmost perill.
2069   <S 1.{Sen}.> Noble Tribunes,
2070   It is the humane way: the other course
2071   Will proue #to bloody: and the end of it,
2072   Vnknowne to the Beginning.
2073  *<S {Sic}.> Noble {Menenius}, be you then as the peoples officer:
2074   Masters, lay downe your Weapons.
2075   <S {Bru}.> Go not home.
2076  *<S {Sic}.> Meet on the Market place: wee'l attend you there:
2077   Where if you bring not {Martius}, wee'l proceede
2078   In our first way.
2079   <S {Menen}.> Ile bring him to you.
2080   Let me desire your company: he must come,
2081   Or what is worst will follow.
2082   <S {Sena}.> Pray you let's to him.  <D {Exeunt Omnes}.>
2083   <D {Enter Coriolanus with Nobles}.>
2084   <S {Corio}.> Let them pull all about mine eares, present me
2085   Death on the Wheele, or at wilde Horses heeles,
2086   Or pile ten hilles on the Tarpeian Rocke,
2087   That the precipitation might downe stretch
2088   Below the beame of sight; yet will I still
2089   Be thus to them.
2090   <D {Enter Volumnia}.>
2091   <S {Noble}.> You do the Nobler.
2092   <S {Corio}.> I muse my Mother
2093   Do's not approue me further, who was wont
2094   To call them Wollen Vassailes, things created
2095   To buy and sell with Groats, to shew bare heads
2096   In Congregations, to yawne, be still, and wonder,
2097   When one but of my ordinance stood vp
2098   To speake of Peace, or Warre. I talke of you,
2099   Why did you wish me milder? Would you haue me
2100   False to my Nature? Rather say, I play
2101   The man I am.
2102   <S {Volum}.> Oh sir, sir, sir,
2103   I would haue had you put your power well on
2104   Before you had worne it out.
2105   <S {Corio}.> Let go.
2106  *<S {Vol}.> You might haue beene enough the man you are,
2107   With striuing lesse to be so: Lesser had bin
2108   The things of your dispositions, if
2109   You had not shew'd them how ye were dispos'd
2110   Ere they lack'd power to crosse you.
2111   <S {Corio}.> Let them hang.
2112   <S {Volum}.> #I, and burne too.
2113   <D {Enter Menenius with the Senators}.>
2114  *<S {Men}.> Come, come, you haue bin too rough, somthing
2115   too rough: you must returne, and mend it.
2116   <S {Sen}.> There's no remedy,
2117   Vnlesse by not so doing, our good Citie
2118   Cleaue in the midd'st, and perish.
2119   <S {Volum}.> Pray be counsail'd;
2120   I haue a heart as little apt as yours,
2121   But yet a braine, that leades my vse of Anger
2122   To better vantage.
2123   <S {Mene}.> Well said, Noble woman:
2124   Before he should thus stoope to'th' heart, but that
2125   The violent fit a'th' time craues it as Physicke
2126   For the whole State; I would put mine Armour on,
2127   Which I can scarsely beare.
2128   <S {Corio}.> What must I do?
2129   <S {Mene}.> Returne to th' Tribunes.
2130   <S {Corio}.> Well, what then? what then?
2131   <S {Mene}.> Repent, what you haue spoke.
2132   <S {Corio}.> For them, I cannot do it to the Gods,
2133   Must I then doo't to them?
2134   <S {Volum}.> You are too absolute,
2135   Though therein you can neuer be too Noble,
2136   But when extremities speake. I haue heard you say,
2137   Honor and Policy, like vnseuer'd Friends,
2138   I'th' Warre do grow together: Grant that, and tell me
2139   In Peace, what each of them by th' other loose,
2140   That they combine not there?
2141   <S {Corio}.> Tush, tush.
2142   <S {Mene}.> A good demand.
2143   <S {Volum}.> If it be Honor in your Warres, to seeme
2144   The same you are not, which for your best ends
2145   You adopt your policy: How is it lesse or worse
2146   That it shall hold Companionship in Peace
2147   With Honour, as in Warre; since that to both
2148   It stands in like request.
2149   <S {Corio}.> Why force you this?
2150   <S {Volum}.> Because, that
2151   Now it lyes you on to speake to th' people:
2152   Not by your owne instruction, nor by'th' matter
2153   Which your heart prompts you, but with such words
2154   That are but roated in your Tongue;
2155   Though but Bastards, and Syllables
2156   Of no allowance, to your bosomes truth.
2157   Now, this no more dishonors you at all,
2158   Then to take in a Towne with gentle words,
2159   Which else would put you to your fortune, and
2160   The hazard of much blood.
2161   I would dissemble with my Nature, where
2162   My Fortunes and my Friends at stake, requir'd
2163   I should do so in Honor. I am in this
      <P bb3v><C A>
2164   Your Wife, your Sonne: These Senators, the Nobles,
2165   And you, will rather shew our generall Lowts,
2166   How you can frowne, then spend a fawne vpon 'em,
2167   For the inheritance of their loues, and safegard
2168   Of what that want might ruine.
2169   <S {Menen}.> Noble Lady,
2170   Come goe with vs, speake faire: you may salue so,
2171   Not what is dangerous present, but the losse
2172   Of what is past.
2173   <S {Volum}.> I prythee  now, my Sonne,
2174   Goe to them, with this Bonnet in thy hand,
2175   And thus farre hauing stretcht it (here be with them)
2176   Thy Knee bussing the stones: for in such businesse
2177   Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
2178   More learned then the eares, wauing thy head,
2179   Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,
2180   Now humble as the ripest Mulberry,
2181   That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
2182   Thou art their Souldier, and being bred in broyles,
2183   Hast not the soft way, which thou do'st confesse
2184   Were fit for thee to vse, as they to clayme,
2185   In asking their good loues, but thou wilt frame
2186   Thy selfe (forsooth) hereafter theirs so farre,
2187   As thou hast power and person.
2188   <S {Menen}.> This but done,
2189   Euen as she speakes, why their hearts were yours:
2190   For they haue Pardons, being ask'd, as free,
2191   As words to little purpose.
2192   <S {Volum}.> Prythee now,
2193   Goe, and be rul'd: although I know thou hadst rather
2194   Follow thine Enemie in a fierie Gulfe,
2195   Then flatter him in a Bower.  <D {Enter Cominius}.>
2196   Here is {Cominius}.
2197   <S {Com}.> I haue beene i'th' Market place: and Sir 'tis fit
2198   You make strong partie, or defend your selfe
2199   By calmenesse, or by absence: all's in anger.
2200   <S {Menen}.> Onely faire speech.
2201  *<S {Com}.> I thinke 'twill serue, if he can thereto frame his
2202   spirit.
2203   <S {Volum}.> He must, and will:
2204   Prythee now say you will, and goe about it.
2205   <S {Corio}.> Must I goe shew them my vnbarb'd Sconce?
2206   Must I with my base Tongue giue to my Noble Heart
2207   A Lye, that it must beare well? I will doo't:
2208   Yet were there but this single Plot, to loose
2209   This Mould of {Martius}, they to dust should grinde it,
2210   And throw't against the Winde. Toth' Market place:
2211   You haue put me now to such a part, which neuer
2212   I shall discharge toth' Life.
2213   <S {Com}.> Come, come, wee'le prompt you.
2214   <S {Volum}.> I prythee now sweet Son, as thou hast said
2215   My praises made thee first a Souldier; so
2216   To haue my praise for this, performe a part
2217   Thou hast not done before.
2218   <S {Corio}.> Well, I must doo't:
2219   Away my disposition, and possesse me
2220   Some Harlots spirit: My throat of Warre be turn'd,
2221   Which quier'd with my Drumme into a Pipe,
2222   Small as an Eunuch, or the Virgin voyce
2223   That Babies lull a- sleepe: The smiles of Knaues
2224   Tent in my cheekes, and Schoole- boyes Teares take vp
2225   The Glasses of my sight:  A Beggars Tongue
2226   Make motion through my Lips, and my Arm'd knees
2227   Who bow'd but in my Stirrop, bend like his
2228   That hath receiu'd an Almes. I will not doo't,
2229   Least I surcease to honor mine owne truth,
      <C B>
2230   And by my Bodies action, teach my Minde
2231   A most inherent Basenesse.
2232   <S {Volum}.> At thy choice then:
2233   To begge of thee, it is my more dis- honor,
2234   Then thou of them. Come all to ruine, let
2235   Thy Mother rather feele thy Pride, then feare
2236   Thy dangerous Stoutnesse: for I mocke at death
2237   With as bigge heart as thou. Do as thou list,
2238   Thy Valiantnesse was mine, thou suck'st it from me:
2239   But owe thy Pride thy selfe.
2240   <S {Corio}.> Pray be content:
2241   Mother, I am going to the Market place:
2242   Chide me no more. Ile Mountebanke their Loues,
2243   Cogge their Hearts from them, and come home belou'd
2244   Of all the Trades in Rome. Looke, I am going:
2245   Commend me to my Wife, Ile returne Consull,
2246   Or neuer trust to what my Tongue can do
2247   I'th way of Flattery further.
2248   <S {Volum}.> Do your #will.  <D {Exit Volumnia}>
2249  *<S {Com}.> Away, the Tribunes do attend you: arm your self
2250   To answer mildely: for they are prepar'd
2251   With Accusations, as I heare more strong
2252   Then are vpon you yet.
2253   <S {Corio}.> The word is, Mildely. Pray you let vs go,
2254   Let them accuse me by inuention: I
2255   Will answer in mine Honor.
2256   <S {Menen}.> #I, but mildely.
2257   <S {Corio}.> Well mildely be it then, Mildely.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2258   <D {Enter Sicinius and Brutus}.>
2259   <S {Bru}.> In this point charge him home, that he affects
2260   Tyrannicall power: If he euade vs there,
2261   Inforce him with his enuy to the people,
2262   And that the Spoile got on the {Antiats}
2263   Was ne're distributed. What, will he come?
2264   <D {Enter an Edile}.>
2265   <S {Edile}.> Hee's comming.
2266   <S {Bru}.> How accompanied?
2267   <S {Edile}.> With old {Menenius}, and those Senators
2268   That alwayes fauour'd him.
2269   <S {Sicin}.> Haue you a Catalogue
2270  *Of all the Voices that we haue procur'd, set downe by'th |(Pole?
2271   <S {Edile}.> I haue: 'tis ready.
2272   <S {Sicin}.> Haue you collected them by Tribes?
2273   <S {Edile}.> I haue.
2274   <S {Sicin}.> Assemble presently the people hither:
2275   And when they heare me say, it shall be so,
2276   I'th' right and strength a'th' Commons: be it either
2277   For death, for fine, or Banishment, then let them
2278   If I say Fine, cry Fine; if Death, cry Death,
2279   Insisting on the olde prerogatiue
2280   And power i'th Truth a'th Cause.
2281   <S {Edile}.> I shall informe them.
2282   <S {Bru}.> And when such time they haue begun to cry,
2283   Let them not cease, but with a dinne confus'd
2284   Inforce the present Execution
2285   Of what we chance to Sentence.
2286   <S {Edi}.> Very well.
2287   <S {Sicin}.> Make them be strong, and ready for this hint
2288   When we shall hap to giu't them.
2289   <S {Bru}.> Go about it,
2290   Put him to Choller straite, he hath bene vs'd
2291   Euer to conquer, and to haue his worth
2292   Of contradiction. Being once chaft, he cannot
2293   Be rein'd againe to Temperance, then he speakes
      <P bb4>
2294   What's in his heart, and that is there which lookes
2295   With vs to breake his necke.
2296   <D {Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, and Comi-nius,
2297   with others}.>
2298   <S {Sicin}.> Well, heere he comes.
2299   <S {Mene}.> Calmely, I do beseech you.
2300   <S {Corio}.> I, as an Hostler, that fourth poorest peece
2301   Will beare the Knaue by'th Volume:
2302   Th' honor'd Goddes
2303   Keepe Rome in safety, and the Chaires of Iustice
2304   Supplied with worthy men, plant loue amongs
2305   Through our large Temples with y shewes of peace
2306   And not our streets with Warre.
2307   <S 1 {Sen}.> Amen, Amen.
2308   <S {Mene}.> A Noble wish.
2309   <D {Enter the Edile with the Plebeians}.>
2310   <S {Sicin}.> Draw neere ye people.
2311   <S {Edile}.> List to your Tribunes. Audience:
2312   Peace I say.
2313   <S {Corio}.> First heare me speake.
2314   <S {Both} {Tri}.> Well, say: Peace hoe.
2315  *<S {Corio}.> Shall I be charg'd no further then this present?
2316   Must all determine heere?
2317   <S {Sicin}.> I do demand,
2318   If you submit you to the peoples voices,
2319   Allow their Officers, and are content
2320   To suffer lawfull Censure for such faults
2321   As shall be prou'd vpon you.
2322   <S {Corio}.> I am Content.
2323   <S {Mene}.> Lo Citizens, he sayes he is Content.
2324   The warlike Seruice he ha's done, consider: Thinke
2325   Vpon the wounds his body beares, which shew
2326   Like Graues i'th holy Church- yard.
2327   <S {Corio}.> Scratches with Briars, scarres to moue
2328   Laughter onely.
2329   <S {Mene}.> Consider further:
2330   That when he speakes not like a Citizen,
2331   You finde him like a Soldier: do not take
2332   His rougher Actions for malicious sounds:
2333   But as I say, such as become a Soldier,
2334   Rather then enuy you.
2335   <S {Com}.> Well, well, no more.
2336   <S {Corio}.> What is the matter,
2337   That being past for Consull with full voyce:
2338   I am so dishonour'd, that the very houre
2339   You take it off againe.
2340   <S {Sicin}.> Answer to vs.
2341   <S {Corio}.> Say then: 'tis true, I ought so
2342  *<S {Sicin}.> We charge you, that you haue contriu'd to take
2343   From Rome all season'd Office, and to winde
2344   Your selfe into a power tyrannicall,
2345   For which you are a Traitor to the people.
2346   <S {Corio}.> How? Traytor?
2347   <S {Mene}.> Nay temperately: your promise.
2348  *<S {Corio}.> The fires i'th' lowest  #hell. Fould in the people:
2349   Call me their Traitor, thou iniurious Tribune.
2350   Within thine eyes sate twenty thousand deaths
2351   In thy hands clutcht: as many Millions in
2352   Thy lying tongue, both numbers. I would say
2353   Thou lyest vnto thee, with a voice as free,
2354   As I do pray the Gods.
2355   <S {Sicin}.> Marke you this people?
2356   <S {All}.> To'th' Rocke, to'th' Rocke with him.
2357   <S {Sicin}.> Peace:
2358   We neede not put new matter to his charge:
2359   What you haue seene him do, and heard him speake:
2360   Beating your Officers, cursing your selues,
2361   Opposing Lawes with stroakes, and heere defying
2362   Those whose great power must try him.
2363   Euen this so criminall, and in such capitall kinde
2364   Deserues th' extreamest death.
2365   <S {Bru}.> But since he hath seru'd well for Rome.
2366   <S {Corio}.> What do you prate of Seruice.
2367   <S {Brut}.> I talke of that, that know it.
2368   <S {Corio}.> You?
2369  *<S {Mene}.> Is this the promise that you made your mother.
2370   <S {Com}.> Know, I pray you.
2371   <S {Corio}.> Ile know no further:
2372   Let them pronounce the steepe Tarpeian death,
2373   Vagabond exile, Fleaing, pent to linger
2374   But with a graine a day, I would not buy
2375   Their mercie, at the price of one faire word,
2376   Nor checke my Courage for what they can giue,
2377   To haue't with saying, Good morrow.
2378   <S {Sicin}.> For that he ha's
2379   (As much as in him lies) from time to time
2380   Enui'd against the people; seeking meanes
2381   To plucke away their power: as now at last,
2382   Giuen Hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
2383   Of dreaded Iustice, but on the Ministers
2384   That doth distribute it. In the name a'th' people,
2385   And in the power of vs the Tribunes, wee
2386   (Eu'n from this instant) banish him our Citie
2387   In perill of precipitation
2388   From off the Rocke Tarpeian, neuer more
2389   To enter our Rome gates. I'th' Peoples name,
2390   I say it shall bee so.
2391   <S {All}.> It shall be so, it shall be so: let him away:
2392   Hee's banish'd, and it shall be so.
2393  *<S {Com}.> Heare me my Masters, and my common friends.
2394   <S {Sicin}.> He's sentenc'd: No more hearing.
2395   <S {Com}.> Let me speake:
2396   I haue bene Consull, and can shew from Rome
2397   Her Enemies markes vpon me. I do loue
2398   My Countries good, with a respect more tender,
2399   More holy, and profound, then mine owne life,
2400   My deere Wiues estimate, her wombes encrease,
2401   And treasure of my Loynes: then if I would
2402   Speake that.
2403   <S {Sicin}.> We know your drift. Speake what?
2404   <S {Bru}.> There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd
2405   As Enemy to the people, and his Countrey.
2406   It shall bee so.
2407   <S {All}.> It shall be so, it shall be so.
2408  *<S {Corio}.> You common cry of Curs, whose breath I hate,
2409   As reeke a'th' rotten Fennes: whose Loues I prize,
2410   As the dead Carkasses of vnburied men,
2411   That do corrupt my Ayre: I banish you,
2412   And heere remaine with your vncertaintie.
2413   Let euery feeble Rumor shake your hearts:
2414   Your Enemies, with nodding of their Plumes
2415   Fan you into dispaire: Haue the power still
2416   To banish your Defenders, till at length
2417   Your ignorance (which findes not till it feeles,
2418   Making but reseruation of your selues,
2419   Still your owne Foes) deliuer you
2420   As most abated Captiues, to some Nation
2421   That wonne you without blowes, despising
2422   For you the City. Thus I turne my backe;
2423   There is a world elsewhere.
2424   <D {Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, with Cumalijs}.
2425   {They all shout, and throw vp their Caps}.>
      <P bb4v>
2426   <S {Edile}.> The peoples Enemy is gone, is gone.
2427   <S {All}.> Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone: Hoo, oo.
2428   <S {Sicin}.> Go see him out at Gates, and follow him
2429   As he hath follow'd you, with all despight
2430   Giue him deseru'd vexation. Let a guard
2431   Attend vs through the City.
2432   <S {All}.> Come, come, lets see him out at gates, come:
2433   The Gods preserue our Noble Tribunes, come. <D {Exeunt}.>
2434   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
2435  *<D {Enter Coriolanus, Volumnia, Virgilia, Menenius, Cominius},
2436   {with the yong Nobility of Rome}.>
2437  *<S {Corio}.> Come leaue your teares: a brief farwel: the beast
2438   With many heads butts me away. Nay Mother,
2439   Where is your ancient Courage? You were vs'd
2440   To say, Extreamities was the trier of spirits,
2441   That common chances. Common men could beare,
2442   That when the Sea was calme, all Boats alike
2443   Shew'd Mastership in floating. Fortunes blowes,
2444  *When most strooke home, being gentle wounded, craues
2445   A Noble cunning. You were vs'd to load me
2446   With Precepts that would make inuincible
2447   The heart that conn'd them.
2448   <S {Virg}.> Oh heauens! O heauens!
2449   <S {Corio}.> Nay, I prythee woman.
2450  *<S {Vol}.> Now the Red Pestilence strike al Trades in Rome,
2451   And Occupations perish.
2452   <S {Corio}.> What, what, what:
2453   I shall be lou'd when I am lack'd. Nay Mother,
2454   Resume that Spirit, when you were wont to say,
2455   If you had beene the Wife of {Hercules},
2456   Six of his Labours youl'd haue done, and sau'd
2457   Your Husband so much swet. {Cominius},
2458   Droope not, Adieu: Farewell my Wife, my Mother,
2459   Ile do well yet. Thou old and true {Menenius},
2460   Thy teares are salter then a yonger mans,
2461  *And venomous to thine eyes. My (sometime) Generall,
2462   I haue seene #the Sterne, and thou hast oft beheld
2463   Heart- hardning spectacles. Tell these sad women,
2464   Tis fond to waile ineuitable strokes,
2465   As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My Mother, you wot well
2466   My hazards still haue beene your solace, and
2467   Beleeu't not lightly, though I go alone
2468   Like to a lonely Dragon, that his Fenne
2469   Makes fear'd, and talk'd of more then seene: your Sonne
2470   Will or exceed the Common, or be caught
2471   With cautelous baits and practice.
2472   <S {Volum}.> My first sonne,
2473   Whether will thou go? Take good {Cominius}
2474   With thee awhile: Determine on some course
2475   More then a wilde exposture, to each chance
2476   That starts i'th' way before thee.
2477   <S {Corio}.> O the Gods!
2478   <S {Com}.> Ile follow thee a Moneth, deuise with thee
2479   Where thou shalt rest, that thou may'st heare of vs,
2480   And we of thee. So if the time thrust forth
2481   A cause for thy Repeale, we shall not send
2482   O're the vast world, to seeke a single man,
2483   And loose aduantage, which doth euer coole
2484   Ith' absence of the needer.
2485   <S {Corio}.> Fare ye well:
2486   Thou hast yeares vpon thee, and thou art too full
2487   Of the warres surfets, to go roue with one
2488   That's yet vnbruis'd: bring me but out at gate.
2489   Come my sweet wife, my deerest Mother, and
2490   My Friends of Noble touch: when I am forth,
2491   Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you come:
2492   While I remaine aboue the ground, you shall
2493   Heare from me still, and neuer of me ought
2494   But what is like me formerly.
2495   <S {Menen}.> That's worthily
2496   As any eare can heare. Come, let's not weepe,
2497   If I could shake off but one seuen yeeres
2498   From these old armes and legges, by the good Gods
2499   I'ld with thee, euery foot.
2500   <S {Corio}.> Giue me thy hand, come. <D {Exeunt}>
2501   <D {Enter the two Tribunes, Sicinius, and Brutus},
2502   {with the Edile}.>
2503  *<S {Sicin}.> Bid them all home, he's gone: & wee'l no further,
2504   The Nobility are vexed, whom we see haue sided
2505   In his behalfe.
2506   <S {Brut}.> Now we haue shewne our power,
2507   Let vs seeme humbler after it is done,
2508   Then when it was #a dooing.
2509  *<S {Sicin}.> Bid them home: say their great enemy is gone,
2510   And they, stand in their ancient strength.
2511  *<S {Brut}.> Dismisse them home. Here comes his Mother.
2512   <D {Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius}.>
2513   <S {Sicin}.> Let's not meet her.
2514   <S {Brut}.> Why?
2515   <S {Sicin}.>  They say she's mad.
2516  *<S {Brut}.> They haue tane note of vs: keepe on your way.
2517   <S {Volum}.> Oh y'are well met:
2518   Th' hoorded plague a'th' Gods requit your loue.
2519   <S {Menen}.> Peace, peace, be not so loud.
2520  *<S {Volum}.> If that I could for weeping, you should heare,
2521   Nay, and you shall heare some. Will you be gone?
2522   <S {Virg}.> You shall stay too: I would I had the power
2523   To say so to my Husband.
2524   <S {Sicin}.> Are you mankinde?
2525  *<S {Volum}.> #I foole, is that a shame. Note but this Foole,
2526   Was not a man my Father? Had'st thou Foxship
2527   To banish him that strooke more blowes for Rome
2528   Then thou hast spoken words.
2529   <S {Sicin}.> Oh blessed Heauens!
2530  *<S {Volum}.> Moe Noble blowes, then euer y wise words.
2531   And for Romes good, Ile tell thee what: yet goe:
2532   Nay but thou shalt stay too: I would my Sonne
2533   Were in Arabia, and thy Tribe before him,
2534   His good Sword in his hand.
2535   <S {Sicin}.> What then?
2536  *<S {Virg}.> When then? Hee'ld make an end of thy posterity
2537   <S {Volum}.> Bastards, and all.
2538   Good man, the Wounds that he does beare for Rome!
2539   <S {Menen}.> Come, come, peace.
2540   <S {Sicin}.> I would he had continued to his Country
2541   As he began, and not vnknit himselfe
2542   The Noble knot he made.
2543   <S {Bru}.> I would he had.
2544  *<S {Volum}.> I would he had? Twas thou incenst the rable.
2545   Cats, that can iudge as fitly of his worth,
2546   As I can of those  Mysteries  which heauen
2547   Will not haue earth to know.
2548   <S {Brut}.> Pray let's go.
2549   <S {Volum}.> Now pray sir get you gone.
2550   You haue done a braue deede: Ere you go, heare this:
2551   As farre as doth the Capitoll exceede
2552   The meanest house in Rome; so farre my Sonne
      <P bb5>
2553   This Ladies Husband heere; this (do you see)
2554   Whom you haue banish'd, does exceed you all.
2555   <S {Bru}.> Well, well, wee'l leaue you.
2556   <S {Sicin}.> Why stay we to be baited
2557   With one that wants her Wits. <D {Exit Tribunes}.>
2558   <S {Volum}.> Take my Prayers with you.
2559   I would the Gods had nothing else to do,
2560   But to confirme my Cursses. Could I meete 'em
2561   But once a day, it would vnclogge my heart
2562   Of what lyes heauy too't.
2563   <S {Mene}.> You haue told them home,
2564   And by my troth you  haue cause: you'l Sup with me.
2565   <S {Volum}.> Angers my Meate: I suppe vpon my selfe,
2566   And so shall sterue with Feeding: come, let's go,
2567   Leaue this faint- puling, and lament as I do,
2568   In Anger, {Iuno}- like: Come, come, come. <D {Exeunt}>
2569   <S {Mene}.> Fie, fie, fie. <D {Exit}.>
2570   <D {Enter a Roman, and a Volce}.>
2571  *<S {Rom}.> I know you well sir, and you know mee: your
2572   name I thinke is {Adrian}.
2573   <S {Volce}.> It is so sir, truly I haue forgot you.
2574  *<S {Rom}.> I am a Roman, and my Seruices are as you are,
2575   against 'em. Know you me yet.
2576   <S {Volce}.> {Nicanor}: no.
2577   <S {Rom}.> The same sir.
2578  *<S {Volce}.> You had more Beard when I last saw you, but
2579  *your Fauour is well appear'd by your Tongue. What's
2580  *the Newes in Rome:  I haue a Note from the Volcean
2581  *state to finde you out there. You haue well saued mee a
2582   dayes iourney.
2583  *<S {Rom}.> There hath beene in Rome straunge Insurrecti-ons:
2584  *The people, against the Senatours, Patricians, and
2585   Nobles.
2586  *<S {Vol}.> Hath bin; is it ended then? Our State thinks not
2587  *so, they are in a most warlike preparation, & hope to com
2588   vpon them, in the heate of their diuision
2589  *<S {Rom}.> The maine blaze of it is past, but a small thing
2590  *would make it flame againe. For the Nobles receyue so
2591  *to heart, the Banishment of that worthy {Coriolanus}, that
2592  *they are in a ripe aptnesse, to take al power from the peo-ple,
2593  *and to plucke from them their Tribunes for euer.
2594  *This lyes glowing I can tell you, and is almost mature for
2595   the violent breaking out.
2596   <S {Vol}.> {Coriolanus} Banisht?
2597   <S {Rom}.> Banish'd sir.
2598  *<S {Vol}.> You will be welcome with this intelligence {Ni-canor}.
2599  _
2600  *<S {Rom}.> The day serues well for them now. I haue heard
2601  *it saide, the fittest time to corrupt a mans Wife, is when
2602  *shee's falne out with her Husband. Your Noble {Tullus}
2603  *{Auffidius} will appeare well in these Warres, his great
2604  *Opposer {Coriolanus} being now in no request of his coun-trey.
2605  _
2606  *<S {Volce}.> He cannot choose: I am most fortunate, thus
2607  *accidentally to encounter you. You haue ended my Bu-sinesse,
2608   and I will merrily accompany you home.
2609  *<S {Rom}.> I shall betweene this and Supper, tell you most
2610  *strange things from Rome: all tending to the  good of
2611   their Aduersaries. Haue you an Army ready say you?
2612  *<S {Vol}.> A most Royall one: The Centurions, and their
2613  *charges distinctly billetted already in th' entertainment,
2614   and to be on foot at an houres warning.
2615  *<S {Rom}.> I am ioyfull to heare of their readinesse, and am
2616  *the man I thinke, that shall set them in present Action. So
2617   sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your Company.
2618  *<S {Volce}.> You take my part from me sir, I haue the most
2619   cause to be glad of yours.
2620   <S {Rom}.> Well, let vs go together. <D {Exeunt}.>
2621   <D {Enter Coriolanus in meane Apparrell, dis-guisd},
2622   {and muffled}.>
2623   <S {Corio}.> A goodly City is this {Antium}.  Citty,
2624   'Tis I that made thy Widdowes: Many an heyre
2625   Of these faire Edifices fore my Warres
2626   Haue I heard groane, and drop: Then know me not,
2627   Least that thy Wiues with Spits, and Boyes with stones
2628   In puny Battell slay me. Saue you sir.
2629   <D {Enter a Citizen}.>
2630   <S {Cit}.> And you.
2631  *<S {Corio}.> Direct me, if it be your #will, where great {Auf-fidius}
2632   lies: Is he in {Antium}?
2633   <S {Cit}.> He is, and Feasts the Nobles of the State, at his
2634   house this night.
2635   <S {Corio}.> Which is his house, beseech you?
2636   <S {Cit}.> This heere before you.
2637   <S {Corio}.> Thanke you sir, farewell. <D {Exit Citizen}>
2638  *Oh World, thy slippery turnes! Friends now fast sworn,
2639   Whose double bosomes seemes to weare one heart,
2640   Whose Houres, whose Bed, whose Meale and Exercise
2641   Are still together: who Twin (as 'twere) in Loue,
2642   Vnseparable, shall within this houre,
2643   On a dissention of a Doit, breake out
2644   To bitterest Enmity: So fellest Foes,
2645  *Whose Passions, and whose Plots haue broke their sleep
2646   To take the one the other, by some chance,
2647  *Some tricke not worth an Egge, shall grow deere friends
2648   And inter- ioyne their yssues. So with me,
2649   My Birth- place haue I, and my loues vpon
2650   This Enemie Towne: Ile enter, if he slay me
2651   He does faire Iustice: if he giue me way,
2652   Ile do his Country Seruice. <D {Exit}.>
2653   <D {Musicke playes. Enter a Seruingman}.>
2654  *<S 1 {Ser}.> Wine, Wine, Wine: What seruice is heere? I
2655   thinke our Fellowes are asleepe.
2656   <D {Enter another Seruingman}.>
2657  *<S 2 {Ser}.> Where's {Cotus}: my M[aster]. cals for him: {Cotus}. <D {Exit}>
2658   <D {Enter Coriolanus}.>
2659   <S {Corio}.> A goodly House:
2660   The Feast smels well: but I appeare not like a Guest.
2661   <D {Enter the first Seruingman}.>
2662  *<S 1 {Ser}.> What would you haue Friend? whence are you?
2663   Here's no place for you: pray go to the doore? <D {Exit}>
2664  *<S {Corio}.> I haue deseru'd no better entertainment, in be-ing
2665   {Coriolanus}. <D {Enter second Seruant}.>
2666  *<S 2 {Ser}.> Whence are you sir? Ha's the Porter his eyes in
2667   his head, that he giues entrance to such Companions?
2668   Pray get you out.
2669   <S {Corio}.> Away.
2670   <S 2 {Ser}.> Away? Get you away.
2671   <S {Corio}.> Now th'art troublesome.
2672  *<S 2 {Ser}.> Are you so braue: Ile haue you talkt with anon
2673   <D {Enter} 3 {Seruingman, the} 1 {meets him}.>
2674   <S 3> What Fellowes this?
2675  *<S 1> A strange one as euer I look'd on: I cannot get him
2676   out o'th#house: Prythee call my Master to him.
2677  *<S 3> What haue you to do here fellow? Pray you auoid
2678   the house.
2679   <S {Corio}.> Let me but stand, I will not hurt your Harth.
2680   <S 3> What are you?
2681   <S {Corio}.> A Gentleman.
2682   <S 3> A maru'llous poore one.
2683   <S {Corio}.> True, so I am.
2684  *<S 3> Pray you poore Gentleman, take vp some other sta-tion:
      <P bb5v>
2685   Heere's no place for you, pray you auoid: Come.
2686  *<S {Corio}.> Follow your Function, go, and batten on colde
2687   bits. <D {Pushes him away from him}.>
2688  *<S 3>  What you will not? Prythee  tell my Maister what
2689   a strange Guest he ha's heere.
2690   <S 2>  And I shall. <D {Exit second Seruingman}.>
2691   <S 3>  Where dwel'st thou?
2692   <S {Corio}.> Vnder the Canopy.
2693   <S 3> Vnder the Canopy?
2694   <S {Corio}.> #I.
2695   <S 3> Where's that?
2696   <S {Corio}.> I'th City of Kites and crowes.
2697  *<S 3> I'th City of Kites and Crowes? What an Asse it is,
2698   then thou dwel'st with Dawes too?
2699   <S {Corio}.> No, I serue not thy Master.
2700   <S 3> How sir? Do you meddle with my Master?
2701  *<S {Corio}.> #I, tis an honester seruice, then to meddle with
2702  *thy Mistris: Thou prat'st, and prat'st, serue with thy tren-cher:
2703   Hence. <D {Beats him away}>
2704   <D {Enter Auffidius with the Seruingman}.>
2705   <S {Auf}.> Where is this Fellow?
2706  *<S 2> Here sir, I'de haue beaten him like a dogge, but for
2707   disturbing the Lords within.
2708  *<S {Auf}.> Whence com'st thou? What wouldst y? Thy name?
2709   Why speak'st not? Speake man: What's thy name?
2710  *<S {Corio}.> If {Tullus} not yet thou know'st me, and seeing
2711  *me, dost not thinke me for the man I am, necessitie  com-mands
2712   me name my selfe.
2713   <S {Auf}.> What is thy name?
2714   <S {Corio}.> A name vnmusicall to the Volcians eares,
2715   And harsh in sound to thine.
2716   <S {Auf}.> Say, what's thy name?
2717   Thou hast a Grim apparance, and thy Face
2718   Beares a Command in't: Though thy Tackles torne,
2719   Thou shew'st a Noble Vessell: What's thy name?
2720  *<S {Corio}.> Prepare thy brow to frowne: knowst y me yet?
2721   <S {Auf}.> I know thee not? Thy Name:
2722   <S {Corio}.> My name is {Caius Martius}, who hath done
2723   To thee particularly, and to all the Volces
2724   Great hurt and Mischiefe: thereto witnesse may
2725   My Surname {Coriolanus}. The painfull Seruice,
2726   The extreme Dangers, and the droppes of Blood
2727   Shed for my thanklesse Country, are requitted:
2728   But with that Surname, a good memorie
2729   And witnesse of the Malice and Displeasure
2730  *Which thou should'st beare me, only that name remains.
2731   The Cruelty and Enuy of the people,
2732   Permitted by our dastard Nobles, who
2733   Haue all forsooke me, hath deuour'd the rest:
2734   And suffer'd me by th' voyce of Slaues to be
2735   Hoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity,
2736   Hath brought me to thy Harth, not out of Hope
2737   (Mistake me not) to saue my life: for if
2738   I had fear'd death, of all the Men i'th' World
2739   I would haue voided thee. But in meere spight
2740   To be full quit of those my Banishers,
2741   Stand I before thee heere: Then if thou hast
2742   A heart of wreake in thee, that wilt reuenge
2743   Thine owne particular wrongs, and stop those maimes
2744  *Of shame seene through thy Country, speed thee straight
2745   And make my misery serue thy turne: So vse it,
2746   That my reuengefull Seruices may proue
2747   As Benefits to thee. For I will fight
2748   Against my Cankred Countrey, with the Spleene
2749   Of all the vnder Fiends. But if so be,
2750   Thou dar'st not this, and that to proue more Fortunes
2751   Th'art tyr'd, then in a word, I also am
2752   Longer to liue most wearie: and present
2753   My throat to thee, and to thy Ancient Malice:
2754   Which not to cut, would shew thee but a Foole,
2755   Since I haue euer followed thee with hate,
2756   Drawne Tunnes of Blood out of thy Countries brest,
2757   And cannot liue but to thy shame, vnlesse
2758   It be to do thee seruice.
2759   <S {Auf}.> Oh {Martius}, {Martius};
2760   Each word thou hast spoke, hath weeded from my heart
2761   A roote of Ancient Enuy. If Iupiter
2762   Should from yond clowd speake diuine things,
2763   And say 'tis true; I'de not beleeue them more
2764   Then thee all- Noble {Martius}. Let me twine
2765   Mine armes about that body, where against
2766   My grained Ash an hundred times hath broke,
2767   And scarr'd the Moone with splinters: heere I cleep
2768   The Anuile of my Sword, and do contest
2769   As hotly, and as Nobly with thy Loue,
2770   As euer in Ambitious strength, I did
2771   Contend against thy Valour. Know thou first,
2772   I lou'd the Maid I married: neuer man
2773   Sigh'd truer breath. But that I see thee heere
2774   Thou Noble thing, more dances my rapt heart,
2775   Then when I first my wedded Mistris saw
2776   Bestride my Threshold. Why, thou Mars I tell thee,
2777   We haue a Power on foote: and I had purpose
2778   Once more to hew thy Target from thy Brawne,
2779   Or loose mine Arme for't: Thou hast beate mee out
2780   Twelue seuerall times, and I haue nightly since
2781   Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thy selfe and me:
2782   We haue beene downe together in my sleepe,
2783   Vnbuckling Helmes, fisting each others Throat,
2784   And wak'd halfe dead with nothing. Worthy {Martius},
2785   Had we no other quarrell else to Rome, but that
2786   Thou art thence Banish'd, we would muster all
2787   From twelue, to seuentie: and powring Warre
2788   Into the bowels of vngratefull Rome,
2789   Like a bold Flood o're- beate. Oh come, go in,
2790   And take our friendly Senators by'th' hands
2791   Who now are heere, taking their leaues of mee,
2792   Who am prepar'd against your Territories,
2793   Though not for Rome it selfe.
2794   <S {Corio}.> You blesse me Gods.
2795   <S {Auf}.> Therefore most absolute Sir, if thou wilt haue
2796   The leading of thine owne Reuenges, take
2797   Th' one halfe of my Commission, and set downe
2798   As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
2799  *Thy Countries strength and weaknesse, thine own waies
2800   Whether to knocke against the Gates of Rome,
2801   Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
2802   To fright them, ere destroy. But come in,
2803   Let me commend thee first, to those that shall
2804   Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes,
2805   And more a Friend, then ere an Enemie,
2806   Yet {Martius} that was much. Your hand: most welcome.
2807   <D {Exeunt}>
2808   <D {Enter two of the Seruingmen}.>
2809   <S 1> Heere's a strange alteration?
2810  *<S 2> By my hand, I had thoght to haue stroken him with
2811  *a Cudgell, and yet my minde gaue me, his cloathes made
2812   a false report of him.
2813  *<S 1> What an Arme he has, he turn'd me about with his
2814   finger and his thumbe, as one would set vp a Top.
2815  *<S 2> Nay, I knew by his face that there was some- thing
2816  *in him. He had sir, a kinde of face me thought, I cannot
      <P bb6>
2817   tell how to tearme it.
2818  *<S 1> He had so, looking as it were, would I were hang'd
2819  *but I thought there was more in him, then I could think.
2820  *<S 2> So did I, Ile be sworne: He is simply the rarest man
2821   i'th' world.
2822   <S 1> I thinke he is: but a greater soldier then he,
2823   You wot one.
2824   <S 2> Who my Master?
2825   <S 1> Nay, it's no matter for that.
2826   <S 2> Worth six on him.
2827  *<S 1> Nay not so neither: but I take him to be the greater
2828   Souldiour.
2829  *<S 2> Faith  looke you, one cannot tell how to say that: for
2830   the Defence of a Towne, our Generall is excellent.
2831   <S 1> #I, and for an assault too.
2832   <D {Enter the third Seruingman}.>
2833  *<S 3> Oh Slaues, I can tell you Newes, News you Rascals
2834   <S {Both}.> What, what, what? Let's partake.
2835   <S 3> I would not be a Roman of all Nations; I had as
2836   liue be a condemn'd man.
2837   <S {Both}.> Wherefore? Wherefore?
2838  *<S 3> Why here's he that was wont to thwacke our Ge-nerall,
2839   {Caius Martius}.
2840   <S 1> Why do you say, thwacke our Generall?
2841  *<S 3> I do not say thwacke our Generall, but he was al-wayes
2842   good enough for him
2843  *<S 2> Come we are fellowes and friends: he was euer too
2844   hard for him, I haue heard him say so himselfe.
2845  *<S 1> He was too hard for him directly, to say the Troth
2846  *on't before {Corioles}, he scotcht him, and notcht him like a
2847   Carbinado.
2848  *<S 2> #And hee had bin Cannibally giuen, hee might haue
2849   boyld and eaten him too.
2850   <S 1> But more of thy Newes.
2851  *<S 3> Why he is so made on heere within, as if hee were
2852  *Son and Heire to Mars, set at vpper end o'th' Table: No
2853  *question askt him by any of the Senators, but they stand
2854  *bald before him. Our Generall himselfe makes a Mistris
2855  *of him, Sanctifies himselfe with's hand, and turnes vp the
2856  *white o'th' eye to his Discourse. But the bottome of the
2857  *Newes is, our Generall is cut i'th' middle, & but one halfe
2858  *of what he was yesterday. For the other ha's halfe, by
2859  *the intreaty and graunt of the whole Table. Hee'l go he
2860  *sayes, and sole the Porter of Rome Gates by th' eares. He
2861  *will mowe all downe before him, and leaue his passage
2862   poul'd.
2863   <S 2> And he's as like to do't, as any man I can imagine.
2864  *<S 3> Doo't? he will doo't: for look you sir, he has as ma-ny
2865  *Friends as Enemies: which Friends sir as it were, durst
2866  *not (looke you sir) shew themselues (as we terme it) his
2867   Friends, whilest he's in Directitude.
2868   <S 1> Directitude? What's that?
2869  *<S 3> But when they shall see sir, his Crest vp againe, and
2870  *the man in blood, they will out of their Burroughes (like
2871   Conies after Raine) and reuell all with him.
2872   <S 1> But when goes this forward:
2873  *<S 3> To morrow, to day, presently, you shall haue the
2874  *Drum strooke vp this afternoone: 'Tis as it were a parcel
2875  *of their Feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
2876  *<S 2> Why then wee shall haue a stirring World againe:
2877  *This peace is nothing, but to rust Iron, encrease Taylors,
2878   and breed Ballad- makers.
2879  *<S 1> Let me haue Warre say I, it exceeds peace as farre
2880  *as day do's night: It's sprightly walking, audible, and full
2881  *of Vent. Peace, is a very Apoplexy, Lethargie, mull'd,
2882  *deafe, sleepe, insensible, a getter of more bastard Chil-dren,
2883   then warres a destroyer of men.
2884  *<S 2> 'Tis so, and as warres in some sort may be saide to
2885  *be a Rauisher, so it cannot be denied, but peace is a great
2886   maker of Cuckolds.
2887   <S 1> #I, and it makes men hate one another.
2888  *<S 3> Reason, because they then lesse neede one another:
2889  *The Warres for my money. I hope to see Romanes as
2890   cheape as Volcians. They are rising, they are rising.
2891   <S {Both}.> In, in, in, in.  <D {Exeunt}>
2892   <D {Enter the two Tribunes, Sicinius, and Brutus}.>
2893  *<S {Sicin}.> We heare not of him, neither need we fear him,
2894   His remedies are tame, the present peace,
2895   And quietnesse of the people, which before
2896   Were in wilde hurry. Heere do we make his Friends
2897   Blush, that the world goes well: who rather had,
2898   Though they themselues did suffer by't, behold
2899   Dissentious numbers pestring streets, then see
2900   Our Tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
2901   About their Functions friendly.
2902   <D {Enter Menenius}.>
2903  *<S {Bru}.> We stood too't in good time. Is this {Menenius}?
2904  *<S {Sicin}.> 'Tis he, 'tis he: O he is grown most kind of late:
2905   Haile Sir.  <S {Mene}.> Haile to you both.
2906  *<S {Sicin}.> Your {Coriolanus} is not much mist, but with his
2907  *Friends: the Commonwealth  doth stand, and so would
2908   do, were he more angry at it.
2909  *<S {Mene}.> All's well, and might haue bene much better,
2910   if he could haue temporiz'd.
2911   <S {Sicin}.> Where is he, heare you?
2912   <S {Mene}.> Nay I heare nothing:
2913   His Mother and his wife, heare nothing from him.
2914   <D {Enter three or foure Citizens}.>
2915   <S {All}.> The Gods preserue you both.
2916   <S {Sicin}.> Gooden our Neighbours.
2917   <S {Bru}.> Gooden to you all, gooden to you all.
2918   <S 1> Our selues, our wiues, and children, on our knees,
2919   Are bound to pray for you both.
2920   <S {Sicin}.> Liue, and thriue.
2921   <S {Bru}.> Farewell kinde Neighbours:
2922   We wisht {Coriolanus} had lou'd you as we did.
2923   <S {All}.> Now the Gods keepe you.
2924   <S {Both} {Tri}.> Farewell, farewell.  <D {Exeunt Citizens}>
2925   <S {Sicin}.> This is a happier and more comely time,
2926   Then when these Fellowes ran about the streets,
2927   Crying Confusion.
2928   <S {Bru}.> {Caius Martius} was
2929   A worthy Officer i'th' Warre, but Insolent,
2930   O'recome with Pride, Ambitious, past all thinking
2931   Selfe- louing.
2932  *<S {Sicin}.> And affecting one sole Throne, without assista[n]ce
2933   <S {Mene}.> I thinke not so.
2934   <S {Sicin}.> We should by this, to all our Lamention,
2935   If he had gone forth Consull, found it so.
2936   <S {Bru}.> The Gods haue well preuented it, and Rome
2937   Sits safe and still, without him.
2938   <D {Enter an Aedile}.>
2939   <S {Aedile}.> Worthy Tribunes,
2940   There is a Slaue whom we haue put in prison,
2941   Reports the Volces with two seuerall Powers
2942   Are entred in the Roman Territories,
2943   And with the deepest malice of the Warre,
2944   Destroy, what lies before' em.
2945   <S {Mene}.> 'Tis {Auffidius},
2946   Who hearing of our {Martius} Banishment,
2947   Thrusts forth his hornes againe into the world
2948   Which were In- shell'd, when {Martius} stood for Rome,
      <P bb6v>
2949   And durst not once peepe out.
2950   <S {Sicin}.> Come, what talke you of {Martius}.
2951   <S {Bru}.> Go see this Rumorer whipt, it cannot be,
2952   The Volces dare breake with vs.
2953   <S {Mene}.> Cannot be?
2954   We haue Record, that very well it can,
2955   And three examples of the like, hath beene
2956   Within my Age. But reason with the fellow
2957   Before you punish him, where he heard this,
2958   Least you shall chance to whip your Information,
2959   And beate the Messenger, who bids beware
2960   Of what is to be dreaded.
2961   <S {Sicin}.> Tell not me: I know this cannot be.
2962   <S {Bru}.> Not possible.
2963   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2964   <S {Mes}.> The Nobles in great earnestnesse are going
2965   All to the Senate- house: some newes is comming
2966   That turnes their Countenances.
2967   <S {Sicin}.> 'Tis this Slaue:
2968   Go whip him fore the peoples eyes: His raising,
2969   Nothing but his report.
2970   <S {Mes}.> Yes worthy Sir,
2971   The Slaues report is seconded, and more
2972   More fearfull is deliuer'd.
2973   <S {Sicin}.> What more fearefull?
2974   <S {Mes}.> It is spoke freely out of many mouths,
2975   How probable I do not know, that {Martius}
2976   Ioyn'd with {Auffidius}, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
2977   And vowes Reuenge as spacious, as betweene
2978   The yong'st and oldest thing.
2979   <S {Sicin}.> This is most likely.
2980   <S {Bru}.> Rais'd onely, that the weaker sort may wish
2981   Good {Martius} home againe.
2982   <S {Sicin}.> The very tricke on't.
2983   <S {Mene}.> This is vnlikely,
2984   He, and {Auffidius} can no more attone
2985   Then violent'st Contrariety.
2986   <D {Enter Messenger}.>
2987   <S {Mes}.> You are sent for to the Senate:
2988   A fearefull Army, led by {Caius Martius},
2989   Associated with {Auffidius}, Rages
2990   Vpon our Territories, and haue already
2991   O're- borne their way, consum'd with fire, and tooke
2992   What lay before them.
2993   <D {Enter Cominius}.>
2994   <S {Com}.> Oh you haue made good worke.
2995   <S {Mene}.> What newes? What newes?
2996  *<S {Com}.> You haue holp to rauish your owne daughters, &
2997   To melt the Citty Leades vpon your pates,
2998   To see your Wiues dishonour'd to your Noses.
2999   <S {Mene}.> What's the newes? What's the newes?
3000   <S {Com}.> Your Temples burned in their Ciment, and
3001   Your Franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
3002   Into an Augors boare.
3003   <S {Mene}.> Pray now, your Newes:
3004  *You haue made faire worke I feare me: pray your newes,
3005   If {Martius} should be ioyn'd with Volceans.
3006   <S {Com}.> If? He is their God, he leads them like a thing
3007   Made by some other Deity then Nature,
3008   That shapes man Better: and they follow him
3009   Against vs Brats, with no lesse Confidence,
3010   Then Boyes pursuing Summer Butter- flies,
3011   Or Butchers killing Flyes.
3012   <S {Mene}.> You haue made good worke,
3013   You and your Apron men: you, that stood so much
3014   Vpon the voyce of occupation, and
3015   The breath of Garlicke- eaters.
3016   <S {Com}.> Hee'l shake your Rome about your eares.
3017  *<S {Mene}.> As {Hercules} did shake downe Mellow Fruite:
3018   You haue made faire worke.
3019   <S {Brut}.> But is this true sir?
3020   <S {Com}.> #I, and you'l looke pale
3021   Before you finde it other. All the Regions
3022   Do smilingly Reuolt, and who resists
3023   Are mock'd for valiant Ignorance,
3024   And perish constant Fooles: who is't can blame him?
3025   Your Enemies and his, finde something in him.
3026   <S {Mene}.> We are all vndone, vnlesse
3027   The Noble man haue mercy.
3028   <S {Com}.> Who shall aske it?
3029   The Tribunes cannot doo't for shame; the people
3030   Deserue such pitty of him, as the Wolfe
3031   Doe's of the Shepheards: For his best Friends, if they
3032   Should say be good to Rome, they charg'd him, euen
3033   As those should do that had deseru'd his hate,
3034   And therein shew'd like Enemies.
3035  *<S {Me}.> 'Tis true, if he were putting to my house, the brand
3036   That should consume it, I haue not the face
3037   To say, beseech you cease. You haue made faire hands,
3038   You and your Crafts, you haue crafted faire.
3039   <S {Com}.> You haue brought
3040   A Trembling vpon Rome, such as was neuer
3041   S' incapeable of helpe.
3042   <S {Tri}.> Say not, we brought it.
3043   <S {Mene}.> How? #Was't we? We lou'd him,
3044   But like Beasts, and Cowardly Nobles,
3045   Gaue way vnto your Clusters, who did hoote
3046   Him out o'th' Citty.
3047   <S {Com}.> But I feare
3048   They'l roare him in againe. {Tullus Affidius},
3049   The second name of men, obeyes his points
3050   As if he were his Officer: Desperation,
3051   Is all the Policy, Strength, and Defence
3052   That Rome can make against them.
3053   <D {Enter a Troope of Citizens}.>
3054   <S {Mene}.> Heere come the Clusters.
3055   And is {Auffidius} with him? You are they
3056   That made the Ayre vnwholsome, when you cast
3057   Your stinking, greasie Caps, in hooting
3058   At {Coriolanus} Exile. Now he's comming,
3059   And not a haire vpon a Souldiers head
3060   Which will not proue a whip: As many Coxcombes
3061   As you threw Caps vp, will he tumble downe,
3062   And pay you for your voyces. 'Tis no matter,
3063   If he could burne vs all into one coale,
3064   We haue deseru'd it.
3065   <S {Omnes}.> Faith, we heare fearfull Newes.
3066   <S 1 {Cit}.> For mine owne part,
3067   When I said banish him, I said 'twas pitty.
3068   <S 2> And so did I.
3069  *<S 3> And so did I: and to say the truth, so did very ma-ny
3070  *of vs, that we did we did for the best, and though wee
3071  *willingly consented to his Banishment, yet it was against
3072   our #will.
3073   <S {Com}.> Y'are goodly things, you Voyces.
3074   <S {Mene}.> You haue made good worke
3075   You and your cry. Shal's to the Capitoll?
3076   <S {Com}.> Oh #I, what else?  <D {Exeunt both}.>
3077   <S {Sicin}.> Go Masters get you home, be not dismaid,
3078   These are a Side, that would be glad to haue
3079   This true, which they so seeme to feare. Go home,
3080   And shew no signe of Feare.
      <P cc1>
3081  *<S 1 {Cit}.> The Gods bee good to vs: Come Masters let's
3082  *home, I euer said we were i'th wrong, when we banish'd
3083   him.
3084  *<S 2 {Cit}.> So did we all. But come, let's home.  <D {Exit Cit}.>
3085   <S {Bru}.> I do not like this Newes.
3086   <S {Sicin}.> Nor I.
3087   <S {Bru}.> Let's to the Capitoll: would halfe my wealth
3088   Would buy this for a lye.
3089   <S {Sicin}.> Pray let's go.  <D {Exeunt Tribunes}.>
3090   <D {Enter Auffidius with his Lieutenant}.>
3091   <S {Auf}.> Do they still flye to'th' Roman?
3092   <S {Lieu}.> I do not know what Witchcraft's in him: but
3093   Your Soldiers vse him as the Grace 'fore meate,
3094   Their talke at Table, and their Thankes at end,
3095   And you are darkned in this action Sir,
3096   Euen by your owne.
3097   <S {Auf}.> I cannot helpe it now,
3098   Vnlesse by vsing meanes I lame the foote
3099   Of our designe. He beares himselfe more proudlier,
3100   Euen to my person, then I thought he would
3101   When first I did embrace him. Yet his Nature
3102   In that's no Changeling, and I must excuse
3103   What cannot be amended.
3104   <S {Lieu}.> Yet I wish Sir,
3105   (I meane for your particular) you had not
3106   Ioyn'd in Commission with him: but either haue borne
3107   The action of your selfe, or else to him, had left it soly.
3108   <S {Auf}.> I vnderstand thee well, and be thou sure
3109   When he shall come to his account, he knowes not
3110   What I can vrge against him, although it seemes
3111   And so he thinkes, and is no lesse apparant
3112   To th' vulgar eye, that he beares all things fairely:
3113   And shewes good Husbandry for the Volcian State,
3114   Fights Dragon- like, and does atcheeue  as soone
3115   As draw his Sword: yet he hath left vndone
3116   That which shall breake his necke, or hazard mine,
3117   When ere we come to our account.
3118  *<S {Lieu}.> Sir, I beseech you, think you he'l carry Rome?
3119   <S {Auf}.> All places yeelds to him ere he sits downe,
3120   And the Nobility of Rome are his:
3121   The Senators and Patricians loue him too:
3122   The Tribunes are no Soldiers: and their people
3123   Will be as rash in the repeale, as hasty
3124   To expell him thence. I thinke hee'l be to Rome
3125   As is the Aspray to the Fish, who takes it
3126   By Soueraignty of Nature. First, he was
3127   A Noble seruant to them, but he could not
3128   Carry his Honors eeuen: whether 'twas Pride
3129   Which out of dayly Fortune euer taints
3130   The happy man; whether detect of iudgement,
3131   To faile in the disposing of those chances
3132   Which he was Lord of: or whether Nature,
3133   Not to be other then one thing, not moouing
3134   From th' Caske to th' Cushion: but commanding peace
3135   Euen with the same austerity and garbe,
3136   As he controll'd the warre. But one of these
3137   (As he hath spices of them all) not all,
3138   For I dare so farre free him, made him fear'd,
3139   So hated, and so banish'd: but he ha's a Merit
3140   To choake it in the vtt'rance: So our Vertue,
3141   Lie in th' interpretation of the time,
3142   And power vnto it selfe most commendable,
3143   Hath not a Tombe so euident as a Chaire
3144   T' extoll what it hath done.
3145   One fire driues out one fire; one Naile, one Naile;
3146  *Rights by rights fouler, strengths by strengths do faile.
3147   Come let's away: when {Caius} Rome is thine,
3148  *Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.  <D {Exeunt}>
3149   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
3150   <D {Enter Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius, Brutus},
3151   {the two Tribunes, with others}.>
3152   <S {Menen}.> No, ile not go: you heare what he hath said
3153   Which was sometime his Generall: who loued him
3154   In a most deere particular. He call'd me Father:
3155   But what o'that? Go you that banish'd him
3156   A Mile before his Tent, fall downe, and knee
3157   The way into his mercy: Nay, if he coy'd
3158   To heare {Cominius} speake, Ile keepe at home.
3159   <S {Com}.> He would not seeme to know me.
3160   <S {Menen}.> Do you heare?
3161   <S {Com}.> Yet one time he did call me by my name:
3162   I vrg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
3163   That we haue bled together. {Coriolanus}
3164   He would not answer #too: Forbad all Names,
3165   He was a kinde of Nothing, Titlelesse,
3166   Till he had forg'd himselfe a name a'th' fire
3167   Of burning Rome.
3168   <S {Menen}.> Why so: you haue made good worke:
3169   A paire of Tribunes, that haue wrack'd for Rome,
3170   To make Coales cheape: A Noble memory.
3171   <S {Com}.> I minded him, how Royall 'twas  to pardon
3172   When it was lesse expected. He replyed
3173   It was a bare petition of a State
3174   To one whom they had punish'd.
3175   <S {Menen}.> Very well, could he say lesse.
3176   <S {Com}.> I offered to awaken his regard
3177   For's priuate Friends. His answer to me was
3178   He could not stay to picke them, in a pile
3179   Of noysome musty Chaffe. He said, 'twas folly
3180   For one poore graine or two, to leaue vnburnt
3181   And still to nose th' offence.
3182   <S {Menen}.> For one poore graine or two?
3183   I am one of those: his Mother, Wife, his Childe,
3184   And this braue Fellow too: we are the Graines,
3185   You are the musty Chaffe, and you are smelt
3186   Aboue the Moone. We must be burnt for you.
3187   <S {Sicin}.> Nay, pray be patient: If you refuse your ayde
3188   In this so neuer- needed helpe, yet do not
3189   Vpbraid's with our distresse. But sure if you
3190   Would be your Countries Pleader, your good tongue
3191   More then the instant Armie we can make
3192   Might stop our Countryman.
3193   <S {Mene}.> No: Ile not meddle.
3194   <S {Sicin}.> Pray you go to him.
3195   <S {Mene}.> What should I do?
3196   <S {Bru}.> Onely make triall what your Loue can do,
3197   For Rome, towards {Martius}.
3198   <S {Mene}.> Well, and say that {Martius} returne mee,
3199   As {Cominius} is return'd, vnheard: what then?
3200   But as a discontented Friend, greefe- shot
3201   With his vnkindnesse. Say't be so?
3202   <S {Sicin}.> Yet your good #will
3203   Must haue that thankes from Rome, after the measure
3204   As you intended well.
3205   <S {Mene}.> Ile vndertak't:
3206   I thinke hee'l heare me. Yet to bite his lip,
3207   And humme at good {Cominius}, much vnhearts mee.
      <P cc1v>
3208   He was not taken well, he had not din'd,
3209   The Veines vnfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
3210   We powt vpon the Morning, are vnapt
3211   To giue or to forgiue; but when we haue stufft
3212   These Pipes, and these Conueyances of our blood
3213   With Wine and Feeding, we haue suppler Soules
3214   Then in our Priest- like Fasts: therefore Ile watch him
3215   Till he be dieted to my request,
3216   And then Ile set vpon him.
3217   <S {Bru}.> You know the very rode into his kindnesse,
3218   And cannot lose your way.
3219   <S {Mene}.> Good faith Ile proue him,
3220   Speed how it will. I shall ere long, haue knowledge
3221   Of my successe.  <D {Exit}.>
3222   <S {Com}.> Hee'l neuer heare him.
3223   <S {Sicin}.> Not.
3224   <S {Com}.> I tell you, he doe's sit in Gold, his eye
3225   Red as 'twould burne Rome: and his Iniury
3226   The Gaoler to his pitty. I kneel'd before him,
3227   'Twas very faintly he said Rise: dismist me
3228   Thus with his speechlesse hand. What he would do
3229   He sent in writing after me: what he would not,
3230   Bound with an Oath to yeeld to his conditions:
3231   So that all hope is vaine, vnlesse his Noble Mother,
3232   And his Wife, who (as I heare) meane to solicite him
3233   For mercy to his Countrey: therefore let's hence,
3234   And with our faire intreaties #hast them on.  <D {Exeunt}>
3235   <D {Enter Menenius to the Watch or Guard}.>
3236   <S 1.{Wat}.> Stay: whence are you.
3237   <S 2.{Wat}.> Stand, and go backe.
3238  *<S {Me}.> You guard like men, 'tis well. But by your leaue,
3239  *I am an Officer of State, & come to speak with {Coriolanus}
3240   <S 1> From whence? <S {Mene}.> From Rome.
3241  *<S I> You may not passe, you must returne: our Generall
3242   will no more heare from thence.
3243   <S 2> You'l see your Rome embrac'd with fire, before
3244   You'l speake with {Coriolanus}.
3245   <S {Mene}.> Good my Friends,
3246   If you haue heard your Generall talke of Rome,
3247   And of his Friends there, it is Lots to Blankes,
3248   My name hath touch't your eares: it is {Menenius}.
3249   <S 1> Be it so, go back: the vertue of your name,
3250   Is not heere passable.
3251   <S {Mene}.> I tell thee Fellow,
3252   Thy Generall is my Louer: I haue beene
3253   The booke of his good Acts, whence men haue read
3254   His Fame vnparalell'd, happely amplified:
3255   For I haue euer verified my Friends,
3256   (Of whom hee's cheefe) with all the size that verity
3257   Would without lapsing suffer: Nay, sometimes,
3258   Like to a Bowle vpon a subtle ground
3259   I haue tumbled past the throw: and in his praise
3260   Haue (almost) stampt the Leasing. Therefore Fellow,
3261   I must haue leaue to passe.
3262  *<S 1> Faith Sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalfe,
3263  *as you haue vttered words in your owne, you should not
3264  *passe heere: no, though it were as vertuous to lye, as to
3265   liue chastly. Therefore go backe.
3266  *<S {Men}.> Prythee fellow, remember my name is {Menenius},
3267   alwayes factionary on the party of your Generall.
3268  *<S 2> Howsoeuer you haue bin his Lier, as you say you
3269  *haue, I am one that telling true vnder him, must say you
3270   cannot passe. Therefore go backe.
3271  *<S {Mene}.> Ha's he din'd can'st thou tell? For I would not
3272   speake with him, till after dinner.
3273   <S 1> You are a Roman, are you?
3274   <S {Mene}.> I am as thy Generall is.
3275  *<S 1> Then you should hate Rome, as he do's. Can you,
3276  *when you haue pusht out your gates, the very Defender
3277  *of them, and in a violent popular ignorance, giuen your
3278  *enemy your shield, thinke to front his reuenges with the
3279  *easie groanes of old women, the Virginall Palms of your
3280  *daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a de-cay'd
3281  *Dotant as you seeme to be? Can you think to blow
3282  *out the intended fire, your City is ready to flame in, with
3283  *such weake breath as this? No, you are deceiu'd, therfore
3284  *backe to Rome, and prepare for your execution: you are
3285  *condemn'd, our Generall has sworne you out of repreeue
3286   and pardon.
3287   <S {Mene}.> Sirra, if thy Captaine knew I were heere,
3288   He would vse me with estimation.
3289   <S 1> Come, my Captaine knowes you not.
3290   <S {Mene}.> I meane thy Generall.
3291  *<S 1> My Generall cares not for you. Back I say, go: least
3292  *I let forth your halfe pinte of blood. Backe, that's the vt-most
3293   of your hauing, backe.
3294   <S {Mene}.> Nay but Fellow, Fellow.
3295   <D {Enter Coriolanus with Auffidius}.>
3296   <S {Corio}.> What's the matter?
3297  *<S {Mene}.> Now you Companion: Ile say an arrant for you:
3298  *you shall know now that I am in estimation: you shall
3299  *perceiue, that a Iacke gardant cannot office me from my
3300  *Son {Coriolanus}, guesse but my entertainment with him: if
3301  *thou stand'st not i'th state of hanging, or of some death
3302  *more long in Spectatorship, and crueller in suffering, be-hold
3303  *now presently, and swoond for what's to come vpon
3304  *thee. The glorious Gods sit in hourely Synod about thy
3305  *particular prosperity, and loue thee no worse then thy old
3306  *Father {Menenius} do's. O my Son, my Son! thou art pre-paring
3307  *fire for vs: looke thee, heere's water to quench it.
3308  *I was hardly moued to come to thee: but beeing assured
3309  *none but my selfe could moue thee, I haue bene blowne
3310  *out of your Gates with sighes: and coniure thee to par-don
3311  *Rome, and thy petitionary Countrimen. The good
3312  *Gods asswage thy wrath, and turne the dregs of it, vpon
3313  *this Varlet heere: This, who like a blocke hath denyed
3314   my accesse to thee.
3315   <S {Corio}.> Away.
3316   <S {Mene}.> How? Away?
3317  *<S {Corio}.> Wife, Mother, Child, I know not. My affaires
3318   Are Seruanted to others: Though I owe
3319   My Reuenge properly, my remission lies
3320   In Volcean brests. That we haue beene familiar,
3321   Ingrate forgetfulnesse shall poison rather
3322   Then pitty: Note how much, therefore be gone.
3323   Mine eares against your suites, are stronger then
3324   Your gates against my force. Yet for I loued thee,
3325   Take this along, I writ it for thy sake,
3326   And would haue sent it. Another word {Menenius},
3327   I will not heare thee speake. This man {Auffidius}
3328   Was my belou'd in Rome: yet thou behold'st.
3329   <S {Auffid}.> You keepe a constant temper.  <D {Exeunt}>
3330   <D {Manet the Guard and Menenius}.>
3331   <S 1> Now sir, is your name {Menenius}?
3332   <S 2> 'Tis a spell you see of much power:
3333   You know the way home againe.
3334  *<S 1> Do you heare how wee are shent for keeping your
3335   greatnesse backe?
3336   <S 2> What cause do you thinke I haue to swoond?
3337  *<S {Menen}.> I neither care for th' world, nor your General:
3338  *for such things as you. I can scarse thinke ther's any, y'are
3339  *so slight. He that hath a #will to die by himselfe, feares it
      <P cc2>
3340  *not from another: Let your Generall do his worst. For
3341  *you, bee that you are, long; and your misery encrease
3342  *with your age. I say to you, as I was said to, Away.  <D {Exit}>
3343   <S 1> A Noble Fellow I warrant him.
3344  *<S 2> The worthy Fellow is our General. He's the Rock,
3345   The Oake not to be winde- shaken.  <D {Exit Watch}.>
3346   <D {Enter Coriolanus and Auffidius}.>
3347  *<S {Corio}.> We will before the walls of Rome to morrow
3348   Set downe our Hoast. My partner in this Action,
3349   You must report to th' Volcian Lords, how plainly
3350   I haue borne this Businesse.
3351   <S {Auf}.> Onely their ends you haue respected,
3352   Stopt your eares against the generall suite of Rome:
3353  *Neuer admitted a priuat whisper, no not with such frends
3354   That thought them sure of you.
3355   <S {Corio}.> This last old man,
3356   Whom with a crack'd heart I haue sent to Rome,
3357   Lou'd me, aboue the measure of a Father,
3358   Nay godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
3359   Was to send him: for whose old Loue I haue
3360   (Though I shew'd sowrely to him) once more offer'd
3361   The first Conditions which they did refuse,
3362   And cannot now accept, to grace him  onely,
3363   That thought he could do more: A very little
3364   I haue yeelded #too. Fresh Embasses, and Suites,
3365   Nor from the State, nor priuate friends heereafter
3366  *Will I lend eare to. Ha? what shout is this?  <D {Shout within}>
3367   Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
3368   In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
3369   <D {Enter Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria, yong Martius},
3370   {with Attendants}.>
3371   My wife comes formost, then the honour'd mould
3372   Wherein this Trunke was fram'd, and in her hand
3373   The Grandchilde to her blood. But out affection,
3374   All bond and priuiledge of Nature breake;
3375   Let it be Vertuous to be Obstinate.
3376   What is that Curt'sie worth? Or those Doues eyes,
3377   Which can make Gods forsworne? I melt, and am not
3378   Of stronger earth then others: my Mother bowes,
3379   As if Olympus to a Mole- hill should
3380   In supplication Nod: and my yong Boy
3381   Hath an Aspect of intercession, which
3382   Great Nature cries, Deny not. Let the Volces
3383   Plough Rome, and harrow Italy, Ile neuer
3384   Be such a Gosling to obey instinct; but stand
3385  *As if a man were Author of himself, & knew no other kin
3386   <S {Virgil}.> My Lord and Husband.
3387   <S {Corio}.> These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
3388   <S {Virg}.> The sorrow that deliuers vs thus chang'd,
3389   Makes you thinke so.
3390   <S {Corio}.> Like a dull Actor now, I haue forgot my part,
3391  *And I am out, euen to a full Disgrace. Best of my Flesh,
3392   Forgiue my Tyranny: but do  not say,
3393   For that forgiue our Romanes. O a kisse
3394   Long as my Exile, sweet as my Reuenge!
3395   Now by the iealous Queene of Heauen, that kisse
3396   I carried from thee deare; and my true Lippe
3397   Hath Virgin'd it ere since. You Gods, I pray,
3398   And the most noble Mother of the world
3399   Leaue vnsaluted: Sinke my knee i'th' earth,  <D {Kneeles}>
3400   Of thy deepe duty, more impression shew
3401   Then that of common Sonnes.
3402   <S {Volum}.> Oh stand vp blest!
3403   Whil'st with no softer Cushion then the Flint
3404   I kneele before thee, and vnproperly
3405   Shew duty as mistaken, all this while,
3406   Betweene the Childe, and Parent.
3407   <S {Corio}.> What's this? your knees to me?
3408   To your Corrected Sonne?
3409   Then let the Pibbles on the hungry beach
3410   Fillop the Starres: Then, let the mutinous windes
3411   Strike the proud Cedars 'gainst the fiery Sun:
3412   Murd'ring Impossibility, to make
3413   What cannot be, slight worke.
3414  *<S {Volum}.> Thou art my Warriour, I hope to frame thee
3415   Do you know this Lady?
3416   <S {Corio}.> The Noble Sister of {Publicola};
3417   The Moone of Rome: Chaste as the Isicle
3418   That's curdied by the Frost, from purest Snow,
3419   And hangs on {Dians} Temple: Deere {Valeria}.
3420   <S {Volum}.> This is a poore Epitome of yours,
3421   Which by th' interpretation of full time,
3422   May shew like all your selfe.
3423   <S {Corio}.> The God of Souldiers:
3424   With the consent of supreame Ioue, informe
3425   Thy thoughts with Noblenesse, that thou mayst proue
3426   To shame vnvulnerable, and sticke i'th Warres
3427   Like a great Sea- marke standing euery flaw,
3428   And sauing those that eye thee.
3429   <S {Volum}.> Your knee, Sirrah.
3430   <S {Corio}.> That's my braue Boy.
3431   <S {Volum}.> Euen he, your wife, this Ladie, and my selfe,
3432   Are Sutors to you.
3433   <S {Corio}.> I beseech you peace:
3434   Or if you'ld aske, remember this before;
3435   The thing I haue forsworne to graunt, may neuer
3436   Be held by you  denials. Do not bid me
3437   Dismisse my Soldiers, or capitulate
3438   Againe, with Romes Mechanickes. Tell me not
3439   Wherein I seeme vnnaturall: Desire not t' allay
3440   My Rages and Reuenges, with your colder reasons.
3441   <S {Volum}.> Oh no more, no more:
3442   You haue said you will not grant vs any thing:
3443   For we haue nothing else to aske, but that
3444   Which you deny already: yet we will aske,
3445   That if you faile in our request, the blame
3446   May hang vpon your hardnesse, therefore heare vs.
3447   <S {Corio}.> {Auffidius}, and you Volces marke, for wee'l
3448   Heare nought from Rome in priuate. Your request?
3449  *<S {Volum}.> Should we be silent & not speak, our Raiment
3450   And state of Bodies would bewray what life
3451   We haue led since thy Exile. Thinke with thy selfe,
3452   How more vnfortunate then all liuing women
3453   Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
3454  *Make our eies flow with ioy, harts dance with comforts,
3455  *Constraines them weepe, and shake with feare & sorow,
3456   Making the Mother, wife, and Childe to see,
3457   The Sonne, the Husband, and the Father tearing
3458   His Countries Bowels out; and to poore we
3459   Thine enmities most capitall: Thou barr'st vs
3460   Our prayers to the Gods, which is a comfort
3461   That all but we enioy. For how can we?
3462   Alas! how can we, for our Country pray?
3463   Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory:
3464   Whereto we are bound: Alacke, or we must loose
3465   The Countrie our deere Nurse, or else thy person
3466   Our comfort in the Country. We must finde
3467   An euident Calamity, though we had
3468   Our wish, which side should win. For either thou
3469   Must as a Forraine Recreant be led
3470   With Manacles through our streets, or else
3471   Triumphantly treade on thy Countries ruine,
      <P cc2v>
3472   And beare the Palme, for hauing brauely shed
3473   Thy Wife and Childrens blood: For my selfe, Sonne,
3474   I purpose not to waite on Fortune, till
3475   These warres determine: If I cannot perswade thee,
3476   Rather to shew a Noble grace to both parts,
3477   Then seeke the end of one; thou shalt no sooner
3478   March to assault thy Country, then to treade
3479   (Trust too't, thou shalt not) on thy Mothers wombe
3480   That brought thee to this world.
3481   <S {Virg}.> #I, and mine, that brought you forth this boy,
3482   To keepe your name liuing to time.
3483   <S {Boy}.> #A shall not tread on me: Ile run away
3484   Till I am bigger, but then Ile fight.
3485   <S {Corio}.> Not of a womans tendernesse to be,
3486   Requires nor Childe, nor womans face to see:
3487   I haue sate too long.
3488   <S {Volum}.> Nay, go not from vs thus:
3489   If it were so, that our request did tend
3490   To saue the Romanes, thereby to destroy
3491   The Volces whom you serue, you might condemne vs
3492   As poysonous of your Honour. No, our suite
3493   Is that you reconcile them: While the Volces
3494   May say, this mercy we haue shew'd: the Romanes,
3495   This we receiu'd, and each in either side
3496   Giue the All- haile to thee, and cry be Blest
3497  *For making vp this peace. Thou know'st (great Sonne)
3498   The end of Warres vncertaine: but this certaine,
3499   That if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
3500   Which thou shalt thereby reape, is such a name
3501   Whose repetition will be dogg'd with Curses:
3502   Whose Chronicle thus writ, The man was Noble,
3503   But with his last Attempt, he wip'd it out:
3504   Destroy'd his Country, and his name remaines
3505   To th' insuing Age, abhorr'd. Speake to me Son:
3506   Thou hast affected the fiue straines of Honor,
3507   To imitate the graces of the Gods.
3508   To teare with Thunder the wide Cheekes a'th' Ayre,
3509   And yet to change thy Sulphure with a Boult
3510   That should but riue an Oake. Why do'st not speake?
3511   Think'st thou it Honourable for a Nobleman
3512   Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speake you:
3513   He cares not for your weeping. Speake thou Boy,
3514   Perhaps thy childishnesse will moue him more
3515   Then can our Reasons. There's no man in the world
3516   More bound to's Mother, yet heere he let's me prate
3517   Like one i'th' Stockes. Thou hast neuer in thy life,
3518   Shew'd thy deere Mother any curtesie,
3519   When she (poor Hen) fond of no second brood,
3520   Ha's clock'd thee to the Warres: and safelie home
3521   Loden with Honor. Say my Request's vniust,
3522   And spurne me backe: But, if it be not so
3523   Thou art not honest, and the Gods will plague thee
3524   That thou restrain'st from me the Duty, which
3525   To a Mothers part belongs. He turnes away:
3526  *Down Ladies: let vs shame him with him with our knees
3527   To his sur- name {Coriolanus} longs more pride
3528   Then pitty to our Prayers. Downe: an end,
3529   This is the last. So, we will home to Rome,
3530   And dye among our Neighbours: Nay, behold's,
3531   This Boy that cannot tell what he would haue,
3532   But kneeles, and holds vp hands for fellowship,
3533   Doe's reason our Petition with more strength
3534   Then thou hast to deny't. Come, let vs go:
3535   This Fellow had a Volcean to his Mother:
3536   His Wife is in {Corioles}, and his Childe
3537   Like him by chance: yet giue vs our dispatch:
3538  *I am husht vntill our City be afire, & then Ile speak a litle
3539   <D {Holds her by the hand silent}.>
3540   <S {Corio}.> O Mother, Mother!
3541   What haue you done? Behold, the Heauens do ope,
3542   The Gods looke downe, and this vnnaturall Scene
3543   They laugh at. Oh my Mother, Mother: Oh!
3544   You haue wonne a happy Victory to Rome.
3545   But for your Sonne, beleeue it: Oh beleeue it,
3546   Most dangerously you haue with him preuail'd,
3547   If not most mortall to him. But let it come:
3548   {Auffidius}, though I cannot make true Warres,
3549   Ile frame conuenient peace. Now good {Auffidius},
3550   Were you in my steed, would you haue heard
3551   A Mother lesse? or granted lesse {Auffidius}?
3552   <S {Auf}.> I was mou'd withall.
3553   <S {Corio}.> I dare be sworne you were:
3554   And sir, it is no little thing to make
3555   Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But (good sir)
3556   What peace you'l make, aduise me: For my part,
3557   Ile not to Rome, Ile backe with you, and pray you
3558   Stand to me in this cause. Oh Mother! Wife!
3559  *<S {Auf}.> I am glad thou hast set thy mercy, & thy Honor
3560   At difference in thee: Out of that Ile worke
3561   My selfe a former Fortune.
3562   <S {Corio}.> #I #by and by; But we will drinke together:
3563   And you shall beare
3564   A better witnesse backe then words, which we
3565   On like conditions, will haue Counter- seal'd.
3566   Come enter with vs: Ladies you deserue
3567   To haue a Temple built you: All the Swords
3568   In Italy, and her Confederate Armes
3569   Could not haue made this peace.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3570   <D {Enter Menenius and Sicinius}.>
3571  *<S {Mene}.> See you yon'd Coin a'th Capitol, yon'd corner |(stone?
3572   <S {Sicin}.> Why what of that?
3573  *<S {Mene}.> If it be possible for you to displace it with your
3574  *little finger, there is some hope the Ladies of Rome, espe-cially
3575  *his Mother, may preuaile with him. But I say, there
3576  *is no hope in't, our throats are sentenc'd, and stay vppon
3577   execution.
3578  *<S {Sicin}.> Is't possible, that so short a time can alter the
3579   condition of a man.
3580  *<S {Mene}.> There is differency between a Grub & a But-terfly,
3581  *yet your Butterfly was a Grub: this {Martius}, is
3582  *growne from Man to Dragon: He has wings, hee's more
3583   then a creeping thing.
3584   <S {Sicin}.> He lou'd his Mother deerely.
3585  *<S {Mene}.> So did he mee: and he no more remembers his
3586  *Mother now, then an eight yeare old horse. The tartnesse
3587  *of his face, sowres ripe Grapes. When he walks, he moues
3588  *like an Engine, and the ground shrinkes before his Trea-ding.
3589  *He is able to pierce a Corslet with his eye: Talkes
3590  *like a knell, and his hum is a Battery. He sits in his State,
3591  *as a thing made for {Alexander}. What he bids bee done, is
3592  *finisht with his bidding. He wants nothing of a God but
3593   Eternity, and a Heauen to Throne in.
3594   <S {Sicin}.> Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
3595  *<S {Mene}.> I paint him in the Character. Mark what mer-cy
3596  *his Mother shall bring from him: There is no more
3597  *mercy in him, then there is milke in a male- Tyger, that
3598   shall our poore City finde: and all this is long of you.
3599   <S {Sicin}.> The Gods be good vnto vs.
3600  *<S {Mene}.> No, in such a case the Gods will not bee good
3601  *vnto vs. When we banish'd him, we respected not them:
3602  *and he returning to breake our necks, they respect not vs.
3603   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
      <P cc3>
3604   <S {Mes}.> Sir, if you'ld saue your life, flye to your House,
3605   The Plebeians haue got your Fellow Tribune,
3606   And hale him vp and downe; all swearing, if
3607   The Romane Ladies bring not comfort home
3608   They'l giue him death by Inches.
3609   <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
3610   <S {Sicin}.> What's the Newes?
3611   <S {Mess}.> Good Newes, good newes, the Ladies haue |(preuayl'd.
3612   The Volcians are dislodg'd, and {Martius} gone:
3613   A merrier day did neuer yet greet Rome,
3614   No, not th' expulsion of the {Tarquins}.
3615   <S {Sicin}.> Friend, art thou certaine this is true?
3616   Is't most certaine.
3617   <S {Mes}.> As certaine as I know the Sun is fire:
3618   Where haue you lurk'd that you make doubt of it:
3619   Ne're through an Arch so hurried the blowne Tide,
3620  *As the recomforted through th' gates. Why harke you:
3621   <D {Trumpets, Hoboyes, Drums beate, altogether}.>
3622   The Trumpets, Sack- buts, Psalteries, and Fifes,
3623   Tabors, and Symboles, and the showting Romans,
3624   Make the Sunne dance. Hearke you.  <D {A shout within}>
3625   <S {Mene}.> This is good Newes:
3626   I will go meete the Ladies. This {Volumnia},
3627   Is worth of Consuls, Senators, Patricians,
3628   A City full: Of Tribunes such as you,
3629   A Sea and Land full: you haue pray'd well to day:
3630   This Morning, for ten thousand of your throates,
3631   I'de not haue giuen a doit. Harke, how they ioy.
3632   <D {Sound still with the Shouts}.>
3633   <S {Sicin}.> First, the Gods blesse you for your tydings:
3634   Next, accept my thankefulnesse.
3635  *<S {Mess}.> Sir, we haue all great cause to giue great thanks.
3636   <S {Sicin}.> They are neere the City.
3637   <S {Mes}.> Almost at point to enter.
3638   <S {Sicin}.> Wee'l meet them, and helpe the ioy.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3639   <D {Enter two Senators, with Ladies, passing ouer}
3640   {the Stage, with other Lords}.>
3641   <S {Sena}.> Behold our Patronnesse, the life of Rome:
3642   Call all your Tribes together, praise the Gods,
3643  *And make triumphant fires, strew Flowers before them:
3644   Vnshoot the noise that Banish'd {Martius};
3645   Repeale him, with the welcome of his Mother:
3646   Cry welcome Ladies, welcome.
3647   <S {All}.> Welcome Ladies, welcome.
3648   <D {A Flourish with Drummes & Trumpets}.>
3649   <D {Enter Tullus Auffidius, with Attendants}.>
3650   <S {Auf}.> Go tell the Lords a'th' City, I am heere:
3651   Deliuer them this Paper: hauing read it,
3652   Bid them repayre to th' Market place, where I
3653   Euen in theirs, and in the Commons eares
3654   Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse:
3655   The City Ports by this hath enter'd, and
3656   Intends t' appeare before the People, hoping
3657   To purge himselfe with words. Dispatch.
3658   <D {Enter} 3 {or} 4 {Conspirators of Auffidius Faction}.>
3659   Most Welcome.
3660   <S 1.{Con}.> How is it with our Generall?
3661   <S {Auf}.> Euen so, as with a man by his owne Almes im-poyson'd,
3662   and with his Charity slaine.
3663  *<S 2.{Con}.> Most Noble Sir, If you do hold the same intent
3664   Wherein you wisht vs parties: Wee'l deliuer you
3665   Of your great danger.
3666   <S {Auf}.> Sir, I cannot tell,
3667   We must proceed as we do finde the People.
3668   <S 3.{Con}.> The People will remaine vncertaine, whil'st
3669   'Twixt you there's difference: but the fall of either
3670   Makes the Suruiuor heyre of all.
3671   <S {Auf}.> I know it:
3672   And my pretext to strike at him, admits
3673   A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
3674   Mine Honor for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
3675   He watered his new Plants with dewes of Flattery,
3676   Seducing so my Friends: and to this end,
3677   He bow'd his Nature, neuer knowne before,
3678   But to be rough, vnswayable, and free.
3679   <S 3.{Consp}.> Sir, his stoutnesse
3680   When he did stand for Consull, which he lost
3681   By lacke of stooping.
3682   <S {Auf}.> That I would haue spoke of:
3683   Being banish'd for't, he came vnto my Harth,
3684   Presented to my knife his Throat: I tooke him,
3685   Made him ioynt- seruant with me: Gaue him way
3686   In all his owne desires: Nay, let him choose
3687   Out of my Files, his proiects, to accomplish
3688   My best and freshest men, seru'd his designements
3689   In mine owne person: holpe to reape the Fame
3690   Which he did end all his; and tooke some pride
3691   To do my selfe this wrong: Till at the last
3692   I seem'd his Follower, not Partner; and
3693   He wadg'd me with his Countenance, as if
3694   I had bin Mercenary.
3695   <S 1.{Con}.> So he did my Lord:
3696   The Army marueyl'd at it, and in the last,
3697   When he had carried Rome, and that we look'd
3698   For no lesse Spoile, then Glory.
3699   <S {Auf}.> There was it:
3700   For which my sinewes shall be stretcht vpon him,
3701   At a few drops of Womens rhewme, which are
3702   As cheape as Lies; he sold the Blood and Labour
3703   Of our great Action; therefore shall he dye,
3704   And Ile renew me in his fall. But hearke.
3705   <D {Drummes and Trumpets sounds, with great}
3706   {showts of the people}.>
3707  *<S 1.{Con}.> Your Natiue Towne you enter'd like a Poste,
3708   And had no welcomes home, but he returnes
3709   Splitting the Ayre with noyse.
3710   <S 2.{Con}.> And patient Fooles,
3711   Whose children he hath slaine, their base throats teare
3712   With giuing him glory.
3713   <S 3.{Con}.> Therefore at your vantage,
3714   Ere he expresse himselfe, or moue the people
3715   With what he would say, let him feele your Sword:
3716   Which we will second, when he lies along
3717   After your way. His Tale pronounc'd, shall bury
3718   His Reasons, with his Body.
3719   <S {Auf}.> Say no more. Heere come the Lords,
3720   <D {Enter the Lords of the City}.>
3721   <S {All} {Lords}.> You are most welcome home.
3722   <S {Auff}.> I haue not deseru'd it.
3723   But worthy Lords, haue you with heede perused
3724   What I haue written to you?
3725   <S {All}.> We haue.
3726   <S 1.{Lord}.>  And greeue to heare't:
3727   What faults he made before the last, I thinke
3728   Might haue found easie Fines: But there to end
3729   Where he was to begin, and giue away
3730   The benefit of our Leuies, answering vs
3731   With our owne charge: making a Treatie, where
3732   There was a yeelding; this admits no excuse.
      <P cc3v>
3733   <S {Auf}.> He approaches, you shall heare him.
3734  *<D {Enter Coriolanus marching with Drumme, and Colours. The}
3735   {Commoners being with him}.>
3736   <S {Corio}.> Haile Lords, I am return'd your Souldier:
3737   No more infected with my Countries loue
3738   Then when I parted hence: but still subsisting
3739   Vnder your great Command. You are to know,
3740   That prosperously I haue attempted, and
3741   With bloody passage led your Warres, euen to
3742  *The gates of Rome: Our spoiles we haue brought home
3743   Doth more then counterpoize a full third part
3744   The charges of the Action. We haue made peace
3745   With no lesse Honor to the {Antiates}
3746   Then shame to th' Romaines. And we heere deliuer
3747   Subscrib'd by'th' Consuls, and Patricians,
3748   Together with the Seale a'th Senat, what
3749   We haue compounded on.
3750   <S {Auf}.> Read it not Noble Lords,
3751   But tell the Traitor in the highest degree
3752   He hath abus'd your Powers.
3753   <S {Corio}.> Traitor? How now?
3754   <S {Auf}.> #I Traitor, {Martius}.
3755   <S {Corio}.> {Martius}?
3756   <S {Auf}.> #I  {Martius}, {Caius Martius}:  Do'st thou thinke
3757   Ile grace thee with that Robbery, thy stolne name
3758   {Coriolanus} in {Corioles}?
3759   You Lords and Heads a'th' State, perfidiously
3760   He ha's betray'd your businesse, and giuen vp
3761   For certaine drops of Salt, your City Rome:
3762   I say your City to his Wife and Mother,
3763   Breaking his Oath and Resolution, like
3764   A twist of rotten Silke, neuer admitting
3765   Counsaile a'th' warre: But at his Nurses teares
3766   He whin'd and roar'd away your Victory,
3767   That Pages blush'd at him, and men of heart
3768   Look'd wond'ring each at others.
3769   <S {Corio}.> Hear'st thou Mars?
3770   <S {Auf}.> Name not the God, thou boy of Teares.
3771   <S {Corio}.> Ha?
3772   <S {Aufid}.> No more.
3773   <S {Corio}.> Measurelesse Lyar, thou hast made my heart
3774   Too great for what containes it. Boy? Oh Slaue,
3775   Pardon me Lords, 'tis the first time that euer
3776  *I was forc'd to scoul'd. Your iudgments my graue Lords
3777   Must giue this Curre the Lye: and his owne Notion,
3778   Who weares my stripes imprest vpon him, that
3779   Must beare my beating to his Graue, shall ioyne
3780   To thrust the Lye vnto him.
3781   <S 1 {Lord}.> Peace both, and heare me speake.
3782   <S {Corio}.> Cut me to peeces Volces men and Lads,
3783   Staine all your edges on me. Boy, false Hound:
3784   If you haue writ your Annales true, 'tis there,
3785   That like an Eagle in a Doue- coat, I
3786   Flatter'd your Volcians in {Corioles}.
3787   Alone I did it, Boy.
3788   <S {Auf}.> Why Noble Lords,
3789   Will you be put in minde of his blinde Fortune,
3790   Which was your shame, by this vnholy Braggart?
3791   'Fore your owne eyes, and eares?
3792   <S {All} {Consp}.> Let him dye for't.
3793   <S {All} {People}.> Teare him to peeces, do it presently:
3794   He kill'd my Sonne, my daughter, he kill'd my Cosine
3795   {Marcus}, he kill'd my Father.
3796   <S 2 {Lord}.> Peace hoe: no outrage, peace:
3797   The man is Noble, and his Fame folds in
3798   This Orbe o'th' earth: His last offences to vs
3799   Shall haue Iudicious hearing. Stand {Auffidius},
3800   And trouble not the peace.
3801  *<S {Corio}.> O that I had him, with six {Auffidiusses}, or more:
3802   His Tribe, to vse my lawfull Sword.
3803   <S {Auf}.> Insolent Villaine.
3804   <S {All} {Consp}.> Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him.
3805   <D {Draw both the Conspirators, and kils Martius, who}
3806   {falles, Auffidius stands on him}.>
3807   <S {Lords}.> Hold, hold, hold, hold.
3808   <S {Auf}.> My Noble Masters, heare me speake.
3809   <S 1.{Lord}.> O {Tullus}.
3810   <S 2.{Lord}.> Thou hast done a deed, whereat
3811   Valour will weepe.
3812   <S 3.{Lord}.> Tread not vpon him Masters, all be quiet,
3813   Put vp your Swords.
3814   <S {Auf}.> My Lords,
3815   When you shall know (as in this Rage
3816   Prouok'd by him, you cannot) the great danger
3817   Which this mans life did owe you, you'l reioyce
3818   That he is thus cut off. Please it your Honours
3819   To call me to your Senate, Ile deliuer
3820   My selfe your loyall Seruant, or endure
3821   Your heauiest Censure.
3822   <S 1.{Lord}.> Beare from hence his body,
3823   And mourne you for him. Let him be regarded
3824   As the most Noble Coarse, that euer Herald
3825   Did follow to his Vrne.
3826   <S 2.{Lord}.> His owne impatience,
3827   Takes from {Auffidius} a great part of blame:
3828   Let's make the Best of it.
3829   <S {Auf}.> My Rage is gone,
3830   And I am strucke with sorrow. Take him vp:
3831   Helpe three a'th' cheefest Souldiers, Ile be one.
3832   Beate thou the Drumme that it speake mournfully:
3833   Traile your steele Pikes. Though in this City hee
3834   Hath widdowed and vnchilded many a one,
3835   Which to this houre bewaile the Iniury,
3836   Yet he shall haue a Noble Memory. Assist.
