35     <D {Enter the Duke of Norfolke at one doore. At the other},
36     {the Duke of Buckingham, and the Lord}
37     {Aburgauenny}.>
38     <S {Buckingham}.>
39     Good morrow, and well met. How haue ye done
40     Since last we saw in France?
41     <S {Norf}.> I thanke your Grace:
42     Healthfull, and euer since a fresh Admirer
43     Of what I saw there.
44     <S {Buck}.> An vntimely Ague
45     Staid me a Prisoner in my Chamber, when
46     Those Sunnes of Glory, those two Lights of Men
47     Met in the vale of Andren.
48     <S {Nor}.> 'Twixt Guynes and Arde,
49     I was then present, saw them salute on Horsebacke,
50     Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung
51     In their Embracement, as they grew together,
52     Which had they,
53     What foure Thron'd ones could haue weigh'd
54     Such a compounded one?
55     <S {Buck}.> All the whole time
56     I was my Chambers Prisoner.
57     <S {Nor}.> Then you lost
58     The view of earthly glory: Men might say
59     Till this time Pompe was single, but now married
60     To one aboue it selfe. Each following day
61     Became the next dayes master, till the last
62     Made former Wonders, it's. To day the French,
63     All Clinquant all in Gold, like Heathen Gods
64     Shone downe the English; and to morrow, they
65     Made Britaine, India: Euery man that stood,
66     Shew'd like a  #Mine. Their Dwarfish Pages were
67     As Cherubins, all gilt: the Madams too,
68     Not vs'd to toyle, did almost sweat to beare
69     The Pride vpon them, that their very labour
70     Was to them, as a Painting. Now this Maske
71     Was cry'de incompareable; and th' ensuing night
72     Made it a Foole, and Begger. The two Kings
73     Equall in lustre, were now best, now worst
74     As presence did present them: Him in eye,
75     Still him in praise, and being present both,
76     'Twas said they saw but one, and no Discerner
77     Durst wagge his Tongue in censure, when these Sunnes
78     (For so they phrase 'em) by their Heralds challeng'd
79     The Noble Spirits to Armes, they did performe
      <P t3v>
80     Beyond thoughts Compasse, that former fabulous Storie
81     Being now seene, possible enough, got credit
82     That {Beuis} was beleeu'd.
83     <S {Buc}.> Oh you go farre.
84     <S {Nor}.> As I belong to worship, and affect
85     In Honor, Honesty, the tract of eu'ry thing,
86     Would by a good Discourser loose some life,
87     Which Actions selfe, was tongue #too.
88     <S {Buc}.> All was Royall,
89     To the disposing of it nought rebell'd,
90     Order gaue each thing view. The Office did
91     Distinctly his full Function: who did guide,
92     I meane who set the Body, and the Limbes
93     Of this great Sport together?
94     <S {Nor}.> As you guesse:
95     One certes, that promises no Element
96     In such a businesse.
97     <S {Buc}.> I pray you who, my Lord?
98     <S {Nor}.> All this was ordred by the good Discretion
99     Of the right Reuerend Cardinall of Yorke.
100    <S {Buc}.> The diuell speed him: No mans Pye is freed
101    From his Ambitious finger. What had he
102    To do in these fierce Vanities? I wonder,
103    That such a Keech can with his very bulke
104    Take vp the Rayes o'th' beneficiall Sun,
105    And keepe it from the Earth.
106    <S {Nor}.> Surely Sir,
107    There's in him stuffe, that put's him to these ends:
108    For being not propt by Auncestry, whose grace
109    Chalkes Successors their way; nor call'd vpon
110    For high feats done to'th' Crowne; neither Allied
111    To eminent Assistants; but Spider- like
112    Out of his Selfe- drawing Web. #O giues vs note,
113    The force of his owne merit makes his way
114    A guift that heauen giues for him, which buyes
115    A place next to the King.
116    <S {Abur}.> I cannot tell
117    What Heauen hath giuen him: let some Grauer eye
118    Pierce into that, but I can see his Pride
119    Peepe through each part of him: whence ha's he that,
120    If not from #Hell? The Diuell is a Niggard,
121    Or #ha's giuen all before, and he begins
122    A new #Hell in himselfe.
123    <S {Buc}.> Why the Diuell,
124    Vpon this French going out, tooke he vpon him
125    (Without the priuity o'th' King) t' appoint
126    Who should attend on him? He makes vp the File
127    Of all the Gentry; for the most part such
128    To whom as great a Charge, as little Honor
129    He meant to lay vpon: and his owne Letter
130    The Honourable Boord of Councell, out
131    Must fetch him in, he Papers.
132    <S {Abur}.> I do know
133    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that haue
134    By this, so sicken'd their Estates, that neuer
135    They shall abound as formerly.
136    <S {Buc}.> O many
137    Haue broke their backes with laying Mannors on 'em
138    For this great Iourney. What did this vanity
139    But minister communication of
140    A most poore issue.
141    <S {Nor}.> Greeuingly I thinke,
142    The Peace betweene the French and vs, not valewes
143    The Cost that did conclude it.
144    <S {Buc}.> Euery man,
145    After the hideous storme that follow'd, was
146    A thing Inspir'd, and not consulting, broke
147    Into a generall Prophesie; That this Tempest
148    Dashing the Garment of this Peace, aboaded
149    The sodaine breach on't.
150    <S {Nor}.> Which is budded out,
151    For France hath flaw'd the League, and hath attach'd
152    Our Merchants goods at Burdeux.
153    <S {Abur}.> Is it therefore
154    Th' Ambassador is silenc'd?
155    <S {Nor}.> Marry is't.
156    <S {Abur}.> A proper Title of a Peace, and purchas'd
157    At a superfluous rate.
158    <S {Buc}.> Why all this Businesse
159    Our Reuerend Cardinall carried.
160    <S {Nor}.> Like it your Grace,
161    The State takes notice of the priuate difference
162    Betwixt you, and the Cardinall. I aduise you
163    (And take it from a heart, that wishes towards you
164    Honor, and plenteous safety) that you reade
165    The Cardinals Malice, and his Potency
166    Together; To consider further, that
167    What his high Hatred would effect, wants not
168    A Minister in his Power. You know his Nature,
169    That he's Reuengefull; and I know, his Sword
170    Hath a sharpe edge: It's long, and't may be saide
171    It reaches farre, and where 'twill not extend,
172    Thither he darts it. Bosome vp my counsell,
173   *You'l finde it wholesome. Loe, where comes that Rock
174    That I aduice your shunning.
175   *<D {Enter Cardinall Wolsey, the Purse borne before him, certaine}
176    {of the Guard, and two Secretaries with Papers: The}
177    {Cardinall in his passage, fixeth his eye on Buck-ingham},
178    {and Buckingham on him},
179    {both full of disdaine}.>
180    <S {Car}.> The Duke of {Buckinghams} Surueyor? Ha?
181    Where's his Examination?
182    <S {Secr}.> Heere so please you.
183    <S {Car}.> Is he in person, ready?
184    <S {Secr}.> #I, please your Grace.
185   *<S {Car}.> Well, we shall then know more, & {Buckingham}
186    Shall lessen this bigge looke.
187    <D {Exeunt Cardinall, and his Traine}.>
188   *<S {Buc}.> This Butchers Curre is venom'd- mouth'd, and I
189    Haue not the power to muzzle him, therefore best
190    Not wake him in his slumber. A Beggers booke,
191    Out- worths a Nobles blood.
192    <S {Nor}.> What are you chaff'd?
193    Aske God for Temp'rance, that's th' appliance onely
194    Which your disease requires.
195    <S {Buc}.> I read in's looks
196    Matter against me, and his eye reuil'd
197    Me as his abiect obiect, at this instant
198    He bores me with some tricke; He's gone to'th' King:
199    Ile follow, and out- stare him.
200    <S {Nor}.> Stay my Lord,
201    And let your Reason with your Choller question
202    What 'tis you go about: to climbe steepe hilles
203    Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like
204    A full hot Horse, who being allow'd his way
205    Selfe- mettle tyres him: Not a man in England
206    Can aduise me like you: Be to your selfe,
207    As you would to your Friend.
208    <S {Buc}.> Ile to the King,
209    And from a mouth of Honor, quite cry downe
      <P t4><C I>
210    This {Ipswich} fellowes insolence; or proclaime,
211    There's difference in no persons.
212    <S {Norf}.> Be aduis'd;
213    Heat not a Furnace for your foe so hot
214    That it do sindge your selfe. We may out- runne
215    By violent swiftnesse that which we run at;
216    And lose by ouer- running: know you not,
217    The fire that mounts the liquor til't run ore,
218    In seeming to augment it, wasts it: be aduis'd;
219    I say againe there is no English Soule
220    More stronger to direct you then your selfe;
221    If with the sap of reason you would quench,
222    Or but allay the fire of passion.
223    <S {Buck}.> Sir,
224    I am thankfull to you, and Ile goe along
225    By your prescription: but this top- proud fellow,
226    Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but
227    From sincere motions, by Intelligence,
228    And proofes as cleere as Founts in {Iuly}, when
229    Wee see each graine of grauell; I doe know
230    To be corrupt and treasonous.
231    <S {Norf}.> Say not treasonous.
232   *<S {Buck}.> To th' King Ile say't, & make my vouch as strong
233    As shore of Rocke: attend. This holy Foxe,
234    Or Wolfe, or both (for he is equall rau'nous
235    As he is subtile, and as prone to mischiefe,
236    As able to perform't) his minde, and place
237    Infecting one another, yea reciprocally,
238    Only to shew his pompe, as well in France,
239    As here at home, suggests the King our Master
240    To this last costly Treaty: Th' enteruiew,
241    That swallowed so much treasure, and like a glasse
242    Did breake ith' wrenching.
243    <S {Norf}.> Faith, and so it did.
244   *<S {Buck}.> Pray giue me fauour Sir: This cunning Cardinall
245    The Articles o'th' Combination drew
246    As himselfe pleas'd; and they were ratified
247    As he cride thus let be, to as much end,
248   *As giue a Crutch to th' dead. But our Count- Cardinall
249    Has done this, and tis well: for worthy {Wolsey}
250    (Who cannot erre) he did it. Now this followes,
251    (Which as I take it, is a kinde of Puppie
252    To th' old dam Treason) {Charles} the Emperour,
253    Vnder pretence to see the Queene his Aunt,
254    (For twas indeed his colour, but he came
255    To whisper {Wolsey}) here makes visitation,
256    His feares were that the Interview betwixt
257    England and France, might through their amity
258    Breed him some preiudice; for from this League,
259    Peep'd harmes that menac'd him. Priuily
260    Deales with our Cardinal, and as I troa
261    Which I doe well; for I am sure the Emperour
262    Paid ere he promis'd, whereby his Suit was granted
263    Ere it was ask'd. But when the way was made
264    And pau'd with gold: the Emperor thus desir'd,
265    That he would please to alter the Kings course,
266    And breake the foresaid peace. Let the King know
267    (As soone he shall by me) that thus the Cardinall
268    Does buy and sell his Honour as he pleases,
269    And for his owne aduantage.
270    <S {Norf}.> I am sorry
271    To heare this of him; and could wish he were
272    Somthing mistaken in't.
273    <S {Buck}.> No, not a sillable:
274    I doe pronounce him in that very shape
275    He shall appeare in proofe.
276    <D {Enter Brandon, a Sergeant at Armes before him, and}
277    {two or three of the Guard}.>
278    <S {Brandon}.> Your Office Sergeant: execute it.
279    <S {Sergeant}.> Sir,
280    My Lord the Duke of {Buckingham}, and Earle
281    Of {Hertford}, {Stafford} and {Northampton}, I
282    Arrest thee of High Treason, in the name
283    Of our most Soueraigne King.
284    <S {Buck}.> Lo you my Lord,
285    The net has falne vpon me, I shall perish
286    Vnder deuice, and practise.
287    <S {Bran}.> I am sorry,
288    To see you tane from liberty, to looke on
289    The busines present. Tis his Highnes pleasure
290    You shall to th' Tower.
291    <S {Buck}.> It will helpe me nothing
292    To plead mine Innocence; for that dye is on me
293   *Which makes my whit'st part, black. The #will of Heau'n
294    Be done in this and all things: I obey.
295    O my Lord {Aburgany}: Fare you well.
296    <S {Bran}.> Nay, he must beare you company. The King
297    Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know
298    How he determines further.
299    <S {Abur}.> As the Duke said,
300    The #will of Heauen be done, and the Kings pleasure
301    By me obey'd.
302    <S {Bran}.> Here is a warrant from
303    The King, t' attach Lord {Mountacute}, and the Bodies
304    Of the Dukes Confessor, {Iohn de la Car},
305    One {Gilbert Pecke}, his Councellour.
306    <S {Buck}.> So, so;
307    These are the limbs o'th' Plot: no more I hope.
308    <S {Bra}.> A Monke o'th' {Chartreux}.
309    <S {Buck}.> O {Michaell Hopkins}?
310    <S {Bra}.> He.
311   *<S {Buck}.> My Surueyor is falce: The ore-great {Cardinall}
312    Hath shew'd him gold; my life is spand already:
313    I am the shadow of poore {Buckingham},
314    Whose Figure euen this instant Clowd puts on,
315    By Darkning my cleere Sunne. My Lords farewell.  <D {Exe}.>
316    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
317   *<D {Cornets. Enter King Henry, leaning on the Cardinals shoul-der},
318    {the Nobles, and Sir Thomas Louell: the Cardinall}
319    {places himselfe vnder the Kings feete on}
320    {his right side}.>
321    <S {King}.> My life it selfe, and the best heart of it,
322    Thankes you for this great care: I stood i'th' leuell
323    Of a full- charg'd confederacie, and giue thankes
324    To you that choak'd it. Let be cald before vs
325    That Gentleman of {Buckinghams},  in person,
326    Ile heare him his confessions iustifie,
327    And point by point the Treasons of his Maister,
328    He shall againe relate.
329   *<D {A noyse within crying roome for the Queene, vsher'd by the}

332    {takes her vp, kisses and placeth}
333    {her by him}.>
334    <S {Queen}.> Nay, we must longer kneele; I am a Suitor.
335    <S King.> Arise, and take place by vs; halfe your Suit
336    Neuer name to vs; you haue halfe our power:
      <P t4v>
337    The other moity ere you aske is giuen,
338    Repeat your #will, and take it.
339    <S {Queen}.> Thanke your Maiesty
340    That you would loue your selfe, and in that loue
341    Not vnconsidered leaue your Honour, nor
342    The dignity of your Office; is the poynt
343    Of my Petition.
344    <S {Kin}.> Lady mine proceed.
345    <S {Queen}.> I am solicited not by a few,
346    And those of true condition; That your Subiects
347   *Are in great grieuance: There haue beene Commissions
348    Sent downe among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
349    Of all their Loyalties; wherein, although
350    My good Lord Cardinall, they vent reproches
351    Most bitterly on you, as putter on
352    Of these exactions: yet the King, our Maister
353   *Whose Honor Heauen shield from soile; euen he escapes |(not
354    Language vnmannerly; yea, such which breakes
355    The sides of loyalty, and almost appeares
356    In lowd Rebellion.
357    <S {Norf}.> Not almost appeares,
358    It doth appeare; for, vpon these Taxations,
359    The Clothiers all not able to maintaine
360    The many to them longing, haue put off
361    The Spinsters, Carders, Fullers, Weauers, who
362    Vnfit for other life, compeld by hunger
363    And lack of other meanes, in desperate manner
364    Daring th' euent #too th' teeth, are all in vprore,
365    And danger serues among them.
366    <S {Kin}.> Taxation?
367    Wherein? and what Taxation? My Lord Cardinall,
368    You that are blam'd for it alike with vs,
369    Know you of this Taxation?
370    <S {Card}.> Please you Sir,
371    I know but of a single part in ought
372    Pertaines to th' State; and front but in that File
373    Where others tell steps with me.
374    <S {Queen}.> No, my Lord?
375    You know no more then others? But you frame
376    Things that are knowne alike, which are not wholsome
377    To those which would not know them, and yet must
378    Perforce be  their acquaintance. These exactions
379    (Whereof my Soueraigne would haue note) they are
380    Most pestilent to th' hearing, and to beare 'em,
381    The Backe is Sacrifice to th' load; They say
382    They are deuis'd by you, or else you suffer
383    Too hard an exclamation.
384    <S {Kin}.> Still Exaction:
385    The nature of it, in what kinde let's know,
386    Is this Exaction?
387    <S {Queen}.> I am much too venturous
388    In tempting of your patience, but am boldned
389    Vnder your promis'd pardon. The Subiects griefe
390   *Comes through Commissions, which compels from each
391    The sixt part of his Substance, to be leuied
392    Without delay; and the pretence for this
393   *Is nam'd, your warres in France: this makes bold mouths,
394    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
395    Allegeance in them; their curses now
396    Liue where their prayers did: and it's come to passe,
397    This tractable obedience is a Slaue
398    To each incensed #Will: I would your Highnesse
399    Would giue it quicke consideration; for
400    There is no primer basenesse.
401    <S {Kin}.> By my life,
402    This is against our pleasure.
403    <S {Card}.> And for me,
404    I haue no further gone in this, then by
405    A single voice, and that not past me, but
406    By learned approbation of the Iudges: If I am
407    Traduc'd by ignorant Tongues, which neither know
408    My faculties nor person, yet will be
409    The Chronicles of my doing: Let me say,
410    'Tis but the fate of Place, and the rough Brake
411    That Vertue must goe through: we must not stint
412    Our necessary actions, in the feare
413    To cope malicious Censurers, which euer,
414    As rau'nous Fishes doe a Vessell follow
415    That is new trim'd; but benefit no further
416    Then vainly longing. What we oft doe best,
417    By sicke Interpreters (once weake ones) is
418    Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft
419    Hitting a grosser quality, is cride vp
420    For our best Act: if we shall stand still,
421    In feare our motion will be mock'd, or carp'd at,
422    We should take roote here, where we sit;
423    Or sit State- Statues onely.
424    <S {Kin}.> Things done well,
425    And with a care, exempt themselues from feare:
426    Things done without example, in their issue
427    Are to be fear'd. Haue you a President
428    Of this Commission? I beleeue, not any.
429    We must not rend our Subiects from our Lawes,
430    And sticke them in our #Will. Sixt part of each?
431    A trembling Contribution; why we take
432    From euery Tree, lop, barke, and part o'th' Timber:
433    And though we leaue it with a roote thus hackt,
434    The Ayre will drinke the Sap. To euery County
435    Where this is question'd, send our Letters, with
436    Free pardon to each man that has deny'de
437    The force of this Commission: pray looke too't;
438    I put it to your care.
439    <S {Card}.> A word with you.
440    Let there be Letters writ to euery Shire,
441   *Of the Kings grace and pardon: the greeued Commons
442    Hardly conceiue of me. Let it be nois'd,
443    That through our Intercession, this Reuokement
444    And pardon comes: I shall anon aduise you
445    Further in the proceeding.  <D {Exit Secret[ary]}.>
446    <D {Enter Surueyor}.>
447    <S {Queen}.> I am sorry, that the Duke of {Buckingham}
448    Is run in your displeasure.
449    <S {Kin}.> It grieues many:
450    The Gentleman is Learn'd, and a most rare Speaker,
451    To Nature none more bound; his trayning such,
452    That he may furnish and instruct great Teachers,
453    And neuer seeke for ayd out of himselfe: yet see,
454    When these so Noble benefits shall proue
455    Not well dispos'd, the minde growing once corrupt,
456    They turne to vicious formes, ten times more vgly
457    Then euer they were faire. This man so compleat,
458    Who was enrold 'mongst wonders; and when we
459    Almost with rauish'd listning, could not finde
460    His houre of speech, a minute: He, (my Lady)
461    Hath into monstrous habits put the Graces
462    That once were his, and is become as blacke,
463    As if besmear'd in #hell. Sit by Vs, you shall heare
464    (This was his Gentleman in trust) of him
465    Things to strike Honour sad. Bid him recount
466    The fore- recited practises, whereof
467    We cannot feele too little, heare too much.
      <P t5>
468   *<S {Card}.> Stand forth, & with bold spirit relate what you
469    Most like a carefull Subiect haue collected
470    Out of the Duke of {Buckingham}.
471    <S {Kin}.> Speake freely.
472    <S {Sur}.> First, it was vsuall with him; euery day
473    It would infect his Speech: That if the King
474    Should without issue dye; hee'l carry it so
475    To make the Scepter his. These very words
476    I'ue heard him vtter to his Sonne in Law,
477    Lord {Aburgany}, to whom by oth he menac'd
478    Reuenge vpon the {Cardinall}.
479    <S {Card}.> Please your Highnesse note
480    This dangerous conception in this point,
481    Not frended by his wish to your High person;
482    His #will is most malignant, and it stretches
483    Beyond you to your friends.
484    <S {Queen}.> My learn'd Lord {Cardinall},
485    Deliuer all with Charity.
486    <S {Kin}.> Speake on;
487    How grounded hee his Title to the Crowne
488    Vpon our faile; to this poynt hast thou heard him,
489    At any time speake ought?
490    <S {Sur}.> He was brought to this,
491    By a vaine Prophesie of {Nicholas Henton}.
492    <S {Kin}.> What was that {Henton}?
493    <S {Sur}.> Sir, a {Chartreux} Fryer,
494    His Confessor, who fed him euery minute
495    With words of Soueraignty.
496    <S {Kin}.> How know'st thou this?
497    <S {Sur}.> Not long before your Highnesse sped to France,
498    The Duke being at the Rose, within the Parish
499    Saint {Laurence Poultney}, did of me demand
500    What was the speech among the Londoners,
501    Concerning the French Iourney. I replide,
502    Men feare the French would proue perfidious
503    To the Kings danger: presently, the Duke
504    Said, 'twas the feare indeed, and that he doubted
505    'Twould proue the verity of certaine words
506    Spoke by a holy Monke, that oft, sayes he,
507    Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
508    {Iohn de la Car}, my Chaplaine, a choyce howre
509    To heare from him a matter of some moment:
510    Whom after vnder the Commissions Seale,
511    He sollemnly had sworne, that what he spoke
512    My Chaplaine to no Creature liuing, but
513    To me, should vtter, with demure Confidence,
514    This pausingly ensu'de; neither the King, nor's Heyres
515    (Tell you the Duke) shall prosper, bid him striue
516    To the loue o'th' Commonalty, the Duke
517    Shall gouerne England.
518    <S {Queen}.> If I know you well,
519    You were the Dukes Surueyor, and lost your Office
520    On the complaint o'th' Tenants; take good heed
521    You charge not in your spleene a Noble person,
522    And spoyle your nobler Soule; I say, take heed;
523    Yes, heartily beseech you.
524    <S {Kin}.> Let him on: Goe forward.
525    <S {Sur}.> On my Soule, Ile speake but truth.
526    I told my Lord the Duke, by th' Diuels illusions
527   *The Monke might be deceiu'd, and that 'twas dangerous
528    For this to ruminate on this so farre, vntill
529    It forg'd him some designe, which being beleeu'd
530    It was much like to doe: He answer'd, Tush,
531    It can do me no damage; adding further,
532    That had the King in his last Sicknesse faild,
533    The Cardinals and Sir {Thomas Louels} heads
534    Should haue gone off.
535    <S {Kin}.> Ha? What, so rancke? Ah, ha,
536    There's mischiefe in this man; canst thou say further?
537    <S {Sur}.> I can my Liedge.
538    <S {Kin}.> Proceed.
539    <S {Sur}.> Being at {Greenwich},
540    After your Highnesse had reprou'd the Duke
541    About Sir {William Blumer}.
542   *<S {Kin}.> I remember of such a time, being my sworn ser-|(uant,
543    The Duke retein'd him his. But on: what hence?
544    <S {Sur}.> If (quoth he) I for this had beene committed,
545    As to the Tower, I thought; I would haue plaid
546    The Part my Father meant to act vpon
547    Th' Vsurper {Richard}, who being at {Salsbury},
548    Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,
549    (As he made semblance of his duty) would
550    Haue put his knife into him.
551    <S {Kin}.> A Gyant Traytor.
552   *<S {Card}.> Now Madam, may his Highnes liue in freedome,
553    And this man out of Prison.
554    <S {Queen}.> God mend all.
555   *<S {Kin}.> Ther's somthing more would out of thee; what |(say'st?
556    <S {Sur}.> After the Duke his Father, with the knife
557    He stretch'd him, and with one hand on his dagger,
558    Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
559    He did discharge a horrible Oath, whose tenor
560    Was, were he euill vs'd, he would outgoe
561    His Father, by as much as a performance
562    Do's an irresolute purpose.
563    <S {Kin}.> There's his period,
564    To sheath his knife in vs: he is attach'd,
565    Call him to present tryall: if he may
566    Finde mercy in the Law, 'tis his; if none,
567    Let him not seek't of vs: By day and night
568    Hee's Traytor to th' height.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A F>
569    <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
570    <D {Enter L[ord]. Chamberlaine and L[ord]. Sandys}.>
571    <S {L.Ch}.> Is't possible the spels of France should iuggle
572    Men into such strange mysteries?
573    <S {L.San}.> New customes,
574    Though they be neuer so ridiculous,
575    (Nay let 'em be vnmanly) yet are follow'd.
576    <S {L.Ch}.> As farre as I see, all the good our English
577    Haue got by the late Voyage, is but meerely
578    A fit or two o'th' face, (but they are shrewd ones)
579    For when they hold 'em, you would sweare directly
580    Their very noses had been Councellours
581    To {Pepin} or {Clotharius}, they keepe State so.
582    <S {L.San}.> They haue all new legs,
583    And lame ones; one would take it,
584    That neuer see 'em pace before, the Spauen
585    A Spring- halt rain'd among 'em.
586    <S {L.Ch}.> Death my Lord,
587    Their cloathes are after such a Pagan cut too't,
588    That sure th'haue worne out Christendome: how now?
589    What newes, Sir {Thomas Louell}?
590    <D {Enter Sir Thomas Louell}.>
591    <S {Louell}.> Faith my Lord,
592    I heare of none but the new Proclamation,
593    That's clapt vpon the Court Gate.
      <P t5v>
594    <S {L.Cham}.> What is't for?
595    <S {Lou}.> The reformation of our trauel'd Gallants,
596    That fill the Court with quarrels, talke, and Taylors.
597    <S {L.Cham}.> I'm glad 'tis there;
598    Now I would pray our Monsieurs
599    To thinke an English Courtier may be wise,
600    And neuer see the {Louure}.
601    <S {Lou}.> They must either
602    (For so run the Conditions) leaue those remnants
603    Of Foole and Feather, that they got in France,
604    With all their honourable points of ignorance
605    Pertaining thereunto; as Fights and Fire- workes,
606    Abusing better men then they can be
607    Out of a forreigne wisedome, renouncing cleane
608    The faith they haue in Tennis and tall Stockings,
609    Short blistred Breeches, and those types of Trauell;
610    And vnderstand againe like honest men,
611    Or pack to their old Playfellowes; there, I take it,
612    They may {Cum Priuilegio}, #wee away
613    The lag end of their lewdnesse, and be laugh'd at.
614    <S {L.San}.> Tis time to giue 'em Physicke, their diseases
615    Are growne so catching.
616    <S {L.Cham}.> What a losse our Ladies
617    Will haue of these trim vanities?
618    <S {Louell}.> #I marry,
619    There will be woe indeed Lords, the slye whorsons
620    Haue got a speeding tricke to lay downe Ladies.
621    A French Song, and a Fiddle, ha's no Fellow.
622    <S {L.San}.> The Diuell fiddle 'em,
623    I am glad they are going,
624    For sure there's no conuerting of 'em: now
625    An honest Country Lord as I am, beaten
626    A long time out of play, may bring his plaine song,
627    And haue an houre of hearing, and by'r Lady
628    Held currant Musicke too.
629    <S {L.Cham}.> Well said Lord {Sands},
630    Your Colts tooth is not cast yet?
631    <S {L.San}.> No my Lord,
632    Nor shall not while I haue a stumpe.
633    <S {L.Cham}.> Sir {Thomas},
634    Whither were you #a going?
635    <S {Lou}.> To the Cardinals;
636    Your Lordship is a guest too.
637    <S {L.Cham}.> O, 'tis true;
638    This night he makes a Supper, and a great one,
639    To many Lords and Ladies; there will be
640    The Beauty of this Kingdome Ile assure you.
641    <S {Lou}.> That Churchman
642    Beares a bounteous minde indeed,
643    A hand as fruitfull as the Land that feeds vs,
644    His dewes fall euery where.
645    <S {L.Cham}.> No doubt hee's Noble;
646    He had a blacke mouth that said other of him.
647    <S {L.San}.> He may my Lord,
648    #Ha's wherewithall in him;
649    Sparing would shew a worse sinne, then #ill Doctrine,
650    Men of his way, should be most liberall,
651    They are set heere for examples.
652    <S {L.Cham}.> True, they are so;
653    But few now giue so great ones:
654    My Barge stayes;
655    Your Lordship shall along: Come,  good Sir {Thomas},
656    We shall be late else, which I would not be,
657    For I was spoke to, with Sir {Henry Guilford}
658    This night to be Comptrollers.
659    <S {L.San}.> I am your Lordships.  <D {Exeunt}.>

666    <S {S.Hen.Guilf}.> Ladyes,
667    A generall welcome from his Grace
668    Salutes ye all; This Night he dedicates
669    To faire content, and you: None heere he hopes
670    In all this Noble Beuy, has brought with her
671    One care abroad: hee would haue all as merry:
672    As first, good Company, good wine, good welcome,
673    Can make good people.
674    <D {Enter L[ord]. Chamberlaine L[ord]. Sands, and Louell}.>
675    O my Lord, y'are tardy;
676    The very thought of this faire Company,
677    Clapt wings to me.
678    <S {Cham}.> You are young Sir {Harry Guilford}.
679    <S {San}.> Sir {Thomas Louell}, had the Cardinall
680    But halfe my Lay- thoughts in him, some of these
681    Should finde a running Banket, ere they rested,
682    I thinke would better please 'em: by my life,
683    They are a sweet society of faire ones.
684   *<S {Lou}.> O that your Lordship were but now Confessor,
685    To one or two of these.
686    <S {San}.> I would I were,
687    They should finde easie pennance.
688    <S {Lou}.> Faith how easie?
689    <S {San}.> As easie as a downe bed would affoord it.
690    <S {Cham}.> Sweet Ladies will it please you sit; Sir {Harry}
691    Place you that side, Ile take the charge of this:
692    His Grace is entring. Nay, you must not freeze,
693    Two women plac'd together, makes cold weather:
694    My Lord {Sands}, you are one will keepe 'em waking:
695    Pray sit betweene these Ladies.
696    <S {San}.> By my faith,
697   *And thanke your Lordship: by your leaue sweet Ladies,
698    If I chance to talke a little wilde, forgiue me:
699    I had it from my Father.
700    <S {An.Bul}.> Was he mad Sir?
701    <S {San}.> O very mad, exceeding mad, in loue too;
702    But he would bite none, iust as I doe now,
703    He would Kisse you Twenty with a breath.
704    <S {Cham}.> Well said my Lord:
705    So now y'are fairely seated: Gentlemen,
706    The pennance lyes on you; if these faire Ladies
707    Passe away frowning.
708    <S {San}.> For my little Cure,
709    Let me alone.
710    <D {Hoboyes. Enter Cardinall Wolsey, and takes his State}.>
711   *<S {Card}.> Y'are welcome my faire Guests; that noble Lady
712    Or Gentleman that is not freely merry
713    Is not my Friend. This to confirme my welcome,
714    And to you all good health.
715    <S {San}.> Your Grace is Noble,
716    Let me haue such a Bowle may hold my thankes,
717    And saue me so much talking.
718    <S {Card}.> My Lord {Sands},
      <P t6>
719    I am beholding to you: cheere your neighbours:
720    Ladies you are not merry; Gentlemen,
721    Whose fault is this?
722    <S {San}.> The red wine first must rise
723   *In their faire cheekes my Lord, then wee shall haue 'em,
724    Talke vs to silence.
725    <S {An.B}.> You are a merry Gamster
726    My Lord {Sands}.
727    <S {San}.> Yes, if I make my play:
728    Heer's to your Ladiship, and pledge it Madam:
729    For tis to such a thing.
730    <S {An.B}.> You cannot shew me.
731    <D {Drum and Trumpet, Chambers dischargd}.>
732    <S {San}.> I told your Grace, they would talke anon.
733    <S {Card}.> What's that?
734    <S {Cham}.> Looke out there, some of ye.
735    <S {Card}.> What warlike voyce,
736    And to what end is this? Nay, Ladies, feare not;
737    By all the lawes of Warre y'are priuiledg'd.
738    <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
739    <S {Cham}.> How now, what is't?
740    <S {Seru}.> A noble troupe of Strangers,
741    For so they seeme; th' haue left their Barge and landed,
742    And hither make, as great Embassadors
743    From forraigne Princes.
744    <S {Card}.> Good Lord Chamberlaine,
745   *Go, giue 'em welcome; you can speake the French tongue
746    And pray receiue 'em Nobly, and conduct 'em
747    Into our presence, where this heauen of beauty
748    Shall shine at full vpon them. Some attend him.
749    <D {All rise, and Tables remou'd}.>
750    You haue now a broken Banket, but wee'l mend it.
751    A good digestion to you all; and once more
752    I showre a welcome on yee: welcome all.
753   *<D {Hoboyes. Enter King and others as Maskers, habited like}

756    {him}.>
757    A noble Company: what are their pleasures?
758   *<S {Cham}.> Because they speak no English, thus they praid
759    To tell your Grace: That hauing heard by fame
760    Of this so Noble and so faire assembly,
761    This night to meet heere they could doe no lesse,
762    (Out of the great respect they beare to beauty)
763    But leaue their Flockes, and vnder your faire Conduct
764    Craue leaue to view these Ladies, and entreat
765    An houre of Reuels with 'em.
766    <S {Card}.> Say, Lord {Chamberlaine},
767    They haue done my poore house grace:
768    For which I pay 'em a thousand thankes,
769    And pray 'em take their pleasures.
770    <D {Choose Ladies, King and #An Bullen}.>
771    <S {King}.> The fairest hand I euer touch'd: O Beauty,
772    Till now I neuer knew thee.
773    <D {Musicke, Dance}.>
774    <S {Card}.> My Lord.
775    <S {Cham}.> Your Grace.
776    <S {Card}.> Pray tell 'em thus much from me:
777    There should be one amongst 'em by his person
778    More worthy this place then my selfe, to whom
779    (If I but knew him) with my loue and duty
780    I would surrender it.  <D {Whisper}.>
781    <S {Cham}.> I will my Lord.
782    <S {Card}.> What say they?
783    <S {Cham}.> Such a one, they all confesse
784    There is indeed, which they would haue your Grace
785    Find out, and he will take it.
786    <S {Card}.> Let me see then,
787    By all your good leaues Gentlemen; heere Ile make
788    My royall choyce.
789    <S {Kin}.> Ye haue found him Cardinall,
790    You hold a faire Assembly; you doe well Lord:
791    You are a Churchman, or Ile tell you Cardinall,
792    I should iudge now vnhappily.
793    <S {Card}.> I am glad
794    Your Grace is growne so pleasant.
795    <S {Kin}.> My Lord Chamberlaine,
796    Prethee come hither, what faire Ladie's that?
797    <S {Cham}.> An't please your Grace,
798    Sir {Thomas Bullens} Daughter, the Viscount {Rochford},
799    One of her Highnesse women.
800    <S {Kin}.> By Heauen she is a dainty one. Sweet heart,
801    I were vnmannerly to take you out,
802    And not to kisse you. A health Gentlemen,
803    Let it goe round.
804    <S {Card}.> Sir {Thomas Louell}, is the Banket ready
805    I'th' Priuy Chamber?
806    <S {Lou}.> Yes, my Lord.
807    <S {Card}.> Your Grace
808    I feare, with dancing is a little heated.
809    <S {Kin}.> I feare too much.
810    <S {Card}.> There's fresher ayre my Lord,
811    In the next Chamber.
812   *<S {Kin}.> Lead in your Ladies eu'ry one: Sweet Partner,
813    I must not yet forsake you: Let's be merry,
814   *Good my Lord Cardinall: I haue halfe a dozen healths,
815    To drinke to these faire Ladies, and a measure
816    To lead 'em once againe, and then let's dreame
817    Who's best in fauour. Let the Musicke knock it.
818    <D {Exeunt with Trumpets}.>
      <A A>
819    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
820    <D {Enter two Gentlemen at seuerall Doores}.>
821    <S 1.> Whether away so fast?
822    <S 2.> O, God saue ye:
823    Eu'n to the Hall, to heare what shall become
824    Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
825    <S 1.> Ile saue you
826    That labour Sir. All's now done but the Ceremony
827    Of bringing backe the Prisoner.
828    <S 2.> Were you there ?
829    <S 1.> Yes indeed was I.
830    <S 2.> Pray speake what ha's happen'd.
831    <S 1.> You may guesse quickly what.
832    <S 2.> Is he found guilty?
833    <S 1.> Yes truely is he,
834    And condemn'd vpon't.
835    <S 2.> I am sorry fort.
836    <S 1.> So are a number more.
837    <S 2.> But pray how past it?
838    <S 1.> Ile tell you in a little. The great Duke
839    Came to the Bar; where, to his accusations
840    He pleaded still not guilty, and alleadged
841    Many sharpe reasons to defeat the Law.
842    The Kings Atturney on the contrary,
843    Vrg'd on the Examinations, proofes, confessions
      <P t6v>
844    Of diuers witnesses, which the Duke desir'd
845    To him brought {viua voce} to his face;
846    At which appear'd against him, his Surueyor
847    Sir {Gilbert Pecke} his Chancellour, and {Iohn Car},
848    Confessor to him, with that Diuell Monke,
849    {Hopkins}, that made this mischiefe.
850    <S 2.> That was hee
851    That fed him with his Prophecies.
852    <S 1.> The same,
853    All these accus'd him strongly, which he faine
854    Would haue flung from him; but indeed he could not;
855    And so his Peeres vpon this euidence,
856    Haue found him guilty of high Treason. Much
857    He spoke, and learnedly for life: But all
858    Was either pittied in him, or forgotten.
859    <S 2.> After all this, how did he beare himselfe?
860    <S 1.> When he was brought agen to th' Bar, to heare
861    His Knell rung out, his Iudgement, he was stir'd
862    With such an Agony, he sweat extreamly,
863    And somthing spoke in choller, #ill, and hasty:
864    But he fell to himselfe againe, and sweetly,
865    In all the rest shew'd a most Noble patience.
866    <S 2.> I doe not thinke he feares death.
867    <S 1.> Sure he does not,
868    He neuer was so womanish, the cause
869    He may a little grieue at.
870    <S 2.> Certainly,
871    The Cardinall is the end of this.
872    <S 1.> Tis likely,
873    By all coniectures: First {Kildares} Attendure;
874    Then Deputy of Ireland, who remou'd
875    Earle {Surrey}, was sent thither, and in #hast too,
876    Least he should helpe his Father.
877    <S 2.> That tricke of State
878    Was a deepe enuious one,
879    <S 1.> At his returne,
880    No doubt he will requite it; this is noted
881    (And generally) who euer the King fauours,
882    The Cardnall instantly will finde imployment,
883    And farre enough from Court too.
884    <S 2.> All the Commons
885    Hate him perniciously, and #o' my Conscience
886    Wish him ten faddom deepe: This Duke as much
887   *They loue and doate on: call him bounteous {Buckingham},
888    The Mirror of all courtesie.
889   *<D {Enter Buckingham from his Arraignment, Tipstaues before}
890   *{him, the Axe with the edge towards him, Halberds on each}
891   *{side, accompanied with Sir Thomas Louell, Sir Nicholas}
892    {#Vaux, Sir Walter Sands, and common people, &c}.>
893    <S 1.> Stay there Sir,
894    And see the noble ruin'd man you speake of.
895    <S 2.> Let's stand close and behold him.
896    <S {Buck}.> All good people,
897    You that thus farre haue come to pitty me;
898    Heare what I say, and then goe home and lose me.
899    I haue this day receiu'd a Traitors iudgement,
900    And by that name must dye; yet Heauen beare witnes,
901    #And if I haue a Conscience, let it sincke me,
902    Euen as the Axe falls, if I be not faithfull.
903    The Law I beare no mallice for my death,
904    T'has done vpon the premises, but Iustice:
905    But those that sought it, I could wish more Christians:
906    (Be what they will) I heartily forgiue 'em;
907    Yet let 'em looke they glory not in mischiefe;
908    Nor build their euils on the graues of great men;
909    For then, my guiltlesse blood must cry against 'em.
910    For further life in this world I ne're hope,
911    Nor will I sue, although the King haue mercies
912    More then I dare make faults.
913    You few that lou'd me,
914    And dare be bold to weepe for {Buckingham},
915    His Noble Friends and Fellowes; whom to leaue
916    Is only bitter to him, only dying:
917    Goe with me like good Angels to my end,
918    And as the long diuorce of Steele fals on me,
919    Make of your Prayers one sweet Sacrifice,
920    And lift my Soule to Heauen.
921    Lead on #a Gods name.
922    <S {Louell}.> I doe beseech your Grace, for charity
923    If euer any malice in your heart
924    Were hid against me, now to forgiue me frankly.
925    <S {Buck}.> Sir {Thomas Louell}, I as free forgiue you
926    As I would be forgiuen: I forgiue all.
927    There cannot be those numberlesse offences
928    Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:
929    No blacke Enuy shall make my Graue.
930    Commend mee to his Grace:
931    And if he speake of {Buckingham}; pray tell him,
932    You met him halfe in Heauen: my vowes and prayers
933    Yet are the Kings; and till my Soule forsake,
934    Shall cry for blessings on him. May he liue
935    Longer then I haue time to tell his yeares;
936    Euer belou'd and louing, may his Rule be;
937    And when old Time shall lead him to his end,
938    Goodnesse and he, fill vp one Monument.
939    <S {Lou}.> To th' water side I must conduct your Grace;
940    Then giue my Charge vp to Sir {Nicholas Vaux},
941    Who vndertakes you to your end.
942    <S {Vaux}.> Prepare there,
943    The Duke is comming: See the Barge be ready;
944    And fit it with such furniture as suites
945    The Greatnesse of his Person.
946    <S {Buck}.> Nay, Sir {Nicholas},
947    Let it alone; my State now will but mocke me.
948    When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable,
949    And Duke of {Buckingham}: now, poore {Edward Bohun};
950    Yet I am richer then my base Accusers,
951    That neuer knew what Truth meant: I now seale it;
952   *And with that bloud will make 'em one day groane for't.
953    My noble Father {Henry} of {Buckingham},
954    Who first rais'd head against Vsurping {Richard},
955    Flying for succour to his Seruant {Banister},
956    Being distrest; was by that wretch betraid,
957    And without Tryall, fell; Gods peace be with him.
958    {Henry} the Seauenth succeeding, truly pittying
959    My Fathers losse; like a most Royall Prince
960    Restor'd me to my Honours: and out of ruines
961    Made my Name once more Noble. Now his Sonne,
962    {Henry} the Eight, Life, Honour, Name and all
963    That made me happy; at one stroake ha's taken
964    For euer from the World. I had my Tryall,
965    And must needs say a Noble one; which makes me
966    A little happier then my wretched Father:
967    Yet thus farre we are one in Fortunes; both
968    Fell by our Seruants, by those Men we lou'd most:
969    A most vnnaturall and faithlesse Seruice.
970    Heauen ha's an end in all: yet, you that heare me,
971    This from a dying man receiue as certaine:
972    Where you are liberall of your loues and Councels,
973    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends,
      <P v1>
974    And giue your hearts to; when they once perceiue
975    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
976    Like water from ye, neuer found againe
977    But where they meane to sinke ye: all good people
978    Pray for me, I must now forsake ye; the last houre
979    Of my long weary life is come vpon me:
980   *Farewell; and when you would say somthing that is sad,
981    Speake how I fell.
982    I haue done; and God forgiue me.
983    <D {Exeunt Duke and Traine}.>
984    <S 1.> O, this is full of pitty; Sir, it cals
985    I feare, too many curses on their heads
986    That were the Authors.
987    <S 2.> If the Duke be guiltlesse,
988    'Tis full of woe: yet I can giue you inckling
989    Of an ensuing euill, if it fall,
990    Greater then this.
991    <S 1.> Good Angels keepe it from vs:
992    What may it be? you doe not doubt my faith Sir?
993    <S 2.> This Secret is so weighty, 'twill require
994    A strong faith to conceale it.
995    <S 1.> Let me haue it:
996    I doe not talke much.
997    <S 2.> I am confident;
998    You shall Sir: Did you not of late dayes heare
999    A buzzing of a Separation
1000   Betweene the King and {Katherine}?
1001   <S 1.> Yes, but it held not;
1002   For when the King once heard it, out of anger
1003   He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
1004   To stop the rumor; and allay those tongues
1005   That durst disperse it.
1006   <S 2.> But that slander Sir,
1007   Is found a truth now: for it growes agen
1008   Fresher then e're it was; and held for certaine
1009   The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinall,
1010   Or some about him neere, haue out of malice
1011   To the good Queene, possest him with a scruple
1012   That will vndoe her: To confirme this too,
1013   Cardinall {Campeius} is arriu'd, and lately,
1014   As all thinke for this busines.
1015   <S 1.> Tis the Cardinall;
1016   And meerely to reuenge him on the Emperour,
1017   For not bestowing on him at his asking,
1018   The Archbishopricke of {Toledo}, this is purpos'd.
1019   <S 2.> I thinke
1020   You haue hit the marke; but is't not cruell,
1021   That she should feele the smart of this: the Cardinall
1022   Will haue his #will, and she must fall.
1023   <S 1.> 'Tis wofull.
1024   Wee are too open heere to argue this:
1025   Let's thinke in priuate more.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A B>
1026   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1027   <D {Enter Lord Chamberlaine, reading this Letter}.>
1028  *{My Lord, the  Horses your Lordship sent for, with all the}
1029  *{care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish'd}.
1030  *{They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the}
1031  *{North. When they were ready to set out for London, a man}
1032  *{of my Lord Cardinalls, by Commission, and maine power tooke}
1033  *{'em from me, with this reason: his maister would bee seru'd be-fore}
1034  *{a Subiect, if not before the King, which stop'd our mouthes}
1035   {Sir}.
1036  *I feare he will indeede; well, let him haue them; hee
1037   will haue all I thinke.
1038   <D {Enter to the Lord Chamberlaine, the Dukes of Nor-folke}
1039   {and Suffolke}.>
1040   <S {Norf}.> Well met my Lord {Chamberlaine}.
1041   <S {Cham}.> Good day to both your Graces.
1042   <S {Suff}.> How is the King imployd?
1043   <S {Cham}.> I left him priuate,
1044   Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
1045   <S {Norf}.> What's the cause?
1046  *<S {Cham}.> It seemes the Marriage with his Brothers Wife
1047   Ha's crept too neere his Conscience.
1048   <S {Suff}.> No, his Conscience
1049   Ha's crept too neere another Ladie.
1050   <S {Norf}.> Tis so;
1051   This is the Cardinals doing: The King- Cardinall,
1052   That blinde Priest, like the eldest Sonne of Fortune,
1053  *Turnes what he list. The King will know him one day.
1054   <S {Suff}.> Pray God he doe,
1055   Hee'l neuer know himselfe else.
1056   <S {Norf}.> How holily he workes in all his businesse,
1057  *And with what zeale? For now he has crackt the League
1058  *Between vs & the Emperor (the Queens great Nephew)
1059   He diues into the Kings Soule, and there scatters
1060   Dangers, doubts, wringing of the Conscience,
1061   Feares, and despaires, and all these for his Marriage.
1062   And out of all these, to restore the King,
1063   He counsels a Diuorce, a losse of her
1064   That like a Iewell, ha's hung twenty yeares
1065   About his necke, yet neuer lost her lustre;
1066   Of her that loues him with that excellence,
1067   That Angels loue good men with: Euen of her,
1068   That when the greatest stroake of Fortune falls
1069   Will blesse the King: and is not this course pious?
1070  *<S {Cham}.> Heauen keep me from such councel: tis most true
1071   These newes are euery where, euery tongue speaks 'em,
1072   And euery true heart weepes for't. All that dare
1073   Looke into these affaires, see this maine end,
1074   The French Kings Sister. Heauen will one day open
1075   The Kings eyes, that so long haue slept vpon
1076   This bold bad man.
1077   <S {Suff}.> And free vs from his slauery.
1078   <S {Norf}.> We had need pray,
1079   And heartily, for our deliuerance;
1080   Or this imperious man will worke vs all
1081   From Princes into Pages: all mens honours
1082   Lie like one lumpe before him, to be fashion'd
1083   Into what pitch he please.
1084   <S {Suff}.> For me, my Lords,
1085   I loue him not, nor feare him, there's my Creede:
1086   As I am made without him, so Ile stand,
1087   If the King please: his Curses and his blessings
1088   Touch me alike: th'are breath I not beleeue in.
1089   I knew him, and I know him: so I leaue him
1090   To him that made him proud; the Pope.
1091   <S {Norf}.> Let's in;
1092   And with some other busines, put the King
1093  *From these sad thoughts, that work too much vpon him:
1094   My Lord, youle beare vs company?
1095   <S {Cham}.> Excuse me,
1096   The King ha's sent me otherwhere: Besides
1097   You'l finde a most vnfit time to disturbe him:
1098   Health to your Lordships.
      <P v1v>
1099   <S {Norfolke}.> Thankes my good Lord {Chamberlaine}.
1100  *<D {Exit Lord Chamberlaine, and the King drawes the Curtaine}
1101   {and sits reading pensiuely}.>
1102   <S {Suff}.> How sad he lookes; sure he is much afflicted.
1103  *<S {Kin}.> Who's there? Ha?
1104   <S {Norff}.> Pray God he be not angry.
1105   <S {Kin}.> Who's there I say? How dare you thrust your |(selues
1106   Into my priuate Meditations?
1107   Who am I? Ha?
1108   <S {Norff}.> A gracious King, that pardons all offences
1109   Malice ne're meant: Our breach of Duty this way,
1110   Is businesse of Estate; in which, we come
1111   To know your Royall pleasure.
1112   <S {Kin}.> Ye are too bold:
1113   Go too; Ile make ye know your times of businesse:
1114   Is this an howre for temporall affaires? Ha?
1115   <D {Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a Commission}.>
1116   Who's there? my good Lord Cardinall? O my {Wolsey},
1117   The quiet of my wounded Conscience;
1118   Thou art a cure fit for a King; #you'r welcome
1119   Most learned Reuerend Sir, into our Kingdome,
1120   Vse vs, and it: My good Lord, haue great care,
1121   I be not found a Talker.
1122   <S {Wol}.> Sir, you cannot;
1123   I would your Grace would giue vs but an houre
1124   Of priuate conference.
1125   <S {Kin}.> We are busie; goe.
1126   <S {Norff}.> This Priest ha's no pride in him?
1127   <S {Suff}.> Not to speake of:
1128   I would not be so sicke though for his place:
1129   But this cannot continue.
1130   <S {Norff}.> If it doe, Ile venture one; haue at him.
1131   <S {Suff}.> I another.
1132   <D {Exeunt Norfolke and Suffolke}.>
1133   <S {Wol}.> Your Grace ha's giuen a President of wisedome
1134   Aboue all Princes, in committing freely
1135   Your scruple to the voyce of Christendome:
1136   Who can be angry now? What Enuy reach you?
1137   The Spaniard tide by blood and fauour to her,
1138   Must now confesse, if they haue any goodnesse,
1139   The Tryall, iust and Noble. All the Clerkes,
1140   (I meane the learned ones in Christian Kingdomes)
1141  *Haue their free voyces. Rome  (the Nurse of Iudgement)
1142   Inuited by your Noble selfe, hath sent
1143   One generall Tongue vnto vs. This good man,
1144   This iust and learned Priest, Cardnall {Campeius},
1145   Whom once more, I present vnto your Highnesse.
1146  *<S {Kin}.> And once more in mine armes I bid him welcome,
1147   And thanke the holy Conclaue for their loues,
1148  *They haue sent me such a Man, I would haue wish'd for.
1149  *<S {Cam}.> Your Grace must needs deserue all strangers loues,
1150   You are so Noble: To your Highnesse hand
1151   I tender my Commission; by whose vertue,
1152   The Court of Rome commanding. You my Lord
1153   Cardinall of {Yorke}, are ioyn'd with me their Seruant,
1154   In the vnpartiall iudging of this Businesse.
1155  *<S {Kin}.> Two equall men: The Queene shall be acquain-|(ted
1156   Forthwith for what you come. Where's {Gardiner}?
1157   <S {Wol}.> I know your Maiesty, ha's alwayes lou'd her
1158   So deare in heart, not to deny her that
1159   A Woman of lesse Place might aske by Law;
1160   Schollers allow'd freely to argue for her.
1161   <S {Kin}.> #I, and the best she shall haue; and my fauour
1162   To him that does best, God forbid els: Cardinall,
1163   Prethee call {Gardiner} to me, my new Secretary.
1164   I find him a fit fellow.
1165   <D {Enter Gardiner}.>
1166  *<S {Wol}.> Giue me your hand: much ioy & fauour to you;
1167   You are the Kings now.
1168   <S {Gard}.> But to be commanded
1169   For euer by your Grace, whose hand ha's rais'd me.
1170   <S {Kin}.> Come hither {Gardiner}.
1171   <D {Walkes and whispers}.>
1172  *<S {Camp}.> My Lord of {Yorke}, was not one Doctor {Pace}
1173   In this mans place before him?
1174   <S {Wol}.> Yes, he was.
1175   <S {Camp}.> Was he not held a learned man?
1176   <S {Wol}.> Yes surely.
1177  *<S {Camp}.> Beleeue me, there's an #ill opinion spread then,
1178   Euen of your selfe Lord Cardinall.
1179   <S {Wol}.> How? of me?
1180   <S {Camp}.> They will not sticke to say, you enuide him;
1181   And fearing he would rise (he was so vertuous)
1182   Kept him a forraigne man still, which so greeu'd him,
1183   That he ran mad, and dide.
1184   <S {Wol}.> Heau'ns peace be with him:
1185   That's Christian care enough: for liuing Murmurers,
1186   There's places of rebuke. He was a Foole;
1187   For he would needs be vertuous. That good Fellow,
1188   If I command him followes my appointment,
1189   I will haue none so neere els. Learne this Brother,
1190   We liue not to be grip'd by meaner persons.
1191   <S {Kin}.> Deliuer this with modesty to th' Queene.
1192   <D {Exit Gardiner}.>
1193   The most conuenient place, that I can thinke of
1194   For such receipt of Learning, is Black- Fryers:
1195   There ye shall meete about this waighty busines.
1196   My {Wolsey}, see it furnish'd, O my Lord,
1197   Would it not grieue an able man to leaue
1198   So sweet a Bedfellow? But Conscience, Conscience;
1199   O 'tis a tender place, and I must leaue her.  <D {Exeunt}.>

1202  *<S {An}.> Not for that neither; here's the pang that pinches.
1203   His Highnesse, hauing liu'd so long with her, and she
1204   So good a Lady, that no Tongue could euer
1205   Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
1206   She neuer knew harme- doing: Oh, now after
1207   So many courses of the Sun enthroaned,
1208   Still growing in a Maiesty and pompe, the which
1209   To leaue, a thousand fold more bitter, then
1210   'Tis sweet at first t' acquire. After this Processe.
1211   To giue her the auaunt, it is a pitty
1212   Would moue a Monster.
1213   <S {Old} {La}.> Hearts of most hard temper
1214   Melt and lament for her.
1215   <S {An}.> Oh Gods #will, much better
1216   She ne're had knowne pompe; though't be temporall,
1217   Yet if that quarrell. Fortune, do diuorce
1218   It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance, panging
1219   As soule and bodies seuering.
1220   <S {Old} {L}.> Alas poore Lady,
1221   Shee's a stranger now againe.
1222   <S {An}.> So much the more
1223   Must pitty drop vpon her; verily
1224   I sweare, tis better to be lowly borne,
      <P v2>
1225   And range with humble liuers in Content,
1226   Then to be perk'd vp in a glistring griefe,
1227   And weare a golden sorrow.
1228   <S {Old} {L}.> Our content
1229   Is our best #hauing.
1230   <S {Anne}.> By my troth, and Maidenhead,
1231   I would not be a Queene.
1232   <S {Old.L}.> Beshrew me, I would,
1233   And venture Maidenhead for't, and so would you
1234   For all this spice of your Hipocrisie:
1235   You that haue so faire parts of Woman on you,
1236   Haue (too) a Womans heart, which euer yet
1237   Affected Eminence, Wealth, Soueraignty;
1238   Which, to say sooth, are Blessings; and which guifts
1239   (Sauing your mincing) the capacity
1240   Of your soft Chiuerell Conscience, would receiue,
1241   If you might please to stretch it.
1242   <S {Anne}.> Nay, good troth.
1243  *<S {Old} {L}.> Yes troth, & troth; you would not be a Queen?
1244   <S {Anne}.> No, not for all the riches vnder Heauen.
1245  *<S {Old.L}.> Tis strange; a threepence bow'd would hire me
1246   Old as I am, to Queene it: but I pray you,
1247   What thinke you of a Dutchesse? Haue you limbs
1248   To beare that load of Title?
1249   <S {An}.> No in truth.
1250  *<S {Old.L}.> Then you are weakly made; plucke off a little,
1251   I would not be a young Count in your way,
1252   For more then blushing comes to: If your backe
1253   Cannot vouchsafe this burthen, tis too weake
1254   Euer to get a Boy.
1255   <S {An}.> How you doe talke;
1256   I sweare againe, I would not be a Queene,
1257   For all the world.
1258   <S {Old.L}.> In faith, for little England
1259   You'ld venture an emballing: I my selfe
1260   Would for {Carnaruanshire}, although there long'd
1261  *No more to th' Crowne but that: Lo, who comes here?
1262   <D {Enter Lord Chamberlaine}.>
1263  *<S {L.Cham}.> Good morrow Ladies; what wer't worth to |(know
1264   The secret of your conference?
1265   <S {An}.> My good Lord,
1266   Not your demand; it values not your asking:
1267   Our Mistris Sorrowes we were pittying.
1268   <S {Cham}.> It was a gentle businesse, and becomming
1269   The action of good women, there is hope
1270   All will be well.
1271   <S {An}.> Now I pray God, {Amen}.
1272  *<S {Cham}.> You beare a gentle minde, & heau'nly blessings
1273   Follow such Creatures. That you may, faire Lady
1274   Perceiue I speake sincerely, and high notes
1275   Tane of your many vertues; the Kings Maiesty
1276   Commends his good opinion of you, to you; and
1277   Doe's purpose honour to you no lesse flowing,
1278   Then Marchionesse of {Pembrooke}; to which Title,
1279   A Thousand pound a yeare, Annuall support,
1280   Out of his Grace, he addes.
1281   <S {An}.> I doe not know
1282   What kinde of my obedience, I should tender;
1283   More then my All, is Nothing: Nor my Prayers
1284   Are not words duely hallowed; nor my Wishes
1285  *More worth, then empty vanities: yet Prayers & Wishes
1286   Are all I can returne. 'Beseech your Lordship,
1287   Vouchsafe to speake my thankes, and my obedience,
1288   As from a blushing Handmaid, to his Highnesse;
1289   Whose health and Royalty I pray for.
1290   <S {Cham}.> Lady;
1291   I shall not faile t' approue the faire conceit
1292   The King hath of you. I haue perus'd her well,
1293   Beauty and Honour in her are so mingled,
1294  *That they haue caught the King: and who knowes yet
1295   But from this Lady, may proceed a Iemme,
1296   To lighten all this #Ile. I'le to the King,
1297   And say I spoke with you.
1298   <D {Exit Lord Chamberlaine}.>
1299   <S {An}.> My honour'd Lord.
1300   <S {Old.L}.> Why this it is: See, see,
1301   I haue beene begging sixteene yeares in Court
1302   (Am yet a Courtier beggerly) nor could
1303   Come pat betwixt too early, and too late
1304   For any suit of pounds: and you, (oh fate)
1305   A very fresh Fish heere; fye, fye, fye vpon
1306   This compel'd fortune: haue your mouth fild vp,
1307   Before you open it.
1308   <S {An}.> This is strange to me.
1309   <S {Old} {L}.> How tasts it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no:
1310   There was a Lady once (tis an old Story)
1311   That would not be a Queene, that would she not
1312   For all the mud in Egypt; haue you heard it?
1313   <S {An}.> Come you are pleasant.
1314   <S {Old.L}.> With your Theame, I could
1315  *O're- mount the Larke: The Marchionesse of {Pembrooke}?
1316   A thousand pounds a yeare, for pure respect?
1317   No other obligation? by my Life,
1318   That promises mo thousands: Honours traine
1319   Is longer then his fore- skirt; by this time
1320   I know your backe will beare a Dutchesse. Say,
1321   Are you not stronger then you were?
1322   <S {An}.> Good Lady,
1323   Make your selfe mirth with your particular fancy,
1324   And leaue me out on't. Would I had no being
1325   If this salute my blood a iot; it faints me
1326   To thinke what followes.
1327   The Queene is comfortlesse, and wee forgetfull
1328   In our long absence: pray doe not deliuer,
1329   What heere y'haue heard to her.

1366   Sir, I desire you do me Right and Iustice,
1367   And to bestow your pitty on me; for
1368   I am a most poore Woman, and a Stranger,
1369   Borne out of your Dominions: hauing heere
1370   No Iudge indifferent, nor no more assurance
1371   Of equall Friendship and Proceeding. Alas Sir:
1372   In what haue I offended you? What cause
1373   Hath my behauiour giuen to your displeasure,
1374   That thus you should proceede to put me off,
1375   And take your good Grace from me? Heauen witnesse,
1376   I haue bene to you, a true and humble Wife,
1377   At all times to your #will conformable:
1378   Euer in feare to kindle your Dislike,
1379   Yea, subiect to your Countenance: Glad, or sorry,
1380   As I saw it inclin'd? When was the houre
1381   I euer contradicted your Desire?
1382   Or made it not mine too? Or which of your Friends
1383   Haue I not stroue to loue, although I knew
1384   He were mine Enemy? What Friend of mine,
1385   That had to him deriu'd your Anger, did I
1386   Continue in my Liking? Nay, gaue notice
1387   He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, call to minde,
1388   That I haue beene your Wife, in this Obedience,
1389   Vpward of twenty years, and haue bene blest
1390   With many Children by you. If in the course
1391   And processe of this time, you can report,
1392   And proue it too, against mine Honor, aught;
1393   My bond to Wedlocke, or my Loue and Dutie
1394   Against your Sacred Person; in Gods name
1395   Turne me away: and let the fowl'st Contempt
1396   Shut doore vpon me, and so giue me vp
1397   To the sharp'st kinde of Iustice. Please you, Sir,
1398   The King your Father, was reputed for
1399   A Prince most Prudent; of an excellent
1400   And vnmatch'd Wit, and Iudgement. {Ferdinand}
1401   My Father, King of Spaine, was reckon'd one
1402   The wisest Prince, that there had reign'd, by many
1403   A yeare before. It is not to be question'd,
1404   That they had gather'd a wise Councell to them
1405   Of euery Realme, that did debate this Businesse,
1406  *Who deem'd our Marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly
1407   Beseech you Sir, to spare me, till I may
1408   Be by my Friends in Spaine, aduis'd; whose Counsaile
1409   I will implore. If not, i'th' name of God
1410   Your pleasure be fulfill'd.
1411   <S {Wol}.> You haue heere Lady,
1412   (And of your choice) these Reuerend Fathers, men
1413   Of singular Integrity, and Learning;
1414   Yea, the elect o'th' Land, who are assembled
1415   To pleade your Cause. It shall be therefore bootlesse,
1416   That longer you desire the Court, as well
1417   For your owne quiet, as to rectifie
1418   What is vnsetled in the King.
1419   <S {Camp}.> His Grace
1420   Hath spoken well, and iustly: Therefore Madam,
1421   It's fit this Royall Session do proceed,
1422   And that (without delay) their Arguments
1423   Be now produc'd, and heard.
1424   <S {Qu}.> Lord Cardinall, to you I speake.
1425   <S {Wol}.> Your pleasure, Madam.
1426   <S {Qu}.> Sir, I am about to weepe; but thinking that
1427   We are a Queene (or long haue dream'd so) certaine
1428   The daughter of a King, my drops of teares,
1429   Ile turne to sparkes of fire.
1430   <S {Wol}.> Be patient yet.
1431   <S {Qu}.> I will, when you are humble; Nay before,
1432   Or God will punish me. I do beleeue
1433   (Induc'd by potent Circumstances) that
1434   You are mine Enemy, and make my Challenge,
1435   You shall not be my Iudge. For it is you
1436   Haue blowne this Coale, betwixt my Lord, and me;
1437   (Which Gods dew quench) therefore, I say againe,
1438   I vtterly abhorre; yea, from my Soule
1439   Refuse you for my Iudge, whom yet once more
1440   I hold my most malicious Foe, and thinke not
1441   At all a Friend to truth.
1442   <S {Wol}.> I do professe
1443   You speake not like your selfe: who euer yet
1444   Haue stood to Charity, and displayd th' effects
1445   Of disposition gentle, and of wisedome,
1446  *Ore- topping womans powre. Madam, you do me wrong
1447   I haue no Spleene against you, nor iniustice
1448   For you, or any: how farre I haue proceeded,
1449   Or how farre further (Shall) is warranted
1450   By a Commission from the Consistorie,
1451   Yea, the whole Consistorie of Rome. You charge me,
1452   That I haue blowne this Coale: I do deny it,
1453   The King is present: If it be knowne to him,
1454   That I gainsay my Deed, how may he wound,
1455   And worthily my Falsehood, yea, as much
1456   As you haue done my Truth. If he know
1457   That I am free of your Report, he knowes
1458   I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
1459   It lies to cure me, and the Cure is to
1460   Remoue these Thoughts from you. The which before
1461   His Highnesse shall speake in, I do beseech
1462   You (gracious Madam) to vnthinke your speaking,
1463   And to say so no more.
1464   <S {Queen}.> My Lord, My Lord,
1465   I am a simple woman, much too weake
1466  *T' oppose your cunning. Y'are meek, & humble- mouth'd
1467   You signe your Place, and Calling, in full seeming,
1468   With Meekenesse and Humilitie: but your Heart
1469   Is cramm'd with Arrogancie, Spleene, and Pride.
1470   You haue by Fortune, and his Highnesse fauors,
1471   Gone slightly o're lowe steppes, and now are mounted
1472   Where Powres are your Retainers, and your words
1473   (Domestickes to you) serue your #will, as't please
1474   Your selfe pronounce their Office. I must tell you,
1475   You tender more your persons Honor, then
1476   Your high profession Spirituall. That agen
1477   I do refuse you for my Iudge, and heere
1478   Before you all, Appeale vnto the Pope,
1479   To bring my whole Cause 'fore his Holinesse,
1480   And to be iudg'd by him.
1481   <D {She Curtsies to the King, and offers to depart}.>
      <P v3><C I>
1482   <S {Camp}.> The Queene is obstinate,
1483   Stubborne to Iustice, apt to accuse it, and
1484   Disdainfull to be tride by't; tis not well.
1485   Shee's going away.
1486   <S {Kin}.> Call her againe.
1487  *<S {Crier}.> {Katherine}. Q[ueene]. of England, come into the Court.
1488   <S {Gent.Vsh}.> Madam, you are cald backe.
1489  *<S {Que}.> What need you note it? pray you keep your way,
1490   When you are cald returne. Now the Lord helpe,
1491   They vexe me past my patience, pray you passe on;
1492   I will not tarry: no, nor euer more
1493   Vpon this businesse my appearance make,
1494   In any of their Courts.
1495   <D {Exit Queene, and her Attendants}.>
1496   <S {Kin}.> Goe thy wayes {Kate},
1497   That man i'th' world, who shall report he ha's
1498   A better Wife, let him in naught be trusted,
1499   For speaking false in that; thou art alone
1500   (If thy rare qualities, sweet gentlenesse,
1501   Thy meeknesse Saint- like, Wife- like Gouernment,
1502   Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
1503   Soueraigne and Pious els, could speake thee out)
1504  *The Queene of earthly Queenes: Shee's Noble borne;
1505   And like her true Nobility, she ha's
1506   Carried her selfe towards me.
1507   <S {Wol}.> Most gracious Sir,
1508   In humblest manner I require your Highnes,
1509   That it shall please you to declare in hearing
1510   Of all these eares (for where I am rob'd and bound,
1511   There must I be vnloos'd, although not there
1512   At once, and fully satisfide) whether euer I
1513   Did broach this busines to your Highnes, or
1514   Laid any scruple in your way, which might
1515   Induce you to the question on't: or euer
1516   Haue to you, but with thankes to God for such
1517   A Royall Lady, spake one, the least word that might
1518   Be to the preiudice of her present State,
1519   Or touch of her good Person?
1520   <S {Kin}.> My Lord Cardinall,
1521   I doe excuse you; yea, vpon mine Honour,
1522   I free you from't: You are not to be taught
1523   That you haue many enemies, that know not
1524   Why they are so; but like to Village Curres,
1525   Barke when their fellowes doe. By some of these
1526   The Queene is put in anger; y'are excus'd:
1527   But will you be more iustifi'de? You euer
1528   Haue wish'd the sleeping of this busines, neuer desir'd
1529   It to be stir'd; but oft haue hindred, oft
1530   The passages made toward it; on my Honour,
1531   I speake my good Lord Cardnall, to this point;
1532   And thus farre cleare him.
1533   Now, what mou'd me too't,
1534   I will be bold with time and your attention:
1535  *Then marke th' inducement. Thus it came; giue heede |(too't:
1536   My Conscience first receiu'd a tendernes,
1537   Scruple, and pricke, on certaine Speeches vtter'd
1538   By th' Bishop of {Bayon}, then French Embassador,
1539   Who had beene hither sent on the debating
1540   And Marriage 'twixt the Duke of {Orleance}, and
1541   Our Daughter {Mary}: I'th' Progresse of this busines,
1542   Ere a determinate resolution, hee
1543   (I meane the Bishop) did require a respite,
1544   Wherein he might the King his Lord aduertise,
1545   Whether our Daughter were legitimate,
1546   Respecting this our Marriage with the Dowager,
1547   Sometimes our Brothers Wife. This respite shooke
1548   The bosome of my Conscience, enter'd me;
1549   Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble
1550   The region of my Breast, which forc'd such way,
1551   That many maz'd considerings, did throng
1552   And prest in with this Caution. First, me thought
1553   I stood not in the smile of Heauen, who had
1554   Commanded Nature, that my Ladies wombe
1555   If it conceiu'd a male- child by me, should
1556   Doe no more Offices of life too't; then
1557   The Graue does to th' dead: For her Male Issue,
1558   Or #di'de where they were made, or shortly after
1559   This world had ayr'd them. Hence I tooke a thought,
1560   This was a Iudgement on me, that my Kingdome
1561  *(Well worthy the best Heyre o'th' World) should not
1562   Be gladded in't by me. Then followes, that
1563   I weigh'd the danger which my Realmes stood in
1564   By this my Issues faile, and that gaue to me
1565   Many a groaning throw: thus hulling in
1566   The wild Sea of my Conscience, I did steere
1567   Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
1568   Now present heere together: that's to say,
1569   I meant to rectifie my Conscience, which
1570   I then did feele full sicke, and yet not well,
1571   By all the Reuerend Fathers of the Land,
1572   And Doctors learn'd. First I began in priuate,
1573   With you my Lord of {Lincolne}; you remember
1574   How vnder my oppression I did reeke
1575   When I first mou'd you.
1576   <S {B.Lin}.> Very well my Liedge.
1577   <S {Kin}.> I haue spoke long, be pleas'd your selfe to say
1578   How farre you satisfide me.
1579   <S {Lin}.> So please your Highnes,
1580   The question did at first so stagger me,
1581   Bearing a State of mighty moment in't,
1582   And consequence of dread, that I committed
1583   The daringst Counsaile which I had to doubt,
1584   And did entreate your Highnes to this course,
1585   Which you are running heere.
1586   <S {Kin}.> I then mou'd you,
1587   My Lord of {Canterbury}, and got your leaue
1588   To make this present Summons vnsolicited.
1589   I left no Reuerend Person in this Court;
1590   But by particular consent proceeded
1591   Vnder your hands and Seales; therefore goe on,
1592   For no dislike i'th' world against the person
1593   Of the good Queene; but the sharpe thorny points
1594   Of my alleadged reasons, driues this forward:
1595   Proue but our Marriage lawfull, by my Life
1596   And Kingly Dignity, we are contented
1597   To weare our mortall State to come, with her,
1598   ({Katherine} our Queene) before the primest Creature
1599   That's Parragon'd o'th' World.
1600   <S {Camp}.> So please your Highnes,
1601   The Queene being absent, 'tis a needfull fitnesse,
1602   That we adiourne this Court till further day;
1603   Meane while, must be an earnest motion
1604   Made to the Queene to call backe her Appeale
1605   She intends vnto his Holinesse.
1606   <S {Kin}.> I may perceiue
1607   These Cardinals trifle with me: I abhorre
1608   This dilatory sloth, and trickes of Rome.
1609   My learn'd and welbeloued Seruant {Cranmer},
1610   Prethee returne, with thy approch: I know,
1611   My comfort comes along: breake vp the Court;
1612   I say, set on.
1613   <D {Exeunt, in manner as they enter'd}.>
      <P v3v><A F>
1614   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1615   <D {Enter Queene and her Women as at worke}.>
1616   <S {Queen}.> Take thy Lute wench,
1617   My Soule growes sad with troubles,
1618   Sing, and disperse 'em if thou canst: leaue working.
1619   <D SONG.>
1620   {Orpheus with his Lute made Trees},
1621   {And the Mountaine tops that freeze},
1622   {Bow themselues when he did sing}.
1623   {To his Musicke, Plants and Flowers}
1624   {Euer sprung; as Sunne and Showers},
1625   {There had made a lasting Spring}.
1626   {Euery thing that heard him play},

1628   {Hung their heads, & then lay by}.
1629   {In sweet Musicke is such #Art},

1631   {Fall asleepe, or hearing dye}.
1632   <D {Enter a Gentleman}.>
1633   <S {Queen}.> How now?
1634  *<S {Gent}.> And't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals
1635   Wait in the presence.
1636   <S {Queen}.> Would they speake with me?
1637   <S {Gent}.> They wil'd me say so Madam.
1638   <S {Queen}.> Pray their Graces
1639   To come neere: what can be their busines
1640   With me, a poore weake woman, falne from fauour?
1641   I doe not like their comming; now I thinke on't,
1642   They should bee good men, their affaires as righteous:
1643   But all Hoods, make not Monkes.
1644   <D {Enter the two Cardinalls, Wolsey & Campian}.>
1645   <S {Wols}.> Peace to your Highnesse.
1646  *<S {Queen}.> Your Graces find me heere part of a Houswife,
1647   (I would be all) against the worst may happen:
1648   What are your pleasures with me, reuerent Lords?
1649   <S {Wol}.> May it please you Noble Madam, to withdraw
1650   Into your priuate Chamber; we shall giue you
1651   The full cause of our comming.
1652   <S {Queen}.> Speake it heere.
1653   There's nothing I haue done yet #o' my Conscience
1654   Deserues a Corner: would all other Women
1655   Could speake this with as free a Soule as I doe.
1656   My Lords, I care not (so much I am happy
1657   Aboue a number) if my actions
1658   Were tri'de by eu'ry tongue, eu'ry eye saw 'em,
1659   Enuy and base opinion set against 'em,
1660   I know my life so euen. If your busines
1661   Seeke me out, and that way I am Wife in;
1662   Out with it boldly: Truth loues open dealing.
1663  *<S {Card}.> {Tanta est erga te mentis integritas Regina serenissima}.
1664   <S {Queen}.> O good my Lord, no Latin;
1665   I am not such a Truant since my comming,
1666   As not to know the Language I haue liu'd in:
1667  *A strange Tongue makes my cause more strange, suspiti-|(ous:
1668  *Pray speake in English; heere are some will thanke you,
1669   If you speake truth, for their poore Mistris sake;
1670   Beleeue me she ha's had much wrong. Lord Cardinall,
1671   The willing'st sinne I euer yet committed,
1672   May be absolu'd in English.
1673   <S {Card}.> Noble Lady,
1674   I am sorry my integrity should breed,
1675   (And seruice to his Maiesty and you)
1676   So deepe suspition, where all faith was meant;
1677   We come not by the way of Accusation,
1678   To taint that honour euery good Tongue blesses;
1679   Nor to betray you any way to sorrow;
1680   You haue too much good Lady: But to know
1681   How you stand minded in the waighty difference
1682   Betweene the King and you, and to deliuer
1683   (Like free and honest men) our iust opinions,
1684   And comforts to our cause.
1685   <S {Camp}.> Most honour'd Madam,
1686   My Lord of Yorke, out of his Noble nature,
1687   Zeale and obedience he still bore your Grace,
1688   Forgetting (like a good man) your late Censure
1689   Both of his truth and him (which was too farre)
1690   Offers, as I doe, in a signe of peace,
1691   His Seruice, and his Counsell.
1692   <S {Queen}.> To betray me.
1693   My Lords, I thanke you both for your good wills,
1694   Ye speake like honest men, (pray God ye proue so)
1695   But how to make ye sodainly an Answere
1696   In such a poynt of weight, so neere mine Honour,
1697   (More neere my Life I feare) with my weake wit;
1698   And to such men of grauity and learning;
1699   In truth I know not. I was set at worke,
1700   Among my Maids, full little (God knowes) looking
1701   Either for such men, or such businesse;
1702   For her sake that I haue beene, for I feele
1703   The last fit of my Greatnesse; good your Graces
1704   Let me haue time and Councell for my Cause:
1705   Alas, I am a Woman frendlesse, hopelesse.
1706   <S {Wol}.> Madam,
1707   You wrong the Kings loue with these feares,
1708   Your hopes and friends are infinite.
1709   <S {Queen}.> In England,
1710   But little for my profit can you thinke Lords,
1711   That any English man dare giue me Councell?
1712   Or be a knowne friend 'gainst his Highnes pleasure,
1713   (Though he be growne so desperate to be honest)
1714   And liue a Subiect? Nay forsooth, my Friends,
1715   They that must weigh out my afflictions,
1716   They that my trust must grow to, liue not heere,
1717   They are (as all my other comforts) far hence
1718   In mine owne Countrey Lords.
1719   <S {Camp}.> I would your Grace
1720   Would leaue your greefes, and take my Counsell.
1721   <S {Queen}.> How Sir?
1722  *<S {Camp}.> Put your maine cause into the Kings protection,
1723   Hee's louing and most gracious. 'Twill be much,
1724   Both for your Honour better, and your Cause:
1725   For if the tryall of the Law o'retake ye,
1726   You'l part away disgrac'd.
1727   <S {Wol}.> He tels you rightly.
1728   <S {Queen}.> Ye tell me what ye wish for both, my ruine:
1729   Is this your Christian Councell? Out vpon ye.
1730   Heauen is aboue all yet; there sits a Iudge,
1731   That no King can corrupt.
1732   <S {Camp}.> Your rage mistakes vs.
1733  *<S {Queen}.> The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye,
1734   Vpon my Soule two reuerend Cardinall Vertues:
1735   But Cardinall Sins, and hollow hearts I feare ye:
1736   Mend 'em for shame my Lords: Is this your comfort?
1737   The Cordiall that ye bring a wretched Lady?
1738   A woman lost among ye, laugh't at, scornd?
1739   I will not wish ye halfe my miseries,
      <P v4><C B>
1740   I haue more Charity. But say I warn'd ye;
1741   Take heed, for heauens sake take heed, least at once
1742   The burthen of my sorrowes, fall vpon ye.
1743   <S {Car}.> Madam, this is a meere distraction,
1744   You turne the good we offer, into enuy.
1745   <S {Quee}.> Ye turne me into nothing. Woe vpon ye,
1746   And all such false Professors. Would you haue me
1747   (If you haue any Iustice, any Pitty,
1748   If ye be any thing but Churchmens habits)
1749   Put my sicke cause into his hands, that hates me?
1750   Alas, #ha's banish'd me his Bed already,
1751   His Loue, too long ago. I am old my Lords,
1752   And all the Fellowship I hold now with him
1753   Is onely my Obedience. What can happen
1754   To me, aboue this wretchednesse? All your Studies
1755   Make me a Curse, like this.
1756   <S {Camp}.> Your feares are worse.
1757   <S {Qu}.> Haue I liu'd thus long (let me speake my selfe,
1758   Since Vertue findes no friends) a Wife, a true one?
1759   A Woman (I dare say without Vainglory)
1760   Neuer yet branded with Suspition?
1761   Haue I, with all my full Affections
1762  *Still met the King? Lou'd him next Heau'n? Obey'd him?
1763   Bin (out of fondnesse) superstitious to him?
1764   Almost forgot my Prayres to content him?
1765   And am I thus rewarded? 'Tis not well Lords.
1766   Bring me a constant woman to her Husband,
1767   One that ne're dream'd a Ioy, beyond his pleasure;
1768   And to that Woman (when she has done most)
1769   Yet will I adde an Honor; a great Patience.
1770   <S {Car}.> Madam, you wander from the good
1771   We ayme at.
1772   <S {Qu}.> My Lord,
1773   I dare not make my selfe so guiltie,
1774   To giue vp willingly that Noble Title
1775   Your Master wed me to: nothing but death
1776   Shall e're diuorce my Dignities.
1777   <S {Car}.> Pray heare me.
1778   <S {Qu}.> Would I had neuer trod this English Earth,
1779   Or felt the Flatteries that grow vpon it:
1780  *Ye haue Angels Faces; but Heauen knowes your hearts.
1781   What will become of me now, wretched Lady?
1782   I am the most vnhappy Woman liuing.
1783   Alas (poore Wenches) where are now your Fortunes?
1784   Shipwrack'd vpon a Kingdome, where no Pitty,
1785   No Friends, no Hope, no Kindred weepe for me?
1786   Almost no Graue allow'd me? Like the Lilly
1787   That once was Mistris of the Field, and flourish'd,
1788   Ile hang my head, and perish.
1789   <S {Car}.> If your Grace
1790   Could but be brought to know, our Ends are honest,
1791  *Youl'd feele more comfort. Why shold we (good Lady)
1792   Vpon what cause wrong you? Alas, our Places,
1793   The way of our Profession is against it;
1794   We are to Cure such sorrowes, not to sowe 'em.
1795   For Goodnesse sake, consider what you do,
1796   How you may hurt your selfe: #I, vtterly
1797  *Grow from the Kings Acquaintance, by this Carriage.
1798   The hearts of Princes kisse Obedience,
1799   So much they loue it. But to stubborne Spirits,
1800   They swell and grow, as terrible as stormes.
1801   I know you haue a Gentle, Noble temper,
1802   A Soule as euen as a Calme; Pray thinke vs,
1803  *Those we professe, Peace- makers, Friends, and Seruants.
1804   <S {Camp}.> Madam, you'l finde it so:
1805   You wrong your Vertues
1806   With these weake Womens feares. A Noble Spirit
1807   As yours was, put into you, euer casts
1808  *Such doubts as false Coine from it. The King loues you,
1809   Beware you loose it not: For vs (if you please
1810   To trust vs in your businesse) we are ready
1811   To vse our vtmost Studies, in your seruice.
1812   <S {Qu}.> Do what ye will, my Lords:
1813   And pray forgiue me;
1814   If I haue vs'd my selfe vnmannerly,
1815   You know I am a Woman, lacking wit
1816   To make a seemely answer to such persons.
1817   Pray do my seruice to his Maiestie,
1818   He ha's my heart yet, and shall haue my Prayers
1819   While I shall haue my life. Come reuerend Fathers,
1820   Bestow your Councels on me. She now begges
1821   That little thought when she set footing heere,
1822   She should haue bought her Dignities so deere.  <D {Exeunt}>
      <A S>
1823   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1824   <D {Enter the Duke of Norfolke, Duke of Suffolke, Lord Surrey},
1825   {and Lord Chamberlaine}.>
1826   <S {Norf}.> If you will now vnite in your Complaints,
1827   And force them with a Constancy, the Cardinall
1828   Cannot stand vnder them. If you omit
1829   The offer of this time, I cannot promise,
1830   But that you shall sustaine moe new disgraces,
1831   With these you beare alreadie.
1832   <S {Sur}.> I am ioyfull
1833   To meete the least occasion, that may giue me
1834   Remembrance of my Father- in- Law, the Duke,
1835   To be reueng'd on him.
1836   <S {Suf}.> Which of the Peeres
1837   Haue vncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
1838   Strangely neglected? When did he regard
1839   The stampe of Noblenesse in any person
1840   Out of himselfe?
1841   <S {Cham}.> My Lords, you speake your pleasures:
1842   What he deserues of you and me, I know:
1843   What we can do to him (though now the time
1844   Giues way to vs) I much feare. If you cannot
1845   Barre his accesse to'th' King, neuer attempt
1846   Any thing on him: for he hath a Witchcraft
1847   Ouer the King in's Tongue.
1848   <S {Nor}.> O feare him not,
1849   His spell in that is out: the King hath found
1850   Matter against him, that for euer marres
1851   The Hony of his Language. No, he's setled
1852   (Not to come off) in his displeasure.
1853   <S {Sur}.> Sir,
1854   I should be glad to heare such Newes as this
1855   Once euery houre.
1856   <S {Nor}.> Beleeue it, this is true.
1857   In the Diuorce, his contrarie proceedings
1858   Are all vnfolded: wherein he appeares,
1859   As I would wish mine Enemy.
1860   <S {Sur}.> How came
1861   His practises to light?
1862   <S {Suf}.> Most strangely.
1863   <S {Sur}.> O how? how?
1864   <S {Suf}.> The Cardinals Letters to the Pope miscarried,
      <P v4v>
1865   And came to th' eye o'th' King, wherein was read
1866   How that the Cardinall did intreat his Holinesse
1867   To stay the Iudgement o'th' Diuorce; for if
1868   It did take place, I do (quoth he) perceiue
1869   My King is tangled in affection, to
1870   A Creature of the Queenes, Lady {Anne Bullen}.
1871   <S {Sur}.> Ha's the King this?
1872   <S {Suf}.> Beleeue it.
1873   <S {Sur}.> Will this worke?
1874  *<S {Cham}.> The King in this perceiues him, how he coasts
1875   And hedges his owne way. But in this point
1876   All his trickes founder, and he brings his Physicke
1877   After his Patients death; the King already
1878   Hath married the faire Lady.
1879   <S {Sur}.> Would he had.
1880   <S {Suf}.> May you be happy in your wish my Lord,
1881   For I professe you haue it.
1882   <S {Sur}.> Now all my ioy
1883   Trace the Coniunction.
1884   <S {Suf}.> My Amen too't.
1885   <S {Nor}.> All mens.
1886   <S {Suf}.> There's order giuen for her Coronation:
1887   Marry this is yet but yong, and may be left
1888   To some eares vnrecounted. But my Lords
1889   She is a gallant Creature, and compleate
1890   In minde and feature. I perswade me, from her
1891   Will fall some blessing to this Land, which shall
1892   In it be memoriz'd.
1893   <S {Sur}.> But will the King
1894   Digest this Letter of the Cardinals?
1895   The Lord forbid.
1896   <S {Nor}.> Marry Amen.
1897   <S {Suf}.> No, no:
1898   There be moe Waspes that buz about his Nose,
1899   Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinall {Campeius},
1900   Is stolne away to Rome, hath 'tane no leaue,
1901   #Ha's left the cause o'th' King vnhandled, and
1902   Is posted as the Agent of our Cardinall,
1903   To second all his plot. I do assure you,
1904   The King cry'de Ha, at this.
1905   <S {Cham}.> Now God incense him,
1906   And let him cry Ha, lowder.
1907   <S {Norf}.> But my Lord
1908   When returnes {Cranmer}?
1909   <S {Suf}.> He is return'd in his Opinions, which
1910   Haue satisfied the King for his Diuorce,
1911   Together with all famous Colledges
1912   Almost in Christendome: shortly (I beleeue)
1913   His second Marriage shall be publishd, and
1914   Her Coronation. {Katherine} no more
1915   Shall be call'd Queene, but Princesse Dowager,
1916   And Widdow to Prince {Arthur}.
1917   <S {Nor}.> This same {Cranmer}'s
1918   A worthy Fellow, and hath tane much paine
1919   In the Kings businesse.
1920   <S {Suff}.> He ha's, and we shall see him
1921   For it, an Arch- byshop.
1922   <S {Nor}.> So I heare.
1923   <S {Suf}.> 'Tis so.
1924   <D {Enter Wolsey and Cromwell}.>
1925   The Cardinall.
1926   <S {Nor}.> Obserue, obserue, hee's moody.
1927   <S {Car}.> The Packet Cromwell,
1928   Gau't you the King?
1929   <S {Crom}.> To his owne hand, in's Bed- chamber.
1930   <S {Card}.> Look'd he o'th' inside of the Paper?
1931   <S {Crom}.> Presently
1932   He did vnseale them, and the first he view'd,
1933   He did it with a Serious minde: a heede
1934   Was in his countenance. You he bad
1935   Attend him heere this Morning.
1936   <S {Card}.> Is he ready to come abroad?
1937   <S {Crom}.> I thinke by this he is.
1938   <S {Card}.> Leaue me #a while.  <D {Exit Cromwell}.>
1939   It shall be to the Dutches of Alanson,
1940   The French Kings Sister; He shall marry her.
1941   {#Anne Bullen}? No: Ile no {Anne Bullens} for him,
1942   There's more in't then faire Visage. {Bullen}?
1943   No, wee'l no {Bullens}: Speedily I wish
1944  *To heare from Rome. The Marchionesse of Penbroke?
1945   <S {Nor}.> He's discontented.
1946   <S {Suf}.> Maybe he heares the King
1947   Does whet his Anger to him.
1948   <S {Sur}.> Sharpe enough,
1949   Lord for thy Iustice.
1950   <S {Car}.> The late Queenes Gentlewoman?
1951   A Knights Daughter
1952   To be her Mistris Mistris? The Queenes, Queene?
1953   This Candle burnes not cleere, 'tis I must snuffe it,
1954   Then out it goes. What though I know her vertuous
1955   And well deseruing? yet I know her for
1956   A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholsome to
1957   Our cause, that she should lye i'th' bosome of
1958   Our hard rul'd King. Againe, there is sprung vp
1959   An Heretique, an Arch- one; {Cranmer}, one
1960   Hath crawl'd into the fauour of the King,
1961   And is his Oracle.
1962   <S {Nor}.> He is vex'd at something.
1963   <D {Enter King, reading of a Scedule}.>
1964  *<S {Sur}.> I would 'twer somthing y would fret the string,
1965   The Master- cord on's heart.
1966   <S {Suf}.> The King, the King.
1967   <S {King}.> What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
1968   To his owne portion? And what expence by'th' houre
1969   Seemes to flow from him? How, i'th' name of Thrift
1970   Does he rake this together? Now my Lords,
1971   Saw you the Cardinall?
1972   <S {Nor}.> My Lord, we haue
1973  *Stood heere obseruing him. Some strange Commotion
1974   Is in his braine: He bites his lip, and starts,
1975   Stops on a sodaine, lookes vpon the ground,
1976   Then layes his finger on his Temple: straight
1977   Springs out into fast gate, then stops againe,
1978   Strikes his brest hard, and anon, he casts
1979   His eye against the Moone: in most strange Postures
1980   We haue seene him set himselfe.
1981   <S {King}.> It may well be,
1982   There is a mutiny in's minde. This morning,
1983   Papers of State he sent me, to peruse
1984   As I requir'd: and wot you what I found
1985   There (on my Conscience put vnwittingly)
1986   Forsooth an Inuentory, thus importing
1987   The seuerall parcels of his Plate, his Treasure,
1988   Rich Stuffes and Ornaments of Houshold, which
1989   I finde at such proud Rate, that it out- speakes
1990   Possession of a Subiect.
1991   <S {Nor}.> It's Heauens #will,
1992   Some Spirit put this paper in the Packet,
1993   To blesse your eye withall.
1994   <S {King}.> If we did thinke
      <P v5>
1995   His Contemplation were aboue the earth,
1996   And fixt on Spirituall obiect, he should still
1997   Dwell in his Musings, but I am affraid
1998   His Thinkings are below the Moone, not worth
1999   His serious considering.
2000   <D {#King takes his Seat, whispers Louell, who goes}
2001   {to the Cardinall}.>
2002   <S {Car}.> Heauen forgiue me,
2003   Euer God blesse your Highnesse.
2004   <S {King}.> Good my Lord,
2005  *You are full of Heauenly stuffe, and beare the Inuentory
2006   Of your best Graces, in your minde; the which
2007   You were now running o're: you haue scarse time
2008   To steale from Spirituall leysure, a briefe span
2009   To keepe your earthly Audit, sure in that
2010   I deeme you an #ill Husband, and am glad
2011   To haue you therein my Companion.
2012   <S {Car}.> Sir,
2013   For Holy Offices I haue a time; a time
2014   To thinke vpon the part of businesse, which
2015   I beare i'th' State: and Nature does require
2016   Her times of preseruation, which perforce
2017   I her fraile sonne, among'st my Brethren mortall,
2018   Must giue my tendance to.
2019   <S {King}.> You haue said well.
2020  *<S {Car}.> And euer may your Highnesse yoake together,
2021   (As I will lend you cause) my doing well,
2022   With my well saying.
2023   <S {King}.> 'Tis well said agen,
2024   And 'tis a kinde of good deede to say well,
2025   And yet words are no deeds. My Father lou'd you,
2026   He said he did, and with his deed did Crowne
2027   His word vpon you. Since I had my Office,
2028   I haue kept you next my Heart, haue not alone
2029   Imploy'd you where high Profits might come home,
2030   But par'd my present Hauings, to bestow
2031   My Bounties vpon you.
2032   <S {Car}.> What should this meane?
2033   <S {Sur}.> The Lord increase this businesse.
2034   <S {King}.> Haue I not made you
2035   The prime man of the State? I pray you tell me,
2036   If what I now pronounce, you haue found true:
2037   And if you may confesse it, say withall
2038   If you are bound to vs, or no. What say you?
2039   <S {Car}.> My Soueraigne, I confesse your Royall graces
2040   Showr'd on me daily, haue bene more then could
2041   My studied purposes requite, which went
2042   Beyond all mans endeauors. My endeauors,
2043   Haue euer come too short of my Desires,
2044   Yet fill'd with my Abilities: Mine owne ends
2045   Haue beene mine so, that euermore they pointed
2046   To'th' good of your most Sacred Person, and
2047   The profit of the State. For your great Graces
2048   Heap'd vpon me (poore Vndeseruer) I
2049   Can nothing render but Allegiant thankes,
2050   My Prayres to heauen for you; my Loyaltie
2051   Which euer ha's, and euer shall be growing,
2052   Till death (that Winter) kill it.
2053   <S {King}.> Fairely answer'd:
2054   A Loyall, and obedient Subiect is
2055   Therein illustrated, the Honor of it
2056   Does pay the Act of it, as i'th' contrary
2057   The fowlenesse is the punishment. I presume,
2058   That as my hand ha's open'd Bounty to you,
2059   My heart drop'd Loue, my powre rain'd Honor, more
2060   On you, then any: So your Hand, and Heart,
2061   Your Braine, and euery Function of your power,
2062   Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
2063   As 'twer in Loues particular, be more
2064   To me your Friend, then any.
2065   <S {Car}.> I do professe,
2066   That for your Highnesse good, I euer labour'd
2067   More then mine owne: that am, haue, and will be
2068   (Though all the world should cracke their duty to you,
2069   And throw it from their Soule, though perils did
2070   Abound, as thicke as thought could make 'em, and
2071   Appeare in formes more horrid) yet my Duty,
2072   As doth a Rocke against the chiding Flood,
2073   Should the approach of this wilde Riuer breake,
2074   And stand vnshaken yours.
2075   <S {King}.> 'Tis Nobly spoken:
2076   Take notice Lords, he ha's a Loyall brest,
2077   For you haue seene him open't. Read o're this,
2078   And after this, and then to Breakfast with
2079   What appetite you haue.
2080   <D {Exit King, frowning vpon the Cardinall, the Nobles}
2081   {throng after him smiling, and whispering}.>
      <A C>
2082   <S {Car}.> What should this meane?
2083   What sodaine Anger's this? How haue I reap'd it?
2084   He parted Frowning from me, as if Ruine
2085   Leap'd from his Eyes. So lookes the chafed Lyon
2086   Vpon the daring Huntsman that has gall'd him:
2087   Then makes him nothing. I must reade this paper:
2088   I feare the Story of his Anger. 'Tis so:
2089   This paper ha's vndone me: 'Tis th' Accompt
2090   Of all that world of Wealth I haue drawne together
2091   For mine owne ends, (Indeed to gaine the Popedome,
2092   And fee my Friends in Rome.) O Negligence!
2093   Fit for a Foole to fall by: What crosse Diuell
2094   Made me put this maine Secret in the Packet
2095   I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
2096   No new deuice to beate this from his Braines?
2097   I know 'twill stirre him strongly; yet I know
2098   A way, if it take right, in spight of Fortune
2099   Will bring me off againe. What's this? {To th' Pope}?
2100   The Letter (as I liue) with all the Businesse
2101   I writ too's Holinesse. Nay then, farewell:
2102   I haue touch'd the highest point of all my Greatnesse,
2103   And from that full Meridian of my Glory,
2104   I haste now to my Setting. I shall fall
2105   Like a bright exhalation in the Euening,
2106   And no man see me more.
2107   <D {Enter to Woolsey, the Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke, the}
2108   {Earle of Surrey, and the Lord Chamberlaine}.>
2109   <S {Nor}.> Heare the Kings pleasure Cardinall,
2110   Who commands you
2111   To render vp the Great Seale presently
2112   Into our hands, and to Confine your selfe
2113   To Asher- house, my Lord of Winchesters,
2114   Till you heare further from his Highnesse.
2115   <S {Car}.> Stay:
2116  *Where's your Commission? Lords, words cannot carrie
2117   Authority so weighty.
2118   <S {Suf}.> Who dare crosse 'em,
2119   Bearing the Kings #will from his mouth expressely?
2120   <S {Car}.> Till I finde more then #will, or words to do it,
2121   (I meane your malice) know, Officious Lords,
2122   I dare, and must deny it. Now I feele
2123   Of what course Mettle ye are molded, Enuy,
2124   How eagerly ye follow my Disgraces
      <P v5v>
2125   As if it fed ye, and how sleeke and wanton
2126   Ye appeare in euery thing may bring my ruine?
2127   Follow your enuious courses, men of Malice;
2128   You haue Christian warrant for 'em, and no doubt
2129   In time will finde their fit Rewards. That Seale
2130   You aske with such a Violence, the King
2131   (Mine, and your Master) with his owne hand, gaue me:
2132   Bad me enioy it, with the Place, and Honors
2133   During my life; and to confirme his Goodnesse,
2134   Ti'de it by Letters Patents. Now, who'll take it?
2135   <S {Sur}.> The King that gaue it.
2136   <S {Car}.> It must be himselfe then.
2137   <S {Sur}.> Thou art a proud Traitor, Priest.
2138   <S {Car}.> Proud Lord, thou lyest:
2139   Within these fortie houres, Surrey durst better
2140   Haue burnt that Tongue, then saide so.
2141   <S {Sur}.> Thy Ambition
2142   (Thou Scarlet sinne) robb'd this bewailing Land
2143   Of Noble Buckingham, my Father- in- Law,
2144   The heads of all thy Brother- Cardinals,
2145   (With thee, and all thy best parts bound together)
2146   Weigh'd not a haire of his. Plague of your policie,
2147   You sent me Deputie for Ireland,
2148   Farre from his succour; from the King, from all
2149   That might haue mercie on the fault, thou gau'st him:
2150   Whil'st your great Goodnesse, out of holy pitty,
2151   Absolu'd him with an Axe.
2152   <S {Wol}.> This, and all else
2153   This talking Lord can lay vpon my credit,
2154   I answer, is most false. The Duke by Law
2155   Found his deserts. How innocent I was
2156   From any priuate malice in his end,
2157   His Noble Iurie, and foule Cause can witnesse.
2158   If I lou'd many words, Lord, I should tell you,
2159   You haue as little Honestie, as Honor,
2160   That in the way of Loyaltie, and Truth,
2161   Toward the King, my euer Roiall Master,
2162   Dare mate a sounder man then Surrie can be,
2163   And all that loue his follies.
2164   <S {Sur}.> By my Soule,
2165   Your long Coat (Priest) protects you,
2166   Thou should'st feele
2167   My Sword i'th' life blood of thee else. My Lords,
2168   Can ye endure to heare this Arrogance?
2169   And from this Fellow? If we liue thus tamely,
2170   To be thus Iaded by a peece of Scarlet,
2171   Farewell Nobilitie: let his Grace go forward,
2172   And dare vs with his Cap, like Larkes.
2173   <S {Card}.> All Goodnesse
2174   Is poyson to thy Stomacke.
2175   <S {Sur}.> Yes, that goodnesse
2176   Of gleaning all the Lands wealth into one,
2177   Into your owne hands (Card'nall) by Extortion:
2178   The goodnesse of your intercepted Packets
2179   You writ to'th Pope, against the King: your goodnesse
2180   Since you prouoke me, shall be most notorious.
2181   My Lord of Norfolke, as you are truly Noble,
2182   As you respect the common good, the State
2183   Of our despis'd Nobilitie, our Issues,
2184   (Whom if he liue, will scarse be Gentlemen)
2185   Produce the grand summe of his sinnes, the Articles
2186   Collected from his life. Ile startle you
2187   Worse then the Sacring Bell, when the browne Wench
2188   Lay kissing in your Armes, Lord Cardinall.
2189  *<S {Car}.> How much me thinkes, I could despise this man,
2190   But that I am bound in Charitie against it.
2191  *<S {Nor}.> Those Articles, my Lord, are in the Kings hand:
2192   But thus much, they are foule ones.
2193   <S {Wol}.> So much fairer
2194   And spotlesse, shall mine Innocence arise,
2195   When the King knowes my Truth.
2196   <S {Sur}.> This cannot saue you:
2197   I thanke my Memorie, I yet remember
2198   Some of these Articles, and out they shall.
2199   Now, if you can blush, and crie guiltie Cardinall,
2200   You'l shew a little Honestie.
2201   <S {Wol}.> Speake on Sir,
2202   I dare your worst Obiections: If I blush,
2203   It is to see a Nobleman want manners.
2204   <S {Sur}.> I had rather want those, then my head;
2205   Haue at you.
2206   First, that without the Kings assent or knowledge,
2207   You wrought to be a Legate, by which power
2208   You maim'd the Iurisdiction of all Bishops.
2209   <S {Nor}.> Then, That in all you writ to Rome, or else
2210   To Forraigne Princes, {Ego & Rex meus}
2211   Was still inscrib'd: in which you brought the King
2212   To be your Seruant.
2213   <S {Suf}.> Then, that without the knowledge
2214   Either of King or Councell, when you went
2215   Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold
2216   To carry into Flanders, the Great Seale.
2217   <S {Sur}.> Item, You sent a large Commission
2218   To {Gregory de Cassado}, to conclude
2219   Without the Kings #will, or the States allowance,
2220   A League betweene his Highnesse, and {Ferrara}.
2221   <S {Suf}.> That out of meere Ambition, you haue caus'd
2222   Your holy- Hat to be stampt on the Kings Coine.
2223  *<S {Sur}.> Then, That you haue sent inumerable substance,
2224  *(By what meanes got, I leaue to your owne conscience)
2225   To furnish Rome, and to prepare the wayes
2226   You haue for Dignities, to the meere vndooing
2227   Of all the Kingdome. Many more there are,
2228   Which since they are of you, and odious,
2229   I will not taint my mouth with.
2230   <S {Cham}.> O my Lord,
2231   Presse not a falling man too farre: 'tis Vertue:
2232   His faults lye open to the Lawes, let them
2233   (Not you) correct him. My heart weepes to see him
2234   So little, of his great Selfe.
2235   <S {Sur}.> I forgiue him.
2236   <S {Suf}.> Lord Cardinall, the Kings further pleasure is,
2237   Because all those things you haue done of late
2238   By your power Legatine within this Kingdome,
2239   Fall into 'th' compasse of a Premunire;
2240   That therefore such a Writ be sued against you,
2241   To forfeit all your Goods, Lands, Tenements,
2242   Castles, and whatsoeuer, and to be
2243   Out of the Kings protection. This is my Charge.
2244   <S {Nor}.> And so wee'l leaue you to your Meditations
2245   How to liue better. For your stubborne answer
2246   About the giuing backe the Great Seale to vs,
2247  *The King shall know it, and (no doubt) shal thanke you.
2248   So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinall.
2249   <D {Exeunt all but Wolsey}.>
2250   <S {Wol}.> So farewell, to the little good you beare me.
2251   Farewell? A long farewell to all my Greatnesse.
2252   This is the state of Man; to day he puts forth
2253   The tender Leaues of hopes, to morrow Blossomes,
2254   And beares his blushing Honors thicke vpon him:
2255   The third day, comes a Frost; a killing Frost,
2256   And when he thinkes, good easie man, full surely
      <P v6>
2257   His Greatnesse is #a ripening, nippes his roote,
2258   And then he fals as I do. I haue ventur'd
2259   Like little wanton Boyes that swim on bladders:
2260   This many Summers in a Sea of Glory,
2261   But farre beyond my depth: my high- blowne Pride
2262   At length broke vnder me, and now ha's left me
2263   Weary, and old with Seruice, to the mercy
2264   Of a rude streame, that must for euer hide me.
2265   Vaine pompe, and glory of this World, I hate ye,
2266   I feele my heart new open'd. Oh how wretched
2267   Is that poore man, that hangs on Princes fauours?
2268   There is betwixt that smile we would aspire #too,
2269   That sweet Aspect of Princes, and their ruine,
2270   More pangs, and feares then warres, or women haue;
2271   And when he falles, he falles like Lucifer,
2272   Neuer to hope againe.
2273   <D {Enter Cromwell, standing amazed}.>
2274   Why how now {Cromwell}?
2275   <S {Crom}.> I haue no power to speake Sir.
2276   <S {Car}.> What, amaz'd
2277   At my misfortunes? Can thy Spirit wonder
2278   A great man should decline. Nay, #and you weep
2279   I am falne indeed.
2280   <S {Crom}.> How does your Grace.
2281   <S {Card}.> Why well:
2282   Neuer so truly happy, my good {Cromwell},
2283   I know my selfe now, and I feele within me,
2284   A peace aboue all earthly Dignities,
2285   A still, and quiet Conscience. The King ha's cur'd me,
2286   I humbly thanke his Grace: and from these shoulders
2287   These ruin'd Pillers, out of pitty, taken
2288   A loade, would sinke a Nauy, (too much Honor.)
2289   O 'tis a burden {Cromwel}, 'tis a burden
2290   Too heauy for a man, that hopes for Heauen.
2291   <S {Crom}.> I am glad your Grace,
2292   Ha's made that right vse of it.
2293   <S {Card}.> I hope I haue:
2294   I am able now (me thinkes)
2295   (Out of a Fortitude of Soule, I feele)
2296   To endure more Miseries, and greater farre
2297   Then my Weake- hearted Enemies, dare offer.
2298   What Newes abroad?
2299   <S {Crom}.> The heauiest, and the worst,
2300   Is your displeasure with the King.
2301   <S {Card}.> God blesse him.
2302   <S {Crom}.> The next is, that Sir {Thomas Moore} is chosen
2303   Lord Chancellor, in your place.
2304   <S {Card}.> That's somewhat sodain.
2305   But he's a Learned man. May he continue
2306   Long in his Highnesse fauour, and do Iustice
2307   For Truths- sake, and his Conscience; that his bones,
2308   When he ha's run his course, and sleepes in Blessings,
2309   May haue a Tombe of Orphants teares wept on him.
2310   What more?
2311   <S {Crom}.> That {Cranmer} is return'd with welcome;
2312   Install'd Lord Arch- byshop of Canterbury.
2313   <S {Card}.> That's Newes indeed.
2314   <S {Crom}.> Last, that the Lady {Anne},
2315   Whom the King hath in secrecie long married,
2316   This day was view'd in open, as his Queene,
2317   Going to Chappell: and the voyce is now
2318   Onely about her Corronation.
2319   <S {Card}.> There was the waight that pull'd me downe.
2320   O {Cromwell},
2321   The King ha's gone beyond me: All my Glories
2322   In that one woman, I haue lost for euer.
2323   No Sun, shall euer vsher forth mine Honors,
2324   Or gilde againe the Noble Troopes that waighted
2325   Vpon my smiles. Go get thee from me {Cromwel},
2326   I am a poore falne man, vnworthy now
2327   To be thy Lord, and Master. Seeke the King
2328   (That Sun, I pray may neuer set) I haue told him,
2329   What, and how true thou art; he will aduance thee:
2330   Some little memory of me, will stirre him
2331   (I know his Noble Nature) not to let
2332   Thy hopefull seruice perish too. Good {Cromwell}
2333   Neglect him not; make vse now, and prouide
2334   For thine owne future safety.
2335   <S {Crom}.> O my Lord,
2336   Must I then leaue you? Must I needes forgo
2337   So good, so Noble, and so true a Master?
2338   Beare witnesse, all that haue not hearts of Iron,
2339   With what a sorrow {Cromwel} leaues his Lord.
2340   The King shall haue my seruice; but my prayres
2341   For euer, and for euer shall be yours.
2342   <S {Card}.> {Cromwel}, I did not thinke to shed a teare
2343   In all my Miseries: But thou hast forc'd me
2344   (Out of thy honest truth) to play the Woman.
2345   Let's dry our eyes: And thus farre heare me {Cromwel},
2346   And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
2347   And sleepe in dull cold Marble, where no mention
2348   Of me, more must be heard of: Say I taught thee;
2349   Say {Wolsey}, that once trod the wayes of Glory,
2350   And sounded all the Depths, and Shoales of Honor,
2351   Found thee a way (out of his wracke) to rise in:
2352   A sure, and safe one, though thy Master mist it.
2353   Marke but my Fall, and that that Ruin'd me:
2354   {Cromwel}, I charge thee, fling away Ambition,
2355   By that sinne fell the Angels: how can man then
2356   (The Image of his Maker) hope to win by it?
2357   Loue thy selfe last, cherish those hearts that hate thee;
2358   Corruption wins not more then Honesty.
2359   Still in thy right hand, carry gentle Peace
2360   To silence enuious Tongues. Be iust, and feare not;
2361   Let all the ends thou aym'st at, be thy Countries,
2362  *Thy Gods, and Truths. Then if thou fall'st (O {Cromwell})
2363   Thou fall'st a blessed Martyr.
2364   Serue the King: And prythee leade me in:
2365   There take an Inuentory of all I haue,
2366   To the last peny, 'tis the Kings. My Robe,
2367   And my Integrity to Heauen, is all,
2368   I dare now call mine owne. O {Cromwel}, {Cromwel},
2369   Had I but seru'd my God, with halfe the Zeale
2370   I seru'd my King: he would not in mine Age
2371   Haue left me naked to mine Enemies.
2372   <S {Crom}.> Good Sir, haue patience.
2373   <S {Card}.> So I haue. Farewell
2374   The Hopes of Court, my Hopes in Heauen do dwell.
2375   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A D>
2376   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
2377   <D {Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another}.>
2378   <S 1> Y'are well met once againe.
2379   <S 2> So are you.
2380   <S 1> You come to take your stand heere, and behold
2381   The Lady {Anne}, passe from her Corronation.
      <P v6v>
2382   <S 2> 'Tis all my businesse. At our last encounter,
2383   The Duke of Buckingham came from his Triall.
2384   <S 1> 'Tis very true. But that time offer'd sorrow,
2385   This generall ioy.
2386   <S 2> 'Tis well: The Citizens
2387   I am sure haue shewne at full their Royall minds,
2388   As let 'em haue their rights, they are euer forward
2389   In Celebration of this day with Shewes,
2390   Pageants, and Sights of Honor.
2391   <S 1> Neuer greater,
2392   Nor Ile assure you better taken Sir.
2393   <S 2> May I be bold to aske what that containes,
2394   That Paper in your hand.
2395   <S 1> Yes, 'tis the List
2396   Of those that claime their Offices this day,
2397   By custome of the Coronation.
2398   The Duke of Suffolke is the first, and claimes
2399   To be high Steward; Next the Duke of Norfolke,
2400   He to be Earle Marshall: you may reade the rest.
2401  *<S 1> I thanke you Sir: Had I not known those customs,
2402   I should haue beene beholding to your Paper:
2403   But I beseech you, what's become of {Katherine}
2404   The Princesse Dowager? How goes her businesse?
2405   <S 1> That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
2406   Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
2407   Learned, and Reuerend Fathers of his Order,
2408   Held a late Court at Dunstable; sixe miles off
2409   From Ampthill, where the Princesse lay, to which
2410   She was often cyted by them, but appear'd not:
2411   And to be short, for not Appearance, and
2412   The Kings late Scruple, by the maine assent
2413   Of all these Learned men, she was diuorc'd,
2414   And the late Marriage made of none effect:
2415   Since which, she was remou'd to Kymmalton,
2416   Where she remaines now sicke.
2417   <S 2> Alas good Lady.
2418   The Trumpets sound: Stand close,
2419   The Queene is comming.  <D {Ho- boyes}.
2420   The Order of the Coronation.
2421   1 {A liuely Flourish of Trumpets}.
2422   2 {Then, two Iudges}.
2423   3 {Lord} Chancellor, {with Purse and Mace before him}.
2424   4 Quirristers {singing}.  Musicke.
2425  *5 Maior of London, {bearing the Mace. Then} Garter, {in}
2426  *{his Coate of Armes, and on his head he wore a Gilt Copper}
2427   {Crowne}.
2428  *6 Marquesse Dorset, {bearing a Scepter of Gold, on his head},
2429  *{a Demy Coronall of Gold. With him, the Earle of} Surrey,
2430  *{bearing the Rod of Siluer with the Doue, Crowned with an}
2431   {Earles Coronet. Collars of Esses}.
2432  *7 Duke of Suffolke, {in his Robe of Estate, his Coronet on his}
2433  *{head, bearing a long white Wand, as High Steward. With}
2434  *{him,  the Duke of} Norfolke, {with the Rod of Marshalship},
2435   {a Coronet on his head. Collars of Esses}.
2436  *8 {A} Canopy, {borne by foure of the} Cinque- Ports, {vnder it}
2437  *{the  Queene in her Robe, in her haire, richly adorned with}
2438  *{Pearle, Crowned. On each side her, the Bishops of} London,
2439   {and} Winchester.
2440  *9 {The} Olde Dutchesse of Norfolke, {in a Coronall of Gold},
2441   {wrought with Flowers bearing the Queenes Traine}.
2442  *10 {Certaine} Ladies {or} Countesses, {with plaine Circlets of}
2443   {Gold, without Flowers}.
2444  *Exeunt, {first passing ouer the Stage in Order and State, and}
2445   {then, A great Flourish of Trumpets}.>
2446   <S 2> A Royall Traine beleeue me: These I know:
2447   Who's that that beares the Scepter?
2448   <S 1> Marquesse Dorset,
2449   And that the Earle of Surrey, with the Rod.
2450   <S 2> A bold braue Gentleman. That should bee
2451   The Duke of Suffolke.
2452   <S 1> 'Tis the same: high Steward.
2453   <S 2> And that my Lord of Norfolke?
2454   <S 1> Yes.
2455   <S 2> Heauen blesse thee,
2456   Thou hast the sweetest face I euer look'd on.
2457   Sir, as I haue a Soule, she is an Angell;
2458   Our King ha's all the Indies in his Armes,
2459   And more, and richer, when he straines that Lady,
2460   I cannot blame his Conscience.
2461   <S 1> They that beare
2462   The Cloath of Honour ouer her, are foure Barons
2463   Of the Cinque- Ports.
2464   <S 2> Those men are happy,
2465   And so are all, are neere her.
2466   I take it, she that carries vp the Traine,
2467   Is that old Noble Lady, Dutchesse of Norfolke.
2468   <S 1> It is, and all the rest are Countesses.
2469   <S 2> Their Coronets say so. These are Starres indeed,
2470   And sometimes falling ones.
2471   <S 2> No more of that.
2472   <D {Enter a third Gentleman}.>
2473  *<S 1> God saue you Sir. Where haue you bin broiling?
2474   <S 3> Among the crowd i'th' Abbey, where a finger
2475   Could not be wedg'd in more: I am stifled
2476   With the meere ranknesse of their ioy.
2477   <S 2> You saw the Ceremony?
2478   <S 3> That I did.
2479   <S 1> How was it?
2480   <S 3> Well worth the seeing.
2481   <S 2> Good Sir, speake it to vs?
2482   <S 3> As well as I am able. The rich streame
2483   Of Lords, and Ladies, hauing brought the Queene
2484   To a prepar'd place in the Quire, fell off
2485   A distance from her; while her Grace sate downe
2486   To rest #a while, some halfe an houre, or so,
2487   In a rich Chaire of State, opposing freely
2488   The Beauty of her Person to the People.
2489   Beleeue me Sir, she is the goodliest Woman
2490   That euer lay by man: which when the people
2491   Had the full view of, such a noyse arose,
2492   As the shrowdes make at Sea, in a stiffe Tempest,
2493   As lowd, and to as many Tunes. Hats, Cloakes,
2494   (Doublets, I thinke) flew vp, and had their Faces
2495   Bin loose, this day they had beene lost. Such ioy
2496   I neuer saw before. Great belly'd women,
2497   That had not halfe a weeke to go, like Rammes
2498   In the old time of Warre, would shake the prease
2499   And make 'em reele before 'em. No man liuing
2500   Could say this is my wife there, all were wouen
2501   So strangely in one peece.
2502   <S 2> But what follow'd?
2503   <S 3> At length, her Grace rose, and with modest paces
2504   Came to the Altar, where she kneel'd, and Saint- like
2505   Cast her faire eyes to Heauen, and pray'd deuoutly.
2506   Then rose againe, and bow'd her to the people:
2507   When by the Arch- byshop of Canterbury,
2508   She had all the Royall makings of a Queene;
2509   As holy Oyle, {Edward} Confessors Crowne,
2510   The Rod, and Bird of Peace, and all such Emblemes
2511   Laid Nobly on her: which perform'd, the Quire
      <P x1>
2512   With all the choysest Musicke of the Kingdome,
2513   Together sung {Te Deum}. So she parted,
2514   And with the same full State pac'd backe againe
2515   To Yorke- Place, where the Feast is held.
2516   <S 1> Sir,
2517   You must no more call it Yorke- place, that's past:
2518   For since the Cardinall fell, that Titles lost,
2519   'Tis now the Kings, and call'd White- Hall.
2520   <S 3> I know it:
2521   But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name
2522   Is fresh about me.
2523   <S 2> What two Reuerend Byshops
2524   Were those that went on each side of the Queene?
2525   <S 3> {Stokeley} and {Gardiner}, the one of Winchester,
2526   Newly preferr'd from the Kings Secretary:
2527   The other London.
2528   <S 2> He of Winchester
2529   Is held no great good louer of the Archbishops,
2530   The vertuous {Cranmer}.
2531   <S 3> All the Land knowes that:
2532   How euer, yet there is no great breach, when it comes
2533   {Cranmer} will finde a Friend will not shrinke from him.
2534   <S 2> Who may that be, I pray you.
2535   <S 3> {Thomas Cromwell},
2536   A man in much esteeme with th' King, and truly
2537   A worthy Friend. The King ha's made him
2538   Master o'th' Iewell House,
2539   And one already of the Priuy Councell.
2540   <S 2> He will deserue more.
2541   <S 3> Yes without all doubt.
2542   Come Gentlemen, ye shall go my way,
2543   Which is to'th Court, and there ye shall be my Guests:
2544   Something I can command. As I walke thither,
2545   Ile tell ye more.
2546   <S {Both}.> You may command vs Sir.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A E>
2547   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2548   <D {Enter Katherine Dowager, sicke, lead betweene Griffith},
2549   {her Gentleman Vsher, and Patience}
2550   {her Woman}.>
2551   <S {Grif}.> How do's your Grace?
2552   <S {Kath}.> O {Griffith}, sicke to death:
2553   My Legges like loaden Branches bow to'th' Earth,
2554   Willing to leaue their burthen: Reach a Chaire,
2555   So now (me thinkes) I feele a little ease.
2556   Did'st thou not tell me {Griffith}, as thou lead'st mee,
2557   That the great Childe of Honor, Cardinall {Wolsey}
2558   Was dead?
2559   <S {Grif}.> Yes Madam: but I thinke your Grace
2560   Out of the paine you suffer'd, gaue no eare too't.
2561   <S {Kath}.> Pre'thee good {Griffith}, tell me how he dy'de.
2562   If well, he stept before me happily
2563   For my example.
2564   <S {Grif}.> Well, the voyce goes Madam,
2565   For after the stout Earle Northumberland
2566   Arrested him at Yorke, and brought him forward
2567   As a man sorely tainted, to his Answer,
2568   He fell sicke sodainly, and grew so #ill
2569   He could not sit his Mule.
2570   <S {Kath}.> Alas poore man.
2571   <S {Grif}.> At last, with easie Rodes, he came to Leicester,
2572   Lodg'd in the Abbey; where the reuerend Abbot
2573   With all his Couent, honourably receiu'd him;
2574   To whom he gaue these words. O Father Abbot,
2575   An old man, broken with the stormes of State,
2576   Is come to lay his weary bones among ye:
2577   Giue him a little earth for Charity.
2578   So went to bed; where eagerly his sicknesse
2579   Pursu'd him still, and three nights after this,
2580   About the houre of eight, which he himselfe
2581   Foretold should be his last, full of Repentance,
2582   Continuall Meditations, Teares, and Sorrowes,
2583   He gaue his Honors to the world agen,
2584   His blessed part to Heauen, and slept in peace.
2585   <S {Kath}.> So may he rest,
2586   His Faults lye gently on him:
2587   Yet thus farre {Griffith}, giue me leaue to speake him,
2588   And yet with Charity. He was a man
2589   Of an vnbounded stomacke, euer ranking
2590   Himselfe with Princes. One that by suggestion
2591   Ty'de all the Kingdome. Symonie, was faire play,
2592   His owne Opinion was his Law. I'th' presence
2593   He would say vntruths, and be euer double
2594   Both in his words, and meaning. He was neuer
2595   (But where he meant to Ruine) pittifull.
2596   His Promises, were as he then was, Mighty:
2597   But his performance, as he is now, Nothing:
2598   Of his owne body he was #ill, and gaue
2599   The Clergy #ill example.
2600   <S {Grif}.> Noble Madam:
2601   Mens euill manners, liue in Brasse, their Vertues
2602   We write in Water. May it please your Highnesse
2603   To heare me speake his good now?
2604   <S {Kath}.> Yes good {Griffith},
2605   I were malicious else.
2606   <S {Grif}.> This Cardinall,
2607   Though from an humble Stocke, vndoubtedly
2608   Was fashion'd to much Honor. From his Cradle
2609   He was a Scholler, and a ripe, and good one:
2610   Exceeding wise, faire spoken, and perswading:
2611   Lofty, and sowre to them that lou'd him not:
2612   But, to those men that sought him, sweet as Summer.
2613   And though he were vnsatisfied in getting,
2614   (Which was a sinne) yet in bestowing, Madam,
2615   He was most Princely: Euer witnesse for him
2616   Those twinnes of Learning, that he rais'd in you,
2617   Ipswich and Oxford: one of which, fell with him,
2618   Vnwilling to out- liue the good that did it.
2619   The other (though vnfinish'd) yet so Famous,
2620   So excellent in #Art, and still so rising,
2621   That Christendome shall euer speake his Vertue.
2622   His Ouerthrow, heap'd Happinesse vpon him:
2623   For then, and not till then, he felt himselfe,
2624   And found the Blessednesse of being little.
2625   And to adde greater Honors to his Age
2626   Then man could giue him; he dy'de, fearing God.
2627   <S {Kath}.> After my death, I wish no other Herald,
2628   No other speaker of my liuing Actions,
2629   To keepe mine Honor, from Corruption,
2630   But such an honest Chronicler as {Griffith}.
2631   Whom I most hated Liuing, thou hast made mee
2632   With thy Religious Truth, and Modestie,
2633   (Now in his Ashes) Honor: Peace be with him.
2634   {Patience}, be neere me still, and set me lower,
2635   I haue not long to trouble thee. Good {Griffith},
2636   Cause the Musitians play me that sad note
2637   I nam'd my Knell; whil'st I sit meditating
      <P x1v>
2638   On that Coelestiall Harmony I go #too.
2639   <D {Sad and solemne Musicke}.>
2640   <S {Grif}.> She is asleep: Good wench, let's sit down quiet,
2641   For feare we wake her. Softly, gentle {Patience}.
2642   <D {The Vision}.
2643  *{Enter solemnely tripping one after another, sixe Personages},
2644  *{clad in white Robes, wearing on their heades Garlands of}
2645  *{Bayes, and golden Vizards on their faces, Branches of Bayes}
2646  *{or Palme in their hands. They first Conge vnto her, then}
2647  *{Dance: and at certaine Changes, the first two hold a spare}
2648  *{Garland ouer her Head, at which the other foure make re-uerend}
2649  *{Curtsies. Then the two that held the Garland, {deli-uer}
2650  *{the same to the other next two, who obserue the same or-der}
2651  *{in their Changes, and holding the Garland ouer her}
2652  *{head. Which done, they deliuer the same Garland to the}
2653  *{last two: who likewise obserue the same Order. At which}
2654  *{(as it were by inspiration) she makes (in her sleepe) signes of}
2655  *{reioycing, and holdeth vp her hands to heauen. And so, in}
2656  *{their Dancing vanish, carrying the Garland with them}.
2657   {The Musicke continues}.>
2658  *<S {Kath}.> Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone?
2659   And leaue me heere in wretchednesse, behinde ye?
2660   <S {Grif}.> Madam, we are heere.
2661   <S {Kath}.> It is not you I call for,
2662   Saw ye none enter since I slept?
2663   <S {Grif}.> None Madam.
2664   <S {Kath}.> No? Saw you not euen now a blessed Troope
2665   Inuite me to a Banquet, whose bright faces
2666   Cast thousand beames vpon me, like the Sun?
2667   They promis'd me eternall Happinesse,
2668   And brought me Garlands ({Griffith}) which I feele
2669   I am not worthy yet to weare: I shall assuredly.
2670   <S {Grif}.> I am most ioyfull Madam, such good dreames
2671   Possesse your Fancy.
2672   <S {Kath}.> Bid the Musicke leaue,
2673   They are harsh and heauy to me.  <D {Musicke ceases}.>
2674   <S {Pati}.> Do you note
2675   How much her Grace is alter'd on the sodaine?
2676   How long her face is drawne? How pale she lookes,
2677   And of an earthy cold? Marke her eyes?
2678   <S {Grif}.> She is going Wench. Pray, pray.
2679   <S {Pati}.> Heauen comfort her.
2680   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2681   <S {Mes}.> And't like your Grace ===
2682   <S {Kath}.> You are a sawcy Fellow,
2683   Deserue we no more Reuerence?
2684   <S {Grif}.> You are #too blame,
2685   Knowing she will not loose her wonted Greatnesse
2686   To vse so rude behauiour. Go #too, kneele.
2687   <S {Mes}.> I humbly do entreat your Highnesse pardon,
2688   My #hast made me vnmannerly. There is staying
2689   A Gentleman sent from the King, to see you.
2690  *<S {Kath}.> Admit him entrance {Griffith}. But this Fellow
2691   Let me ne're see againe.  <D {Exit Messeng}.>
2692   <D {Enter Lord Capuchius}.>
2693   If my sight faile not,
2694   You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor,
2695   My Royall Nephew, and your name {Capuchius}.
2696   <S {Cap}.> Madam the same. Your Seruant.
2697   <S {Kath}.> O my Lord,
2698   The Times and Titles now are alter'd strangely
2699   With me, since first you knew me.
2700   But I pray you,
2701   What is your pleasure with me?
2702   <S {Cap}.> Noble Lady,
2703   First mine owne seruice to your Grace, the next
2704   The Kings request, that I would visit you,
2705   Who greeues much for your weaknesse, and by me
2706   Sends you his Princely Commendations,
2707   And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
2708  *<S {Kath}.> O my good Lord, that comfort comes too late,
2709   'Tis like a Pardon after Execution;
2710   That gentle Physicke giuen in time, had cur'd me:
2711   But now I am past all Comforts heere, but Prayers.
2712   How does his Highnesse?
2713   <S {Cap}.> Madam, in good health.
2714   <S {Kath}.> So may he euer do, and euer flourish,
2715   When I shall dwell with Wormes, and my poore name
2716   Banish'd the Kingdome. {Patience}, is that Letter
2717   I caus'd you write, yet sent away?
2718   <S {Pat}.> No Madam.
2719   <S {Kath}.> Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliuer
2720   This to my Lord the King.
2721   <S {Cap}.> Most willing Madam.
2722   <S {Kath}.> In which I haue commended to his goodnesse
2723   The Modell of our chaste loues: his yong daughter,
2724   The dewes of Heauen fall thicke in Blessings on her,
2725   Beseeching him to giue her vertuous breeding.
2726   She is yong, and of a Noble modest Nature,
2727   I hope she will deserue well; and a little
2728   To loue her for her Mothers sake, that lou'd him,
2729   Heauen knowes how deerely.
2730   My next poore Petition,
2731   Is, that his Noble Grace would haue some pittie
2732   Vpon my wretched women, that so long
2733   Haue follow'd both my Fortunes, faithfully,
2734   Of which there is not one, I dare auow
2735   (And now I should not lye) but will deserue
2736   For Vertue, and true Beautie of the Soule,
2737   For honestie, and decent Carriage
2738   A right good Husband (let him be a Noble)
2739   And sure those men are happy that shall haue 'em.
2740   The last is for my men, they are the poorest,
2741   (But pouerty could neuer draw 'em from me)
2742   That they may haue their wages, duly paid 'em,
2743   And something ouer to remember me by.
2744   If Heauen had pleas'd to haue giuen me longer life
2745   And able meanes, we had not parted thus.
2746   These are the whole Contents, and good my Lord,
2747   By that you loue the deerest in this world,
2748   As you wish Christian peace to soules departed,
2749   Stand these poore peoples Friend, and vrge the King
2750   To do me this last right.
2751   <S {Cap}.> By Heauen I will,
2752   Or let me loose the fashion of a man.
2753   <S {Kath}.> I thanke you honest Lord. Remember me
2754   In all humilitie vnto his Highnesse:
2755   Say his long trouble now is passing
2756   Out of this world. Tell him in death I blest him
2757   (For so I will) mine eyes grow dimme. Farewell
2758   My Lord. {Griffith} farewell. Nay {Patience},
2759   You must not leaue me yet. I must to bed,
2760   Call in more women. When I am dead, good Wench,
2761   Let me be vs'd with Honor; strew me ouer
2762   With Maiden Flowers, that all the world may know
2763   I was a chaste Wife, to my Graue: Embalme me,
2764   Then lay me forth (although vnqueen'd) yet like
2765   A Queene, and Daughter to a King enterre me.
2766   I can no more.

2771   <S {Gard}.> It's one #a clocke Boy, is't not.
2772   <S {Boy}.> It hath strooke.
2773   <S {Gard}.> These should be houres for necessities,
2774   Not for delights: Times to repayre our Nature
2775   With comforting repose, and not for vs
2776  *To waste these times. Good houre of night Sir {Thomas}:
2777   Whether so late?
2778   <S {Lou}.> Came you from the King, my Lord?
2779   <S {Gar}.> I did Sir {Thomas}, and left him at Primero
2780   With the Duke of Suffolke.
2781   <S {Lou}.> I must to him too
2782   Before he go to bed. Ile take my leaue.
2783  *<S {Gard}.> Not yet Sir {Thomas Louell}: what's the matter?
2784   It seemes you are in #hast: #and if there be
2785   No great offence belongs too't, giue your Friend
2786   Some touch of your late businesse: Affaires that walke
2787   (As they say Spirits do) at midnight, haue
2788   In them a wilder Nature, then the businesse
2789   That seekes dispatch by day.
2790   <S {Lou}.> My Lord, I loue you;
2791   And durst commend a secret to your eare
2792  *Much waightier then this worke. The Queens in Labor
2793   They say in great Extremity, and fear'd
2794   Shee'l with the Labour, end.
2795   <S {Gard}.> The fruite she goes with
2796   I pray for heartily, that it may finde
2797   Good time, and liue: but for the Stocke Sir {Thomas},
2798   I wish it grubb'd vp now.
2799   <S {Lou}.> Me thinkes I could
2800   Cry the Amen, and yet my Conscience sayes
2801   Shee's a good Creature, and sweet- Ladie do's
2802   Deserue our better wishes.
2803   <S {Gard}.> But Sir, Sir,
2804   Heare me Sir {Thomas}, y'are a Gentleman
2805   Of mine owne way. I know you Wise, Religious,
2806   And let me tell you, it will ne're be well,
2807   'Twill not Sir {Thomas Louell}, tak't of me,
2808   Till {Cranmer}, {Cromwel}, her two hands, and shee
2809   Sleepe in their Graues.
2810   <S {Louell}.> Now Sir, you speake of two
2811   The most remark'd i'th' Kingdome: as for {Cromwell},
2812   Beside that of the Iewell- House, is made Master
2813   O'th' Rolles, and the Kings Secretary. Further Sir,
2814   Stands in the gap and Trade of moe Preferments,
2815   With which the Lime will loade him. Th' Archbyshop
2816   Is the Kings hand, and tongue, and who dare speak
2817   One syllable against him?
2818   <S {Gard}.> Yes, yes, Sir {Thomas},
2819   There are that Dare, and I my selfe haue ventur'd
2820   To speake my minde of him: and indeed this day,
2821   Sir (I may tell it you) I thinke I haue
2822   Incenst the Lords o'th' Councell, that he is
2823   (For so I know he is, they know he is)
2824   A most Arch- Heretique, a Pestilence
2825   That does infect the Land: with which, they moued
2826   Haue broken with the King, who hath so farre
2827   Giuen eare to our Complaint, of his great Grace,
2828   And Princely Care, fore- seeing those fell Mischiefes,
2829   Our Reasons layd before him, hath commanded
2830   To morrow Morning to the Councell Boord
2831   He be conuented. He's a ranke weed Sir {Thomas},
2832   And we must root him out. From your Affaires
2833   I hinder you too long: Good night, Sir {Thomas}.
2834   <D {Exit Gardiner and Page}.>
2835  *<S {Lou}.> Many good nights, my Lord, I rest your seruant.
2836   <D {Enter King and Suffolke}.>
2837   <S {King}.> {Charles}, I will play no more to night,
2838   My mindes not on't, you are too hard for me.
2839   <S {Suff}.> Sir, I did neuer win of you before.
2840   <S {King}.> But little {Charles},
2841   Nor shall not when my Fancies on my play.
2842   Now {Louel}, from the Queene what is the Newes.
2843   <S {Lou}.> I could not personally deliuer to her
2844   What you commanded me, but by her woman,
2845   I sent your Message, who return'd her thankes
2846   In the great'st humblenesse, and desir'd your Highnesse
2847   Most heartily to pray for her.
2848   <S {King}.> What say'st thou? Ha?
2849   To pray for her? What is she crying out?
2850  *<S {Lou}.> So said her woman, and that her suffrance made
2851   Almost each pang, a death.
2852   <S {King}.> Alas good Lady.
2853   <S {Suf}.> God safely quit her of her Burthen, and
2854   With gentle Trauaile, to the gladding of
2855   Your Highnesse with an Heire.
2856   <S {King}.> 'Tis midnight {Charles},
2857   Prythee to bed, and in thy Prayres remember
2858   Th' estate of my poore Queene. Leaue me alone,
2859   For I must thinke of that, which company
2860   Would not be friendly #too.
2861   <S {Suf}.> I wish your Highnesse
2862   A quiet night, and my good Mistris will
2863   Remember in my Prayers.
2864   <S {King}.> {Charles} good night. <D {Exit Suffolke}.>
2865   Well Sir, what followes?
2866   <D {Enter Sir Anthony Denny}.>
2867  *<S {Den}.> Sir, I haue brought my Lord the Arch- byshop,
2868   As you commanded me.
2869   <S {King}.> Ha? Canterbury?
2870   <S {Den}.> #I my good Lord.
2871   <S {King}.> 'Tis true: where is he {Denny}?
2872   <S {Den}.> He attends your Highnesse pleasure.
2873   <S {King}.> Bring him to Vs.
2874   <S {Lou}.> This is about that, which the Byshop spake,
2875   I am happily come hither.
2876   <D {Enter Cranmer and Denny}.>
2877   <S {King}.> Auoyd the Gallery.  <D {Louel seemes to stay}.>
2878   Ha? I haue said. Be gone.
2879   What?  <D {Exeunt Louell and Denny}.>
2880   <S {Cran}.> I am fearefull: Wherefore frownes he thus?
2881   'Tis his Aspect of Terror. All's not well.
2882   <S {King}.> How now my Lord?
2883   You do desire to know wherefore
2884   I sent for you.
2885   <S {Cran}.> It is my dutie
2886   T' attend your Highnesse pleasure.
2887   <S {King}.> Pray you arise
2888   My good and gracious Lord of Canterburie:
2889   Come, you and I must walke a turne together:
2890   I haue Newes to tell you.
2891   Come, come, giue me your hand.
2892   Ah my good Lord, I greeue at what I speake,
2893   And am right sorrie to repeat what followes.
2894   I haue, and most vnwillingly of late
      <P x2v>
2895   Heard many greeuous, I do say my Lord
2896   Greeuous complaints of you; which being consider'd,
2897   Haue mou'd Vs, and our Councell, that you shall
2898   This Morning come before vs, where I know
2899   You cannot with such freedome purge your selfe,
2900   But that till further Triall, in those Charges
2901   Which will require your Answer, you must take
2902   Your patience to you, and be well contented
2903   To make your house our Towre: you, a Brother of vs
2904   It fits we thus proceed, or else no witnesse
2905   Would come against you.
2906   <S {Cran}.> I humbly thanke your Highnesse,
2907   And am right glad to catch this good occasion
2908   Most throughly to be winnowed, where my Chaffe
2909   And Corne shall flye asunder. For I know
2910   There's none stands vnder more calumnious tongues,
2911   Then I my selfe, poore man.
2912   <S {King}.> Stand vp, good Canterbury,
2913   Thy Truth, and thy Integrity is rooted
2914   In vs thy Friend. Giue me thy hand, stand vp,
2915   Prythee let's walke. Now by my Holydame,
2916   What manner of man are you? My Lord, I look'd
2917   You would haue giuen me your Petition, that
2918   I should haue tane some paines, to bring together
2919   Your selfe, and your Accusers, and to haue heard you
2920   Without indurance further.
2921   <S {Cran}.> Most dread Liege,
2922   The good I stand on, is my Truth and Honestie:
2923   If they shall faile, I with mine Enemies
2924   Will triumph o're my person, which I waigh not,
2925   Being of those Vertues vacant. I feare nothing
2926   What can be said against me.
2927   <S {King}.> Know you not
2928  *How your state stands i'th' world, with the whole world?
2929   Your Enemies are many, and not small; their practises
2930   Must beare the same proportion, and not euer
2931   The Iustice and the Truth o'th' question carries
2932   The dew o'th' Verdict with it; at what ease
2933   Might corrupt mindes procure, Knaues as corrupt
2934   To sweare against you: Such things haue bene done.
2935   You are Potently oppos'd, and with a Malice
2936   Of as great Size. Weene you of better lucke,
2937   I meane in periur'd Witnesse, then your Master,
2938   Whose Minister you are, whiles heere he liu'd
2939   Vpon this naughty Earth? Go #too, go #too,
2940   You take a Precepit for no leape of danger,
2941   And woe your owne destruction.
2942   <S {Cran}.> God, and your Maiesty
2943   Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
2944   The trap is laid for me.
2945   <S {King}.> Be of good cheere,
2946   They shall no more preuaile, then we giue way #too:
2947   Keepe comfort to you, and this Morning see
2948   You do appeare before them. If they shall chance
2949   In charging you with matters, to commit you:
2950   The best perswasions to the contrary
2951   Faile not to vse, and with what vehemencie
2952   Th' occasion shall instruct you. If intreaties
2953   Will render you no remedy, this Ring
2954   Deliuer them, and your Appeale to vs
2955  *There make before them. Looke, the goodman weeps:
2956   He's honest on mine Honor. Gods blest Mother,
2957   I sweare he is true- hearted, and a soule
2958   None better in my Kingdome. Get you gone,
2959   And do as I haue bid you.  <D {Exit Cranmer}.>
2960   He ha's strangled his Language in his teares.
2961   <D {Enter Olde Lady}.>
2962   <S {Gent}. {within}.> Come backe: what meane you?
2963   <S {Lady}.> Ile not come backe, the tydings that I bring
2964   Will make my boldnesse, manners. Now good Angels
2965   Fly o're thy Royall head, and shade thy person
2966   Vnder their blessed wings.
2967   <S {King}.> Now by thy lookes
2968   I gesse thy Message. Is the Queene deliuer'd?
2969   Say #I, and of a boy.
2970   <S {Lady}.> #I, #I my Liege,
2971   And of a louely Boy: the God of heauen
2972   Both now, and euer blesse her: 'Tis a Gyrle
2973   Promises Boyes heereafter. Sir, your Queen
2974   Desires your Visitation, and to be
2975   Acquainted with this stranger; 'tis as like you,
2976   As Cherry, is to Cherry.
2977   <S {King}.> {Louell}.
2978   <S {Lou}.> Sir.
2979   <S {King}.> Giue her an hundred Markes.
2980   Ile to the Queene.  <D {Exit King}.>
2981  *<S {Lady}.> An hundred Markes? By this light, Ile #ha more.
2982   An ordinary Groome is for such payment.
2983   I will haue more, or scold it out of him.
2984   Said I for this, the Gyrle was like to him? Ile
2985   Haue more, or else vnsay't: and now, while 'tis hot,
2986   Ile put it to the issue.  <D {Exit Ladie}.>
      <A F>
2987   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2988   <D {Enter Cranmer, Archbyshop of Canterbury}.>
2989  *<S {Cran}.> I hope I am not too late, and yet the Gentleman
2990   That was sent to me from the Councell, pray'd me
2991   To make great #hast. All fast? What meanes this? Hoa?
2992   Who waites there? Sure you know me?
2993   <D {Enter Keeper}.>
2994   <S {Keep}.> Yes, my Lord:
2995   But yet I cannot helpe you.
2996   <S {Cran}.> Why?
2997   <S {Keep}.> Your Grace must waight till you be call'd for.
2998   <D {Enter Doctor Buts}.>
2999   <S {Cran}.> So.
3000   <S {Buts}.> This is a Peere of Malice: I am glad
3001   I came this way so happily. The King
3002   Shall vnderstand it presently.  <D {Exit Buts}>
3003   <S {Cran}.> 'Tis {Buts}.
3004   The Kings Physitian, as he past along
3005   How earnestly he cast his eyes vpon me:
3006   Pray heauen he found not my disgrace: for certaine
3007   This is of purpose laid by some that hate me,
3008   (God turne their hearts, I neuer sought their malice)
3009  *To quench mine Honor; they would shame to make me
3010   Wait else at doore: a fellow Councellor
3011   'Mong Boyes, Groomes, and Lackeyes.
3012   But their pleasures
3013   Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
3014   <D {Enter the King, and Buts, at a Windowe}
3015   {aboue}.>
3016   <S {Buts}.> Ile shew your Grace the strangest sight.
3017   <S {King}.> What's that {Buts}?
      <P x3><C I>
3018   <S {Butts}.> I thinke your Highnesse saw this many a day.
3019   <S {Kin}.> Body #a me: where is it?
3020   <S {Butts}.> There my Lord:
3021   The high promotion of his Grace of {Canterbury},
3022   Who holds his State at dore 'mongst Purseuants,
3023   Pages, and Foot- boyes.
3024   <S {Kin}.> Ha? 'Tis he indeed.
3025   Is this the Honour they doe one another?
3026   'Tis well there's one aboue 'em yet; I had thought
3027   They had parted so much honesty among 'em,
3028   At least good manners; as not thus to suffer
3029   A man of his Place, and so neere our fauour
3030   To dance attendance on their Lordships pleasures,
3031   And at the dore too, like a Post with Packets:
3032   By holy {Mary} ({Butts}) there's knauery;
3033   Let 'em alone, and draw the Curtaine close:
3034   We shall heare more anon.
3035  *<D {A Councell Table brought in with Chayres and Stooles, and}

3041   {Cromwell at lower end, as Secretary}.>
3042   <S {Chan}.> Speake to the businesse, M[aster]. Secretary;
3043   Why are we met in Councell?
3044   <S {Crom}.> Please your Honours,
3045   The chiefe cause concernes his Grace of {Canterbury}.
3046   <S {Gard}.> Ha's he had knowledge of it?
3047   <S {Crom}.> Yes.
3048   <S {Norf}.> Who waits there?
3049   <S {Keep}.> Without my Noble Lords?
3050   <S {Gard}.> Yes.
3051   <S {Keep}.> My Lord Archbishop:
3052   And ha's done halfe an houre to know your pleasures.
3053   <S {Chan}.> Let him come in.
3054   <S {Keep}.> Your Grace may enter now.
3055   <D {Cranmer approches the Councell Table}.>
3056   <S {Chan}.> My good Lord Archbishop, I'm very sorry
3057   To sit heere at this present, and behold
3058   That Chayre stand empty: But we all are men
3059   In our owne natures fraile, and capable
3060   Of our flesh, few are Angels; out of which frailty
3061   And want of wisedome, you that best should teach vs,
3062   Haue misdemean'd your selfe, and not a little:
3063   Toward the King first, then his Lawes, in filling
3064  *The whole Realme, by your teaching & your Chaplaines
3065   (For so we are inform'd) with new opinions,
3066   Diuers and dangerous; which are Heresies;
3067   And not reform'd, may proue pernicious.
3068   <S {Gard}.> Which Reformation must be sodaine too
3069   My Noble Lords; for those that tame wild Horses,
3070   Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle;
3071  *But stop their mouthes with stubborn Bits & spurre 'em,
3072   Till they obey the mannage. If we suffer
3073   Out of our easinesse and childish pitty
3074   To one mans Honour, this contagious sicknesse;
3075   Farewell all Physicke: and what followes then?
3076   Commotions, vprores, with a generall Taint
3077   Of the whole State; as of late dayes our neighbours,
3078   The vpper {Germany} can deerely witnesse:
3079   Yet freshly pittied in our memories.
3080  *<S {Cran}.> My good Lords; Hitherto, in all the Progresse
3081   Both of my Life and Office, I haue labour'd,
3082   And with no little study, that my teaching
3083   And the strong course of my Authority,
3084   Might goe one way, and safely; and the end
3085   Was euer to doe well: nor is there liuing,
3086   (I speake it with a single heart, my Lords)
3087   A man that more detests, more stirres against,
3088   Both in his priuate Conscience, and his place,
3089   Defacers of a publique peace then I doe:
3090   Pray Heauen the King may neuer find a heart
3091   With lesse Allegeance in it. Men that make
3092   Enuy, and crooked malice, nourishment;
3093   Dare bite the best. I doe beseech your, Lordships,
3094   That in this case of Iustice, my Accusers,
3095   Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
3096   And freely vrge against me.
3097   <S {Suff}.> Nay, my Lord,
3098   That cannot be; you are a Counsellor,
3099   And by that vertue no man dare accuse you.
3100  *<S {Gard}.> My Lord, because we haue busines of more mo-|(ment,
3101  *We will be short with you. 'Tis his Highnesse pleasure
3102   And our consent, for better tryall of you,
3103   From hence you be committed to the Tower,
3104   Where being but a priuate man againe,
3105   You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
3106   More then (I feare) you are prouided for.
3107  *<S {Cran}.> Ah my good Lord of {Winchester}: I thanke you,
3108   You are alwayes my good Friend, if your #will passe,
3109   I shall both finde your Lordship, Iudge and Iuror,
3110   You are so mercifull. I see your end,
3111   'Tis my vndoing. Loue and meekenesse, Lord
3112   Become a Churchman, better then Ambition:
3113   Win straying Soules with modesty againe,
3114   Cast none away: That I shall cleere my selfe,
3115   Lay all the weight ye can vpon my patience,
3116   I make as little doubt as you doe conscience,
3117   In doing dayly wrongs. I could say more,
3118   But reuerence to your calling, makes me modest.
3119   <S {Gard}.> My Lord, my Lord, you are a Sectary,
3120   That's the plaine truth; your painted glosse discouers
3121   To men that vnderstand you, words and weaknesse.
3122   <S {Crom}.> My Lord of {Winchester}, y'are a little,
3123   By your good fauour, too sharpe; Men so Noble,
3124   How euer faulty, yet should finde respect
3125   For what they haue beene: 'tis a cruelty,
3126   To load a falling man.
3127   <S {Gard}.> Good M[aster]. Secretary,
3128   I cry your Honour mercie; you may worst
3129   Of all this Table say so.
3130   <S {Crom}.> Why my Lord?
3131   <S {Gard}.> Doe not I know you for a Fauourer
3132   Of this new Sect? ye are not sound.
3133   <S {Crom}.> Not sound?
3134   <S {Gard}.> Not sound I say.
3135   <S {Crom}.> Would you were halfe so honest:
3136   Mens prayers then would seeke you, not their feares.
3137   <S {Gard}.> I shall remember this bold Language.
3138   <S {Crom}.> Doe.
3139   Remember your bold life too.
3140   <S {Cham}.> This is too much;
3141   Forbeare for shame my Lords.
3142   <S {Gard}.> I haue done.
3143   <S {Crom}.> And I.
3144  *<S {Cham}.> Then thus for you my Lord, it stands agreed
3145   I take it, by all voyces: That forthwith,
3146   You be conuaid to th' Tower a Prisoner;
3147   There to remaine till the Kings further pleasure
3148   Be knowne vnto vs: are you all agreed Lords.
      <P x3v>
3149   <S {All}.> We are.
3150   <S {Cran}.> Is there no other way of mercy,
3151   But I must needs to th' Tower my Lords?
3152   <S {Gard}.> What other,
3153   Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome:
3154   Let some o'th' Guard be ready there.
3155   <D {Enter the Guard}.>
3156   <S {Cran}.> For me?
3157   Must I goe like a Traytor thither?
3158   <S {Gard}.> Receiue him,
3159   And see him safe i'th' Tower.
3160   <S {Cran}.> Stay good my Lords,
3161   I haue a little yet to say. Looke there my Lords,
3162   By vertue of that Ring, I take my cause
3163   Out of the gripes of cruell men, and giue it
3164   To a most Noble Iudge, the King my Maister.
3165   <S {Cham}.> This is the Kings Ring.
3166   <S {Sur}.> 'Tis no counterfeit.
3167   <S {Suff}.> 'Ts the right Ring, by Heau'n: I told ye all,
3168   When we first put this dangerous stone #a rowling,
3169   'Twold fall vpon our selues.
3170   <S {Norf}.> Doe you thinke my Lords
3171   The King will suffer but the little finger
3172   Of this man to be vex'd?
3173   <S {Cham}.> Tis now too certaine;
3174   How much more is his Life in value with him?
3175   Would I were fairely out on't.
3176   <S {Crom}.> My mind gaue me,
3177   In seeking tales and Informations
3178   Against this man, whose honesty the Diuell
3179   And his Disciples onely enuy at,
3180   Ye blew the fire that burnes ye: now haue at ye.
3181   <D {Enter King frowning on them, takes his Seate}.>
3182   <S {Gard}.> Dread Soueraigne,
3183   How much are we bound to Heauen,
3184   In dayly thankes, that gaue vs such a Prince;
3185   Not onely good and wise, but most religious:
3186   One that in all obedience, makes the Church
3187   The cheefe ayme of his Honour, and to strengthen
3188   That holy duty out of deare respect,
3189   His Royall selfe in Iudgement comes to heare
3190   The cause betwixt her, and this great offender.
3191  *<S {Kin}.> You were euer good at sodaine Commendations,
3192   Bishop of {Winchester}. But know I come not
3193   To heare such flattery now, and in my presence
3194   They are too thin, and base to hide offences,
3195   To me you cannot reach. You play the Spaniell,
3196   And thinke with wagging of your tongue to win me:
3197   But whatsoere thou tak'st me for; I'm sure
3198   Thou hast a cruell Nature and a bloody.
3199   Good man sit downe: Now let me see the proudest
3200   #Hee, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.
3201   By all that's holy, he had better starue,
3202   Then but once thinke his place becomes thee not.
3203   <S {Sur}.> May it please your Grace; ===
3204   <S {Kin}.> No Sir, it doe's not please me,
3205   I had thought, I had had men of some vnderstanding,
3206   And wisedome of my Councell; but I finde none:
3207   Was it discretion Lords, to let this man,
3208   This good man (few of you deserue that Title)
3209   This honest man, wait like a lowsie Foot- boy
3210   At Chamber dore? and one, as great as you are?
3211   Why, what a shame was this? Did my Commission
3212   Bid ye so farre forget your selues? I gaue ye
3213   Power, as he was a Counsellour to try him,
3214   Not as a Groome: There's some of ye, I see,
3215   More out of Malice then Integrity,
3216   Would trye him to the vtmost, had ye meane,
3217   Which ye shall neuer haue while I liue.
3218   <S {Chan}.> Thus farre
3219   My most dread Soueraigne, may it like your Grace,
3220   To let my tongue excuse all. What was purpos'd
3221   Concerning his Imprisonment, was rather
3222   (If there be faith in men) meant for his Tryall,
3223   And faire purgation to the world then malice,
3224   I'm sure in me.
3225   <S {Kin}.> Well, well my Lords respect him,
3226   Take him, and vse him well; hee's worthy of it.
3227   I will say thus much for him, if a Prince
3228   May be beholding to a Subiect; I
3229   Am for his loue and seruice, so to him.
3230   Make me no more adoe, but all embrace him;
3231  *Be friends for shame my Lords: My Lord of {Canterbury}
3232   I haue a Suite which you must not deny mee.
3233   That is, a faire young Maid that yet wants Baptisme,
3234   You must be Godfather, and answere for her.
3235   <S {Cran}.> The greatest Monarch now aliue may glory
3236   In such an honour: how may I deserue it,
3237   That am a poore and humble Subiect to you?
3238  *<S {Kin}.> Come, come my Lord, you'd spare your spoones;
3239  *You shall haue two noble Partners with you: the old
3240  *Duchesse of {Norfolke}, and Lady Marquesse {Dorset}? will
3241   these please you?
3242   Once more my Lord of {Winchester}, I charge you
3243   Embrace, and loue this man.
3244   <S {Gard}.> With a true heart,
3245   And Brother; loue I doe it.
3246   <S {Cran}.> And let Heauen
3247   Witnesse how deare, I hold this Confirmation.
3248  *<S {Kin}.> Good Man, those ioyfull teares shew thy true |(hearts,
3249   The common voyce I see is verified
3250  *Of thee, which sayes thus: Doe my Lord of {Canterbury}
3251   A shrewd turne, and hee's your friend for euer:
3252   Come Lords, we trifle time away: I long
3253   To haue this young one made a Christian.
3254   As I haue made ye one Lords, one remaine:
3255   So I grow stronger, you more Honour gaine.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3256   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
3257   <D {Noyse and Tumult within: Enter Porter and}
3258   {his man}.>
3259  *<S {Port}.> You'l leaue your noyse anon ye Rascals: doe
3260  *you take the Court for Parish Garden: ye rude Slaues,
3261   leaue your gaping.
3262   <S {Within}.> Good M[aster]. Porter I belong to th' Larder.
3263  *<S {Port}.> Belong to th' Gallowes, and be hang'd ye Rogue:
3264  *Is this a place to roare in? Fetch me a dozen Crab- tree
3265  *staues, and strong ones; these are but switches to 'em:
3266  *Ile scratch your heads; you must be seeing Christenings?
3267  *Do you looke for Ale, and Cakes heere, you rude
3268   Raskalls?
3269   <S {Man}.> Pray Sir be patient; 'tis as much impossible,
3270   Vnlesse wee sweepe 'em from the dore with Cannons,
3271   To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleepe
3272   On May- day Morning, which will neuer be:
3273   We may as well push against Powles as stirre 'em.
3274   <S {Por}.> How got they in, and be hang'd?
      <P x4>
3275   <S {Man}.> Alas I know not, how gets the Tide in?
3276   As much as one sound Cudgell of foure foote,
3277   (You see the poore remainder) could distribute,
3278   I made no spare Sir.
3279   <S {Port}.> You did nothing Sir.
3280   <S {Man}.> I am not {Sampson}, nor Sir {Guy}, nor {Colebrand},
3281   To mow 'em downe before me: but if I spar'd any
3282   That had a head to hit, either young or old,
3283   He or shee, Cuckold or Cuckold- maker:
3284   Let me ne're hope to see a Chine againe,
3285   And that I would not for a Cow, God saue her.
3286   <S {Within}.> Do you heare M[aster]. Porter?
3287  *<S {Port}.> I shall be with you presently, good M[aster]. {Puppy},
3288   Keepe the dore close Sirha.
3289   <S {Man}.> What would you haue me doe?
3290   <S {Por}.> What should you doe,
3291  *But knock 'em downe by th' dozens? Is this More fields
3292  *to muster in? Or haue wee some strange Indian with the
3293  *great {Toole}, come to Court, the women so besiege vs?
3294  *Bless me, what a fry of Fornication is at dore? On my
3295  *Christian Conscience this one Christening will beget a
3296  *thousand, here will bee Father, God- father, and all to-gether.
3297  _
3298  *<S {Man}.> The Spoones will be the bigger Sir: There is
3299  *a fellow somewhat neere the doore, he should be a Brasi-er
3300  *by his face, for #o' my conscience twenty of the Dog-dayes
3301  *now reigne in's Nose; all that stand about him are
3302  *vnder the Line, they need no other pennance: that Fire-Drake
3303  *did I hit three times on the head, and three times
3304  *was his Nose discharged against mee; hee stands there
3305  *like a Morter- piece to blow vs. There was a Habberda-shers
3306  *Wife of small wit, neere him, that rail'd vpon me,
3307  *till her pinck'd porrenger fell off her head, for kindling
3308  *such a combustion in the State. I mist the Meteor once,
3309  *and hit that Woman, who cryed out Clubbes, when I
3310  *might see from farre, some forty Truncheoners draw to
3311  *her succour, which were the hope o'th' Strond where she
3312  *was quartered; they fell on, I made good my place; at
3313  *length they came to th' broome staffe to me, I defide 'em
3314  *stil, when sodainly a File of Boyes behind 'em, loose shot,
3315  *deliuer'd such a showre of Pibbles, that I was faine to
3316  *draw mine Honour in, and let 'em win the Worke, the
3317   Diuell was amongst 'em I thinke surely.
3318  *<S {Por}.> These are the youths that thunder at a Playhouse,
3319  *and fight for bitten Apples, that no Audience but the
3320  *tribulation of Tower Hill, or the Limbes of Limehouse,
3321  *their deare Brothers are able to endure. I haue some of
3322  *'em in {Limbo Patrum}, and there they are like to dance
3323  *these three dayes; besides the running Banquet of two
3324   Beadles, that is to come.
3325   <D {Enter Lord Chamberlaine}.>
3326   <S {Cham}.> Mercy #o' me: what a Multitude are heere?
3327   They grow still too; from all Parts they are comming,
3328   As if we kept a Faire heere? Where are these Porters?
3329   These lazy knaues? Y'haue made a fine hand fellowes?
3330   Theres a trim rabble let in: are all these
3331   Your faithfull friends o'th' Suburbs? We shall haue
3332   Great store of roome no doubt, left for the Ladies,
3333   When they passe backe from the Christening?
3334   <S {Por}.> And't please your Honour,
3335   We are but men; and what so many may doe,
3336   Not being torne #a pieces, we haue done:
3337   An Army cannot rule 'em.
3338   <S {Cham}.> As I liue,
3339   If the King blame me for't; Ile lay ye all
3340   By th' heeles, and sodainly: and on your heads
3341   Clap round Fines for neglect: y'are lazy knaues,
3342   And heere ye lye baiting of Bombards, when
3343   Ye should doe Seruice. Harke the Trumpets sound,
3344   Th'are come already from the Christening,
3345   Go breake among the preasse, and finde away out
3346   To let the Troope passe fairely; or Ile finde
3347   A Marshallsey, shall hold ye play these two Monthes.
3348   <S {Por}.> Make way there, for the Princesse.

3377   <S {Kin}.> Stand vp Lord,

3379   Into whose hand, I giue thy Life.
3380   <S {Cran}.> {Amen}.
3381  *<S {Kin}.> My Noble Gossips, y'haue beene too Prodigall;
3382   I thanke ye heartily: So shall this Lady,

3384   <S {Cran}.> Let me speake Sir,
3385   For Heauen now bids me; and the words I vtter,
3386   Let none thinke Flattery; for they'l finde 'em Truth.
3387   This Royall Infant, Heauen still moue about her;
3388   Though in her Cradle; yet now promises
3389   Vpon this Land a thousand thousand Blessings,
3390   Which Time shall bring to ripenesse: She shall be,
3391   (But few now liuing can behold that goodnesse)
3392   A Patterne to all Princes liuing with her,
3393   And all that shall succeed: {Saba} was neuer
3394   More couetous of Wisedome, and faire Vertue
3395   Then this pure Soule shall be. All Princely Graces
3396   That mould vp such a mighty Piece as this is,
3397   With all the Vertues that attend the good,
3398   Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall Nurse her,
      <P x4v>
3399   Holy and Heauenly thoughts still Counsell her:
3400   She shall be lou'd and fear'd. Her owne shall blesse her;
3401   Her Foes shake like a Field of beaten Corne,
3402   And hang their heads with sorrow:
3403   Good growes with her.
3404   In her dayes, Euery Man shall eate in safety,
3405   Vnder his owne Vine what he plants; and sing
3406   The merry Songs of Peace to all his Neighbours.
3407   God shall be truely knowne, and those about her,
3408   From her shall read the perfect way of Honour,
3409   And by those claime their greatnesse; not by Blood.
3410   Nor shall this peace sleepe with her: But as when
3411   The Bird of Wonder dyes, the Mayden Phoenix,
3412   Her Ashes new create another Heyre,
3413   As great in admiration as her selfe.
3414   So shall she  leaue her Blessednesse to One,
3415  *(When Heauen shal call her from this clowd of darknes)
3416   Who, from the sacred Ashes of her Honour
3417   Shall Star- like rise, as great in fame as she was,
3418   And so stand fix'd. Peace, Plenty, Loue, Truth, Terror,
3419   That were the Seruants to this chosen Infant,
3420   Shall then be his, and like a Vine grow to him;
3421   Where euer the bright Sunne of Heauen shall shine,
3422   His Honour, and the greatnesse of his Name,
3423   Shall be, and make new Nations. He shall flourish,
3424   And like a Mountaine Cedar, reach his branches,
3425  *To all the Plaines about him: Our Childrens Children
3426   Shall see this, and blesse Heauen.
3427   <S {Kin}.> Thou speakest wonders.
3428   <S {Cran}.> She shall be to the happinesse of England,
3429   An aged Princesse; many dayes shall see her,
3430   And yet no day without a deed to Crowne it.
3431   Would I had knowne no more: But she must dye,
3432   She must, the Saints must haue her; yet a Virgin,
3433   A most vnspotted Lilly shall she passe
3434   To th' ground, and all the World shall mourne her.
3435   <S {Kin}.> O Lord Archbishop
3436   Thou hast made me now a man, neuer before
3437   This happy Child, did I get any thing.
3438   This Oracle of comfort, ha's so pleas'd me,
3439   That when I am in Heauen, I shall desire
3440   To see what this Child does, and praise my Maker.
3441   I thanke ye all. To you my good Lord Maior,
3442   And you good Brethren, I am much beholding:
3443   I haue receiu'd much Honour by your presence,
3444   And ye shall find me thankfull. Lead the way Lords,
3445   Ye must all see the Queene, and she must thanke ye,
3446   She will be sicke els. This day, no man thinke
3447    'Has businesse at his house; for all shall stay:
