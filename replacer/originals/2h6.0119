8      As by your high Imperiall Maiesty,
9      I had in charge at my depart for France,
10     As Procurator to your Excellence,
11     To marry Princes {Margaret} for your Grace;
12     So in the Famous Ancient City, {Toures},
13     In presence of the Kings of {France}, and {Sicill},
14    *The Dukes of {Orleance, Calaber, Britaigne}, and {Alanson},
15    *Seuen Earles, twelue Barons, & twenty reuerend Bishops
16     I haue perform'd my Taske, and was espous'd,
17     And humbly now vpon my bended knee,
18     In sight of England, and her Lordly Peeres,
19     Deliuer vp my Title in the Queene
20     To your most gracious hands, that are the Substance
21     Of that great Shadow I did represent:
22     The happiest Gift, that euer Marquesse gaue,
23     The Fairest Queene, that euer King receiu'd.
24     <S {King}.> Suffolke arise. Welcome Queene {Margaret},
25     I can expresse no kinder signe of Loue
26     Then this kinde kisse: O Lord, that lends me life,
27     Lend me a heart repleate with thankfulnesse:
28     For thou hast giuen me in this beauteous Face
29     A world of earthly blessings to my soule,
30     If Simpathy of Loue vnite our thoughts.
31    *<S {Queen}.> Great King of England, & my gracious Lord,
32     The mutuall conference that my minde hath had,
33     By day, by night; waking, and in my dreames,
34     In Courtly company, or at my Beades,
35     With you mine {Alder liefest} Soueraigne,
36     Makes me the bolder to salute my King,
37     With ruder termes, such as my wit affoords,
38     And ouer ioy of heart doth minister.
39     <S {King}.> Her sight did rauish, but her grace in Speech,
40     Her words yclad with wisedomes Maiesty,
41     Makes me from Wondring, fall to Weeping ioyes,
42     Such is the Fulnesse of my hearts content.
43     Lords, with one cheerefull voice, Welcome my Loue.
44    *<S {#All kneel}.> Long liue Qu[eene]. {Margaret}, Englands happines.
45     <S {Queene}.> We thanke you all.  <D {Florish}>
46     <S {Suf}.> My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
47     Heere are the Articles of contracted peace,
48    *Betweene our Soueraigne, and the French King {Charles},
49     For eighteene moneths concluded by consent.
50    *<S {Glo}. {Reads}.> Inprimis, {It is agreed betweene the French K[ing]}.
51    *{Charles, and William de la Pole Marquesse of Suffolke, Am-bassador}

56    *Item, {That the Dutchy of Aniou, and the County of Main},
57     {shall be released and deliuered to the King her father}.
58     <S {King}.> Vnkle, how now?
59     <S {Glo}.> Pardon me gracious Lord,
60     Some sodaine qualme hath strucke me at the heart,
61     And dim'd mine eyes, that I can reade no further.
62     <S {King}.> Vnckle of Winchester, I pray read on.
63    *<S {Win}.> Item, {It is further agreed betweene them, That the}

69     We heere create thee the first Duke of Suffolke,
70     And girt thee with the Sword. Cosin of Yorke,
71     We heere discharge your Grace from being Regent
72     I'th parts of France, till terme of eighteene Moneths
73     Be full expyr'd. Thankes Vncle Winchester,
74     Gloster, Yorke, Buckingham, Somerset,
75     Salisburie, and Warwicke.
76     We thanke you all for this great fauour done,
77     In entertainment to my Princely Queene.
78     Come, let vs in, and with all speede prouide
79     To see her Coronation be perform'd.
80     <D {Exit King, Queene, and Suffolke}.>
81     <D {Manet the rest}.>
82     <S {Glo}.> Braue Peeres of England, Pillars of the State,
83     To you Duke {Humfrey} must vnload his greefe:
84     Your greefe, the common greefe of all the Land.
85     What? did my brother {Henry} spend his youth,
86     His valour, coine, and people in the warres?
87     Did he so often lodge in open field:
88     In Winters cold, and Summers parching heate,
89     To conquer France, his true inheritance?
90     And did my brother {Bedford} toyle his wits,
      <P m3>
91     To keepe by policy what {Henrie} got:
92     Haue you your selues, {Somerset}, {Buckingham},
93     Braue {Yorke}, {Salisbury}, and victorious {Warwicke},
94     Receiud deepe scarres in France and Normandie:
95     Or hath mine Vnckle {Beauford}, and my selfe,
96     With all the Learned Counsell of the Realme,
97     Studied so long, sat in the Councell house,
98     Early and late, debating #too and fro
99     How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
100    And hath his Highnesse in his infancie,
101    Crowned in Paris in despight of foes,
102    And shall these Labours, and these Honours dye?
103    Shall {Henries} Conquest, {Bedfords} vigilance,
104    Your Deeds of Warre, and all our Counsell dye?
105    O Peeres of England, shamefull is this League,
106    Fatall this Marriage, cancelling your Fame,
107    Blotting your names from Bookes of memory,
108    Racing the Charracters of your Renowne,
109    Defacing Monuments of Conquer'd France,
110    Vndoing all as all had neuer bin.
111   *<S {Car}.> Nephew, what meanes this passionate discourse?
112    This preroration with such circumstance:
113    For France, 'tis ours; and we will keepe it still.
114    <S {Glo}.> #I Vnckle, we will keepe it, if we can:
115    But now it is impossible we should.
116    Suffolke, the new made Duke that rules the rost,
117    Hath giuen the Dutchy of {Aniou} and {Mayne},
118    Vnto the poore King {Reignier}, whose large style
119    Agrees not with the leannesse of his purse.
120    <S {Sal}.> Now by the death of him that dyed for all,
121    These Counties were the Keyes of {Normandie}:
122    But wherefore weepes {Warwicke}, my valiant sonne?
123    <S {War}.> For greefe that they are past recouerie.
124    For were there hope to conquer them againe,
125    My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no teares.
126    {Aniou} and {Maine}? My selfe did win them both:
127    Those Prouinces, these Armes of mine did conquer,
128    And are the Citties that I got with wounds,
129    Deliuer'd vp againe with peacefull words?
130    {Mort Dieu}.
131    <S {Yorke}.> For Suffolkes Duke, may he be suffocate,
132    That dims the Honor of this Warlike Isle:
133    France should haue torne and rent my very hart,
134    Before I would haue yeelded to this League.
135    I neuer read but Englands Kings haue had
136    Large summes of Gold, and Dowries with their wiues,
137    And our King {Henry} giues away his owne,
138    To match with her that brings no vantages.
139    <S {Hum}.> A proper iest, and neuer heard before,
140    That Suffolke should demand a whole Fifteenth,
141    For Costs and Charges in transporting her:
142    She should haue staid in France, and steru'd in France
143    Before ===
144    <S {Car}.> My Lord of Gloster, now ye grow too hot,
145    It was the pleasure of my Lord the King.
146    <S {Hum}.> My Lord of Winchester I know your minde.
147    'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike:
148    But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye,
149    Rancour will out, proud Prelate, in thy face
150    I see thy furie: If I longer stay,
151    We shall begin our ancient bickerings:
152    Lordings farewell, and say when I am gone,
153    I prophesied, France will be lost ere long.  <D {Exit Humfrey}.>
154    <S {Car}.> So, there goes our Protector in a rage:
155    'Tis knowne to you he is mine enemy:
156    Nay more, an enemy vnto you all,
157    And no great friend, I feare me to the King;
158    Consider Lords, he is the next of blood,
159    And heyre apparant to the English Crowne:
160    Had {Henrie} got an Empire by his marriage,
161    And all the wealthy Kingdomes of the West,
162    There's reason he should be displeas'd at it:
163    Looke to it Lords, let not his smoothing words
164    Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect.
165    What though the common people fauour him,
166    Calling him, {Humfrey the good Duke of Gloster},
167    Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voyce,
168    Iesu maintaine your Royall Excellence,
169    With God preserue the good Duke {Humfrey}:
170    I feare me Lords, for all this flattering glosse,
171    He will be found a dangerous Protector.
172    <S {Buc}.> Why should he then protect our Soueraigne?
173    He being of age to gouerne of himselfe.
174    Cosin of Somerset, ioyne you with me,
175    And altogether with the Duke of Suffolke,
176    Wee'l quickly hoyse Duke {Humfrey} from his seat.
177    <S {Car}.> This weighty businesse will not brooke delay,
178    Ile to the Duke of Suffolke presently.  <D {Exit Cardinall}.>
179    <S {Som}.> Cosin of Buckingham, though {Humfries} pride
180    And greatnesse of his place be greefe to vs,
181    Yet let vs watch the haughtie Cardinall,
182    His insolence is more intollerable
183    Then all the Princes in the Land beside,
184    If Gloster be displac'd, hee'l be Protector.
185    <S {Buc}.> Or thou, or I Somerset will be Protectors,
186    Despite Duke {Humfrey}, or the Cardinall.
187    <D {Exit Buckingham, and Somerset}.>
188    <S {Sal}.> Pride went before, Ambition followes him.
189    While these do labour for their owne preferment,
190    Behooues it vs to labor for the Realme.
191    I neuer saw but Humfrey Duke of Gloster,
192    Did beare him like a Noble Gentleman:
193    Oft haue I seene the haughty Cardinall,
194    More like a Souldier then a man o'th' Church,
195    As stout and proud as he were Lord of all,
196    Sweare like a Ruffian, and demeane himselfe
197    Vnlike the Ruler of a Common- weale.
198    Warwicke my sonne, the comfort of my age,
199    Thy deeds, thy plainnesse, and thy house- keeping,
200    Hath wonne the greatest fauour of the Commons,
201    Excepting none but good Duke Humfrey.
202    And Brother Yorke, thy Acts in Ireland,
203    In bringing them to ciuill Discipline:
204    Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
205    When thou wert Regent for our Soueraigne,
206    Haue made thee fear'd and honor'd of the people,
207    Ioyne we together for the publike good,
208    In what we can, to bridle and suppresse
209    The pride of Suffolke, and the Cardinall,
210    With Somersets and Buckinghams Ambition,
211    And as we may, cherish Duke Humfries deeds,
212    While they do tend the profit of the Land.
213   *<S {War}.> So God helpe Warwicke, as he loues the Land,
214    And common profit of his Countrey.
215    <S {Yor}.> And so sayes Yorke,
216    For he hath greatest cause.
217    <S {Salisbury}.> Then lets make #hast away,
218    And looke vnto the maine.
219    <S {Warwicke}.> Vnto the maine?
220    Oh Father, {Maine} is lost,
221   *That {Maine}, which by maine force Warwicke did winne,
222    And would haue kept, so long as breath did last:
      <P m3v>
223    Main- chance father you meant, but I meant {Maine},
224    Which I will win from France, or else be slaine.
225    <D {Exit Warwicke, and Salisbury. Manet Yorke}.>
226    <S {Yorke}.> {Aniou} and {Maine} are giuen to the French,
227    {Paris} is lost, the state of {Normandie}
228    Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
229    Suffolke concluded on the Articles,
230    The Peeres agreed, and {Henry} was well pleas'd,
231   *To change two Dukedomes for a Dukes faire daughter.
232    I cannot blame them all, what is't to them?
233    'Tis thine they giue away, and not their owne.
234    Pirates may make cheape penyworths of their pillage,
235    And purchase Friends, and giue to Curtezans,
236    Still reuelling like Lords till all be gone,
237    While as the silly Owner of the goods
238    Weepes ouer them, and wrings his haplesse hands,
239    And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloofe,
240    While all is shar'd, and all is borne away,
241    Ready to sterue, and dare not touch his owne.
242    So Yorke must sit, and fret, and bite his tongue,
243    While his owne Lands are bargain'd for, and sold:
244    Me thinkes the Realmes of England, France, & Ireland,
245    Beare that proportion to my flesh and blood,
246    As did the fatall brand {Althaea} burnt,
247    Vnto the Princes heart of {Calidon}:
248    {Aniou} and {Maine} both giuen vnto the French?
249    Cold newes for me: for I had hope of France,
250    Euen as I haue of fertile Englands soile.
251    A day will come, when Yorke shall claime his owne,
252    And therefore I will take the {Neuils} parts,
253    And make a shew of loue to proud Duke {Humfrey},
254    And when I spy aduantage, claime the Crowne,
255    For that's the Golden marke I seeke to hit:
256    Nor shall proud Lancaster vsurpe my right,
257    Nor hold the Scepter in his childish Fist,
258    Nor weare the Diadem vpon his head,
259    Whose Church- like humors fits not for a Crowne.
260    Then Yorke be still a- while, till time do serue:
261    Watch thou, and wake when others be asleepe,
262    To prie into the secrets of the State,
263    Till {Henrie} surfetting in ioyes of loue,
264   *With his new Bride, & Englands deere bought Queen,
265    And {Humfrey} with the Peeres be falne at iarres:
266    Then will I raise aloft the Milke- white- Rose,
267    With whose sweet smell the Ayre shall be perfum'd,
268    And   in my Standard beare the Armes of Yorke,
269    To grapple with the house of Lancaster,
270    And force perforce Ile make him yeeld the Crowne,
271    Whose bookish Rule, hath pull'd faire England downe.
272    <D {Exit Yorke}.>
273    <D {Enter Duke Humfrey and his wife Elianor}.>
274   *<S {Elia}.> Why droopes my Lord like ouer- ripen'd Corn,
275    Hanging the head at Ceres plenteous load?
276    Why doth the Great Duke {Humfrey} knit his browes,
277    As frowning at the Fauours of the world?
278    Why are thine eyes fixt to the sullen earth,
279    Gazing on that which seemes to dimme thy sight?
280    What seest thou there? King {Henries} Diadem,
281    Inchac'd with all the Honors of the world?
282    If so, Gaze on, and grouell on thy face,
283    Vntill thy head be circled with the same.
284    Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious Gold.
285    What, is't too short? Ile lengthen it with mine,
286    And hauing both together heau'd it vp,
287    Wee'l both together lift our heads to heauen,
288    And neuer more abase our sight so low,
289    As to vouchsafe one glance vnto the ground.
290   *<S {Hum}.> O {Nell}, sweet {Nell}, if thou dost loue thy Lord,
291    Banish the Canker of ambitious thoughts:
292    And may that thought, when I imagine #ill
293    Against my King and Nephew, vertuous {Henry},
294    Be my last breathing in this mortall world.
295    My troublous dreames this night, doth make me sad.
296   *<S {Eli}.> What dream'd my Lord, tell me, and Ile requite it
297    With sweet rehearsall of my mornings dreame?
298   *<S {Hum}.> Me thought this staffe mine Office- badge in
299    Court
300    Was broke in twaine: by whom, I haue forgot,
301    But as I thinke, it was by'th Cardinall,
302    And on the peeces of the broken Wand
303    Were plac'd the heads of {Edmond} Duke of Somerset,
304    And {William de la Pole} first Duke of Suffolke.
305    This was my dreame, what it doth bode God knowes.
306    <S {Eli}.> Tut, this was nothing but an argument,
307    That he that breakes a sticke of Glosters groue,
308    Shall loose his head for his presumption.
309    But list to me my {Humfrey}, my sweete Duke:
310    Me thought I sate in Seate of Maiesty,
311    In the Cathedrall Church of Westminster,
312   *And in that Chaire where Kings & Queens wer crownd,
313    Where {Henrie} and Dame {Margaret} kneel'd to me,
314    And on my head did set the Diadem.
315    <S {Hum}.> Nay {Elinor}, then must I chide outright:
316    Presumptuous Dame, ill- nurter'd {Elianor},
317    Art thou not second Woman in the Realme?
318    And the Protectors wife belou'd of him?
319    Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
320    Aboue the reach or compasse of thy thought?
321    And wilt thou still be hammering Treachery,
322    To tumble downe thy husband, and thy selfe,
323    From top of Honor, to Disgraces feete?
324    Away from me, and let me heare no more.
325    <S {Elia}.> What, what, my Lord? Are you so chollericke
326    With {Elianor}, for telling but her dreame?
327    Next time Ile keepe my dreames vnto my selfe,
328    And not be check'd.
329    <S {Hum}.> Nay be not angry, I am pleas'd againe.
330    <D {Enter Messenger}.>
331   *<S {Mess}.> My Lord Protector, 'tis his Highnes pleasure,
332    You do prepare to ride vnto S[aint]. {Albons},
333    Where as the King and Queene do meane to Hawke.
334   *<S {Hu}.> I go. Come {Nel} thou wilt ride with vs?  <D {Ex[it]. Hum[frey]}>
335    <S {Eli}.> Yes my good Lord, Ile follow presently.
336    Follow I must, I cannot go before,
337    While Gloster beares this base and humble minde.
338    Were I a Man, a Duke, and next of blood,
339    I would remoue these tedious stumbling blockes,
340    And smooth my way vpon their headlesse neckes.
341    And being a woman, I will not be slacke
342    To play my part in Fortunes Pageant.
343    Where are you there? Sir {Iohn}; nay feare not man,
344    We are alone, here's none but thee, & I.  <D {Enter Hume}.>
345    <S {Hume}.> Iesus preserue your Royall Maiesty.
346    <S {Elia}.> What saist thou? Maiesty: I am but Grace.
347    <S {Hume}.> But by the grace of God, and {Humes} aduice,
348    Your Graces Title shall be multiplied.
349    <S {Elia}.> What saist thou man? Hast thou as yet confer'd
350    With {Margerie Iordane} the cunning Witch,
351    With {Roger Bollingbrooke} the Coniurer?
352    And will they vndertake to do me good?
353   *<S {Hume}.> This they haue promised to shew your Highnes
354    A Spirit rais'd from depth of vnder ground,
      <P m4><C A>
355    That shall make answere to such Questions,
356    As by your Grace shall be propounded him.
357    <S {Elianor}.> It is enough, Ile thinke vpon the Questions:
358    When from Saint {Albones} we doe make returne,
359    Wee'le see these things effected to the full.
360    Here {Hume}, take this reward, make merry man
361    With thy Confederates in this weightie cause.
362    <D {Exit Elianor}.>
363   *<S {Hume}.> {Hume} must make merry with the Duchesse Gold:
364    Marry and shall: but how now, Sir {Iohn Hume}?
365    Seale vp your Lips, and giue no words but Mum,
366    The businesse asketh silent secrecie.
367    Dame {Elianor} giues Gold, to bring the Witch:
368    Gold cannot come amisse, were she a Deuill.
369    Yet haue I Gold flyes from another Coast:
370    I dare not say, from the rich Cardinall,
371    And from the great and new- made Duke of Suffolke;
372    Yet I doe finde it so: for to be plaine,
373    They (knowing Dame {Elianors} aspiring humor)
374    Haue hyred me to vnder- mine the Duchesse,
375    And buzze these Coniurations in her brayne.
376    They say, A craftie Knaue do's need no Broker,
377    Yet am I {Suffolke} and the Cardinalls Broker.
378    {#Hume}, if you take not heed, you shall goe neere
379    To call them both a payre of craftie Knaues.
380    Well, so it stands: and thus I feare at last,
381    {Humes} Knauerie will be the Duchesse Wracke,
382    And her Attainture, will be {Humphreyes} fall:
383    Sort how it will, I shall haue Gold for all.  <D {Exit}.>
384    <D {Enter three or foure Petitioners, the Armorers}
385    {Man being one}.>
386   *<S 1.{Pet}.> My Masters, let's stand close, my Lord Pro-tector
387   *will come this way #by and by, and then wee may
388    deliuer our Supplications in the Quill.
389   *<S 2.{Pet}.> Marry the Lord protect him, for hee's a good
390    man, Iesu blesse him.
391    <D {Enter Suffolke, and Queene}.>
392   *<S {Peter}.> Here #a comes me thinkes, and the Queene with
393    him: Ile be the first sure.
394   *<S 2.{Pet}.> Come backe foole, this is the Duke of Suffolk,
395    and not my Lord Protector.
396    <S {Suff}.> How now fellow: would'st any thing with me?
397   *<S 1.{Pet}.> I pray my Lord pardon me, I tooke ye for my
398    Lord Protector.
399   *<S {Queene}.> To my Lord Protector? Are your Supplica-tions
400    to his Lordship? Let me see them: what is thine?
401   *<S 1.{Pet}.> Mine is, and't please your Grace, against {Iohn}
402   *{Goodman}, my Lord Cardinals Man, for keeping my House,
403    and Lands, and Wife and all, from me.
404   *<S {Suff}.> Thy Wife too? that's some Wrong indeede.
405   *What's yours? What's heere? Against the Duke of
406   *Suffolke, for enclosing the Commons of Melforde. How
407    now, Sir Knaue?
408   *<S 2.{Pet}.> Alas Sir, I am but a poore Petitioner of our
409    whole Towneship.
410   *<S {Peter}.> Against my Master {Thomas Horner}, for saying,
411   *That the Duke of Yorke was rightfull Heire to the
412    Crowne.
413   *<S {Queene}.> What say'st thou? Did the Duke of Yorke
414    say, hee was rightfull Heire to the Crowne?
415   *<S {Peter}.> That my Mistresse was? No forsooth: my Master
416    said, That he was, and that the King was an Vsurper.
417    <S {Suff}.> Who is there?
418    <D {Enter Seruant}.>
419   *Take this fellow in, and send for his Master with a Purse-uant
420   *presently: wee'le heare more of your matter before
421    the King.  <D {Exit}.>
422    <S {Queene}.> And as for you that loue to be protected
423    Vnder the Wings of our Protectors Grace,
424    Begin your Suites anew, and sue to him.
425    <D {Teare the Supplication}.>
426    Away, base Cullions: {Suffolke} let them goe.
427    <S {All}.> Come, let's be gone.  <D {Exit}.>
428    <S {Queene}.> My Lord of Suffolke, say, is this the guise?
429    Is this the Fashions in the Court of England?
430    Is this the Gouernment of Britaines #Ile?
431    And this the Royaltie of {Albions} King?
432    What, shall King {Henry} be a Pupill still,
433    Vnder the surly {Glosters} Gouernance?
434    Am I a Queene in Title and in Stile,
435    And must be made a Subiect to a Duke?
436    I tell thee {Poole}, when in the Citie {Tours}
437    Thou ran'st a- tilt in honor of my Loue,
438    And stol'st away the Ladies hearts of France;
439    I thought King {Henry} had resembled thee,
440    In Courage, Courtship, and Proportion:
441    But all his minde is bent to Holinesse,
442    To number {Aue- Maries} on his Beades:
443    His Champions, are the Prophets and Apostles,
444    His Weapons, holy Sawes of sacred Writ,
445    His Studie is his Tilt- yard, and his Loues
446    Are brazen Images of Canonized Saints.
447    I would the Colledge of the Cardinalls
448    Would chuse him Pope, and carry him to Rome,
449    And set the Triple Crowne vpon his Head;
450    That were a State fit for his Holinesse.
451    <S {Suff}.> Madame be patient: as I was cause
452    Your Highnesse came to England, so will I
453    In England worke your Graces full content.
454   *<S {Queene}.> Beside the haughtie Protector, haue we {Beauford}
455    The imperious Churchman; {Somerset}, {Buckingham},
456    And grumbling {Yorke}: and not the least of these,
457    But can doe more in England then the King.
458    <S {Suff}.> And he of these, that can doe most of all,
459    Cannot doe more in England then the {Neuils}:
460    {#Salisbury} and {Warwick} are no simple Peeres.
461    <S {Queene}.> Not all these Lords do vex me halfe so much,
462    As that prowd Dame, the Lord Protectors Wife:
463   *She sweepes it through the Court with troups of Ladies,
464    More like an Empresse, then Duke {Humphreyes} Wife:
465    Strangers in Court, doe take her for the Queene:
466    She beares a Dukes Reuenewes on her backe,
467    And in her heart she scornes our Pouertie:
468    Shall I not liue to be aueng'd on her?
469    Contemptuous base- borne Callot as she is,
470    She vaunted 'mongst her Minions t' other day,
471    The very trayne of her worst wearing Gowne,
472    Was better worth then all my Fathers Lands,
473    Till {Suffolke} gaue two Dukedomes for his Daughter.
474    <S {Suff}.> Madame, my selfe haue lym'd a Bush for her,
475    And plac't a Quier of such enticing Birds,
476    That she will light to listen to the Layes,
477    And neuer mount to trouble you againe.
478    So let her rest: and Madame list to me,
479    For I am bold to counsaile you in this;
480    Although we fancie not the Cardinall,
481    Yet must we ioyne with him and with the Lords,
482    Till we haue brought Duke {Humphrey} in disgrace.
      <P m4v>
483    As for the Duke of Yorke, this late Complaint
484    Will make but little for his benefit:
485    So one by one wee'le #weed them all at last,
486    And you your selfe shall steere the happy Helme.  <D {Exit}.>
487    <D {Sound a Sennet}.>
488    <D {Enter the King, Duke Humfrey, Cardinall, Bucking-ham},
489    {Yorke, Salisbury, Warwicke},
490    {and the Duchesse}.>
491    <S {King}.> For my part, Noble Lords, I care not which,
492    Or {Somerset}, or {Yorke}, all's one to me.
493    <S {Yorke}.> If {Yorke} haue #ill demean'd himselfe in France,
494    Then let him be denay'd the Regent-ship.
495    <S {Som}.> If {Somerset} be vnworthy of the Place,
496    Let {Yorke} be Regent, I will yeeld to him.
497    <S {Warw}.> Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,
498    Dispute not that, {Yorke} is the worthyer.
499    <S {Card}.> Ambitious {Warwicke}, let thy betters speake.
500    <S {Warw}.> The Cardinall's not my better in the field.
501    <S {Buck}.> All in this presence are thy betters, {Warwicke}.
502    <S {Warw}.> {Warwicke} may liue to be the best of all.
503   *<S {Salisb}.> Peace Sonne, and shew some reason {Buckingham}
504    Why {Somerset} should be preferr'd in this?
505    <S {Queene}.> Because the King forsooth will haue it so.
506    <S {Humf}.> Madame, the King is old enough himselfe
507    To giue his Censure: These are no Womens matters.
508    <S {Queene}.> If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
509    To be Protector of his Excellence?
510    <S {Humf}.> Madame, I am Protector of the Realme,
511    And at his pleasure will resigne my Place.
512    <S {Suff}.> Resigne it then, and leaue thine insolence.
513    Since thou wert King; as who is King, but thou?
514    The Common- wealth hath dayly run to wrack,
515    The Dolphin hath preuayl'd beyond the Seas,
516    And all the Peeres and Nobles of the Realme
517    Haue beene as Bond- men to thy Soueraigntie.
518   *<S {Card}.> The Commons hast thou rackt, the Clergies Bags
519    Are lanke and leane with thy Extortions.
520   *<S {Som}.> Thy sumptuous Buildings, and thy Wiues Attyre
521    Haue cost a masse of publique Treasurie.
522    <S {Buck}.> Thy Crueltie in execution
523    Vpon Offendors, hath exceeded Law,
524    And left thee to the mercy of the Law.
525    <S {Queene}.> Thy sale of Offices and Townes in France,
526    If they were knowne, as the suspect is great,
527    Would make thee quickly hop without thy Head.
528    <D {Exit Humfrey}.>
529    Giue me my Fanne: what, Mynion, can ye not?
530    <D {She giues the Duchesse a box on the eare}.>
531    I cry you mercy, Madame: was it you?
532    <S {Duch}.> #Was't I? yea, I it was, prowd French- woman:
533    Could I come neere your Beautie with my Nayles,
534    I could set my ten Commandements in your face.
535    <S {King}.> Sweet Aunt be quiet, 'twas against her #will.
536   *<S {Duch}.> Against her #will, good King? looke to't in time,
537    Shee'le hamper thee, and dandle thee like a Baby:
538    Though in this place most Master weare no Breeches,
539    She shall not strike Dame {Elianor} vnreueng'd.
540    <D {Exit Elianor}.>
541    <S {Buck}.> Lord Cardinall, I will follow {Elianor},
542    And listen after {Humfrey}, how he proceedes:
543    Shee's tickled now, her Fume needs no spurres,
544    Shee'le gallop farre enough to her destruction.
545    <D {Exit Buckingham}.>
546    <D {Enter Humfrey}.>
547    <S {Humf}.> Now Lords, my Choller being ouer- blowne,
548    With walking once about the Quadrangle,
549    I come to talke of Common- wealth Affayres.
550    As for your spightfull false Obiections,
551    Proue them, and I lye open to the Law:
552    But God in mercie so deale with my Soule,
553    As I in dutie loue my King and Countrey.
554    But to the matter that we haue in hand:
555    I say, my Soueraigne, {Yorke} is meetest man
556    To be your Regent in the Realme of France.
557    <S {Suff}.> Before we make election, giue me leaue
558    To shew some reason, of no little force,
559    That {Yorke} is most vnmeet of any man.
560    <S {Yorke}.> Ile tell thee, {Suffolke}, why I am vnmeet.
561    First, for I cannot flatter thee in Pride:
562    Next, if I be appointed for the Place,
563    My Lord of Somerset will keepe me here,
564    Without Discharge, Money, or Furniture,
565    Till France be wonne into the Dolphins hands:
566    Last time I danc't attendance on his #will,
567    Till Paris was besieg'd, famisht, and lost.
568    <S {Warw}.> That can I witnesse, and a fouler fact
569    Did neuer Traytor in the Land commit.
570    <S {Suff}.> Peace head- strong {Warwicke}.
571   *<S {Warw}.> Image of Pride, why should I hold my peace?
572    <D {Enter Armorer and his Man}.>
573    <S {Suff}.> Because here is a man accused of Treason,
574    Pray God the Duke of Yorke excuse himselfe.
575    <S {Yorke}.> Doth any one accuse {Yorke} for a Traytor?
576   *<S {King}.> What mean'st thou, {Suffolke}? tell me, what are
577    these?
578    <S {Suff}.> Please it your Maiestie, this is the man
579    That doth accuse his Master of High Treason;
580    His words were these: That {Richard}, Duke of Yorke,
581    Was rightfull Heire vnto the English Crowne,
582    And that your Maiestie was an Vsurper.
583    <S {King}.> Say man, were these thy words?
584   *<S {Armorer}.> And't shall please your Maiestie, I neuer sayd
585   *nor thought any such matter: God is my witnesse, I am
586    falsely accus'd by the Villaine.
587   *<S {Peter}.> By these tenne bones, my Lords, hee did speake
588   *them to me in the Garret one Night, as wee were scow-ring
589    my Lord of Yorkes Armor.
590    <S {Yorke}.> Base Dunghill Villaine, and Mechanicall,
591    Ile haue thy Head for this thy Traytors speech:
592    I doe beseech your Royall Maiestie,
593    Let him haue all the rigor of the Law.
594   *<S {Armorer}.> Alas, my Lord, hang me if euer I spake the
595   *words: my accuser is my Prentice, and when I did cor-rect
596   *him for his fault the other day, he did vow vpon his
597   *knees he would be euen with me: I haue good witnesse
598   *of this; therefore I beseech your Maiestie, doe not cast
599    away an honest man for a Villaines accusation.
600    <S {King}.> Vnckle, what shall we say to this in law?
601    <S {Humf}.> This doome, my Lord, if I may iudge:
602    Let {Somerset} be Regent o're the French,
603    Because in {Yorke} this breedes suspition;
604    And let these haue a day appointed them
605    For single Combat, in conuenient place,
606    For he hath witnesse of his seruants malice:
607    This is the Law, and this Duke {Humfreyes} doome.
      <P m5>
608    <S {Som}.> I humbly thanke your Royall Maiestie.
609    <S {Armorer}.> And I accept the Combat willingly.
610   *<S {Peter}.> Alas, my Lord, I cannot fight; for Gods sake
611   *pitty my case: the spight of man preuayleth against me.
612   *O Lord haue mercy vpon me, I shall neuer be able to
613    fight a blow: O Lord my heart.
614    <S {Humf}.> Sirrha, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.
615   *<S {King}.> Away with them to Prison: and the day of
616   *Combat, shall be the last of the next moneth. Come
617    {#Somerset}, wee'le see thee sent away.
618    <D {Flourish. Exeunt}.>
619    <D {Enter the Witch, the two Priests, and Bullingbrooke}.>
620   *<S {Hume}.> Come my Masters, the Duchesse I tell you ex-pects
621    performance of your promises.
622   *<S {Bulling}.> Master {Hume}, we are therefore prouided: will
623    her Ladyship behold and heare our Exorcismes?
624    <S {Hume}.> #I, what else? feare you not her courage.
625   *<S {Bulling}.> I haue heard her reported to be a Woman of
626   *an inuincible spirit: but it shall be conuenient, Master
627   *{#Hume}, that you be by her aloft, while wee be busie be-low;
628   *and so I pray you goe in Gods Name, and leaue vs.
629    <D {Exit Hume}.>
630   *Mother {Iordan}, be you prostrate, and grouell on the
631   *Earth; {Iohn Southwell} reade you, and let vs to our worke.
632    <D {Enter Elianor aloft}.>
633    <S {Elianor}.> Well said my Masters, and welcome all: To
634    this geere, the sooner the better.
635   *<S {Bullin}.> Patience, good Lady, Wizards know their times:
636    Deepe Night, darke Night, the silent of the Night,
637    The time of Night when Troy was set on fire,
638    The time when Screech- owles cry, and Bandogs howle,
639    And Spirits walke, and Ghosts breake vp their Graues;
640    That time best fits the worke we haue in hand.
641    Madame, sit you, and feare not: whom wee rayse,
642    Wee will make fast within a hallow'd Verge.
643    <D {Here doe the Ceremonies belonging, and make the Circle},

649    <S {Witch}.> {Asmath}, by the eternall God,
650    Whose name and power thou tremblest at,
651    Answere that I shall aske: for till thou speake,
652    Thou shalt not passe from hence.
653   *<S {Spirit}.> Aske what thou wilt; that I had sayd, and
654    done.
655   *<S {Bulling}.> First of the King: What shall of him be-come?
656   _
657    <S {Spirit}.> The Duke yet liues, that {Henry} shall depose:
658    But him out- liue, and dye a violent death.
659    <S {Bulling}.> What fates await the Duke of Suffolke?
660    <S {Spirit}.> By Water shall he dye, and take his end.
661    <S {Bulling}.> What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?
662    <S {Spirit}.> Let him shun Castles,
663    Safer shall he be vpon the sandie Plaines,
664    Then where Castles mounted stand.
665    Haue done, for more I hardly can endure.
666   *<S {Bulling}.> Discend to Darknesse, and the burning Lake:
667    False Fiend auoide.
668    <D {Thunder and Lightning. Exit Spirit}.>
669    <D {Enter the Duke of Yorke and the Duke of Buckingham}
670    {with their Guard, and breake in}.>
671   *<S {Yorke}.> Lay hands vpon these Traytors, and their trash:
672    Beldam I thinke we watcht you at an ynch.
673   *What Madame, are you there? the King & Commonweale
674    Are deepely indebted for this peece of paines;
675    My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,
676    See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
677    <S {Elianor}.> Not halfe so bad as thine to Englands King,
678    Iniurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause.
679    <S {Buck}.> True Madame, none at all: what call you this?
680    Away with them, let them be clapt vp close,
681    And kept asunder: you Madame shall with vs.
682    {Stafford} take her to thee.
683    Wee'le see your Trinkets here all forth- comming.
684    All away.  <D {Exit}.>
685   *<S {Yorke}.> Lord {Buckingham}, me thinks you watcht her well:
686    A pretty Plot, well chosen to build vpon.
687    Now pray my Lord, let's see the Deuils Writ.
688    What haue we here?  <D {Reades}.>
689    {The Duke yet liues, that} Henry {shall depose}:
690    {But him out- liue, and dye a violent death}.
691    Why this is iust, {Aio Aeacida Romanos vincere posso}.
692    Well, to the rest:
693    Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolke?
694    {By Water shall he dye, and take his end}.
695    What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
696    {Let him shunne Castles},
697    {Safer shall he be vpon the sandie Plaines},
698    {Then where Castles mounted stand}.
699    Come, come, my Lords,
700    These Oracles are hardly attain'd,
701    And hardly vnderstood.
702    The King is now in progresse towards Saint {Albones},
703    With him, the Husband of this louely Lady:
704    Thither goes these Newes,
705    As fast as Horse can carry them:
706    A sorry Breakfast for my Lord Protector.
707   *<S {Buck}.> Your Grace shal giue me leaue, my Lord of York,
708    To be the Poste, in hope of his reward.
709    <S {Yorke}.> At your pleasure, my good Lord.
710    Who's within there, hoe?
711    <D {Enter a Seruingman}.>
712    Inuite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
713    To suppe with me to morrow Night. Away.

715    <D {Enter the King, Queene, Protector, Cardinall, and}
716    {Suffolke, with Faulkners hallowing}.>
717    <S {Queene}.> Beleeue me Lords, for flying at the Brooke,
718    I saw not better sport these seuen yeeres day:
719    Yet by your leaue, the Winde was very high,
720    And ten to one, old {Ioane} had not gone out.
721    <S {King}.> But what a point, my Lord, your Faulcon made,
722    And what a pytch she flew aboue the rest:
723    To see how God in all his Creatures workes,
724    Yea Man and Birds are fayne of climbing high.
725    <S {Suff}.> No maruell, #and it like your Maiestie,
726    My Lord Protectors Hawkes doe towre so well,
727    They know their Master loues to be aloft,
728    And beares his thoughts aboue his Faulcons Pitch.
729    <S {Glost}.> My Lord, 'tis but a base ignoble minde,
730    That mounts no higher then a Bird can sore:
      <P m5v>
731   *<S {Card}.> I thought as much, hee would be aboue the
732    Clouds.
733    <S {Glost}.> #I my Lord Cardinall, how thinke you by that?
734    Were it not good your Grace could flye to Heauen?
735    <S {King}.> The Treasurie of euerlasting Ioy.
736   *<S {Card}.> Thy Heauen is on Earth, thine Eyes & Thoughts
737    Beat on a Crowne, the Treasure of thy Heart,
738    Pernitious Protector, dangerous Peere,
739    That smooth'st it so with King and Common- weale.
740    <S {Glost}.> What, Cardinall?
741    Is your Priest- hood growne peremptorie?
742    {Tantaene animis Coelestibus irae}, Church- men so hot?
743    Good Vnckle hide such mallice:
744    With such Holynesse can you doe it?
745    <S {Suff}.> No mallice Sir, no more then well becomes
746    So good a Quarrell, and so bad a Peere.
747    <S {Glost}.> As who, my Lord?
748    <S {Suff}.> Why, as you, my Lord,
749    An't like your Lordly Lords Protectorship.
750   *<S {Glost}.> Why {Suffolke}, England knowes thine insolence.
751    <S {Queene}.> And thy Ambition, {Gloster}.
752    <S {King}.> I prythee peace, good Queene,
753    And whet not on these furious Peeres,
754    For blessed are the Peace- makers on Earth.
755    <S {Card}.> Let me be blessed for the Peace I make
756    Against this prowd Protector with my Sword.
757   *<S {Glost}.> Faith holy Vnckle, would't were come to that.
758    <S {Card}.> Marry, when thou dar'st.
759    <S {Glost}.> Make vp no factious numbers for the matter,
760    In thine owne person answere thy abuse.
761    <S {Card}.> #I, where thou dar'st not peepe:
762    And if thou dar'st, this Euening,
763    On the East side of the Groue.
764    <S {King}.> How now, my Lords?
765    <S {Card}.> Beleeue me, Cousin {Gloster},
766    Had not your man put vp the Fowle so suddenly,
767    We had had more sport.
768    Come with thy two- hand Sword.
769    <S {Glost}.> True Vnckle, are ye aduis'd?
770    The East side of the Groue:
771    Cardinall, I am with you.
772    <S {King}.> Why how now, Vnckle {Gloster}?
773    <S {Glost}.> Talking of Hawking; nothing else, my Lord.
774    Now by Gods Mother, Priest,
775    Ile shaue your Crowne for this,
776    Or all my Fence shall fayle.
777   *<S {Card}.> {Medice teipsum}, Protector see to't well, protect
778    your selfe.
779    <S {King}.> The Windes grow high,
780    So doe your Stomacks, Lords:
781    How irkesome is this Musick to my heart?
782    When such Strings iarre, what hope of Harmony?
783    I pray my Lords let me compound this strife.
784    <D {Enter one crying a Miracle}.>
785    <S {Glost}.> What meanes this noyse?
786    Fellow, what Miracle do'st thou proclayme?
787    <S {One}.> A Miracle, a Miracle.
788   *<S {Suffolke}.> Come to the King, and tell him what Mi-racle.
789   _
790    <S {One}.> Forsooth, a blinde man at Saint {Albones} Shrine,
791    Within this halfe houre hath receiu'd his sight,
792    A man that ne're saw in his life before.
793    <S {King}.> Now God be prays'd, that to beleeuing Soules
794    Giues Light in Darknesse, Comfort in Despaire.
795    <D {Enter the Maior of Saint Albones, and his Brethren},
796    {bearing the man betweene two in a Chayre}.>
797    <S {Card}.> Here comes the Townes- men, on Procession,
798    To present your Highnesse with the man.
799    <S {King}.> Great is his comfort in this Earthly Vale,
800    Although by his sight his sinne be multiplyed.
801   *<S {Glost}.> Stand by, my Masters, bring him neere the King,
802    His Highnesse pleasure is to talke with him.
803    <S {King}.> Good- fellow, tell vs here the circumstance,
804    That we for thee may glorifie the Lord.
805    What, hast thou beene long blinde, and now restor'd?
806    <S {Simpc}.> Borne blinde, and't please your Grace.
807    <S {Wife}.> #I indeede was he.
808    <S {Suff}.> What Woman is this?
809    <S {Wife}.> His Wife, and't like your Worship.
810   *<S {Glost}.> Hadst thou been his Mother, thou could'st haue
811    better told.
812    <S {King}.> Where wert thou borne?
813   *<S {Simpc}.> At Barwick in the North, and't like your
814    Grace.
815    <S {King}.> Poore Soule,
816    Gods goodnesse hath beene great to thee:
817    Let neuer Day nor Night vnhallowed passe,
818    But still remember what the Lord hath done.
819    <S {Queene}.> Tell me, good- fellow,
820    Cam'st thou here by Chance, or of Deuotion,
821    To this holy Shrine?
822    <S {Simpc}.> God knowes of pure Deuotion,
823    Being call'd a hundred times, and oftner,
824    In my sleepe, by good Saint {Albon}:
825    Who said; {Symon}, come; come offer at my Shrine,
826    And I will helpe thee.
827    <S {Wife}.> Most true, forsooth:
828    And many time and oft my selfe haue heard a Voyce,
829    To call him so.
830    <S {Card}.> What, art thou lame?
831    <S {Simpc}.> #I, God Almightie helpe me.
832    <S {Suff}.> How cam'st thou so?
833    <S {Simpc}.> A fall off of a Tree.
834    <S {Wife}.> A Plum- tree, Master.
835    <S {Glost}.> How long hast thou beene blinde?
836    <S {Simpc}.> O borne so, Master.
837    <S {Glost}.> What, and would'st climbe a Tree?
838    <S {Simpc}.> But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
839    <S {Wife}.> Too true, and bought his climbing very deare.
840   *<S {Glost}.> 'Masse, thou lou'dst Plummes well, that would'st
841    venture so.
842   *<S {Simpc}.> Alas, good Master, my Wife desired some
843   *Damsons, and made me climbe, with danger of my
844    Life.
845    <S {Glost}.> A subtill Knaue, but yet it shall not serue:
846    Let me see thine Eyes; winck now, now open them,
847    In my opinion, yet thou seest not well.
848   *<S {Simpc}.> Yes Master, cleare as day, I thanke God and
849    Saint {Albones}.
850   *<S {Glost}.> Say'st thou me so: what Colour is this Cloake
851    of?
852    <S {Simpc}.> Red Master, Red as Blood.
853   *<S {Glost}.> Why that's well said: What Colour is my
854    Gowne of?
855    <S {Simpc}.> Black forsooth, Coale- Black, as Iet.
856   *<S {King}.> Why then, thou know'st what Colour Iet is
857    of?
858    <S {Suff}.> And yet I thinke, Iet did he neuer see.
      <P m6>
859   *<S {Glost}.> But Cloakes and Gownes, before this day, a
860    many.
861    <S {Wife}.> Neuer before this day, in all his life.
862    <S {Glost}.> Tell me Sirrha, what's my Name?
863    <S {Simpc}.> Alas Master, I know not.
864    <S {Glost}.> What's his Name?
865    <S {Simpc}.> I know not.
866    <S {Glost}.> Nor his?
867    <S {Simpc}.> No indeede, Master.
868    <S {Glost}.> What's thine owne Name?
869    <S {Simpc}.> {Saunder Simpcoxe}, #and if it please you, Master.
870    <S {Glost}.> Then {Saunder}, sit there,
871    The lying'st Knaue in Christendome.
872    If thou hadst beene borne blinde,
873    Thou might'st as well haue knowne all our Names,
874    As thus to name the seuerall Colours we doe weare.
875    Sight may distinguish of Colours:
876    But suddenly to nominate them all,
877    It is impossible.
878    My Lords, Saint {Albone} here hath done a Miracle:
879    And would ye not thinke it, Cunning to be great,
880    That could restore this Cripple to his Legges againe.
881    <S {Simpc}.> O Master, that you could?
882    <S {Glost}.> My Masters of Saint {Albones},
883    Haue you not Beadles in your Towne,
884    And Things call'd Whippes?
885    <S {Maior}.> Yes, my Lord, if it please your Grace.
886    <S {Glost}.> Then send for one presently.
887    <S {Maior}.> Sirrha, goe fetch the Beadle hither straight.
888    <D {Exit}.>
889    <S {Glost}.> Now fetch me a Stoole hither #by and by.
890   *Now Sirrha, if you meane to saue your selfe from Whip-ping,
891   *leape me ouer this Stoole, and runne away.
892    <S {Simpc}.> Alas Master, I am not able to stand alone:
893    You goe about to torture me in vaine.
894    <D {Enter a Beadle with Whippes}.>
895   *<S {Glost}.> Well Sir, we must haue you finde your Legges.
896   *Sirrha Beadle, whippe him till he leape ouer that same
897    Stoole.
898    <S {Beadle}.> I will, my Lord.
899    Come on Sirrha, off with your Doublet, quickly.
900   *<S {Simpc}.> Alas Master, what shall I doe? I am not able to
901    stand.
902    <D {After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leapes ouer}
903    {the Stoole, and runnes away: and they}
904    {follow, and cry, A Miracle}.>
905    <S {King}.> O God, seest thou this, and bearest so long?
906    <S {Queene}.> It made me laugh, to see the Villaine runne.
907    <S {Glost}.> Follow the Knaue, and take this Drab away.
908    <S {Wife}.> Alas Sir, we did it for pure need.
909    <S {Glost}.> Let the[m] be whipt through euery Market Towne,
910    Till they come to Barwick, from whence they came.
911    <D {Exit}.>
912    <S {Card}.> Duke {Humfrey} ha's done a Miracle to day.
913    <S {Suff}.> True: made the Lame to leape and flye away.
914    <S {Glost}.> But you haue done more Miracles then I:
915    You made in a day, my Lord, whole Townes to flye.
916    <D {Enter Buckingham}.>
917    <S {King}.> What Tidings with our Cousin {Buckingham}?
918    <S {Buck}.> Such as my heart doth tremble to vnfold:
919    A sort of naughtie persons, lewdly bent,
920    Vnder the Countenance and Confederacie
921    Of Lady {Elianor}, the Protectors Wife,
922    The Ring- leader and Head of all this Rout,
923    Haue practis'd dangerously against your State,
924    Dealing with Witches and with Coniurers,
925    Whom we haue apprehended in the Fact,
926    Raysing vp wicked Spirits from vnder ground,
927    Demanding of King {Henries} Life and Death,
928    And other of your Highnesse Priuie Councell,
929    As more at large your Grace shall vnderstand.
930    <S {Card}.> And so my Lord Protector, by this meanes
931    Your Lady is forth- comming, yet at London.
932    This Newes I thinke hath turn'd your Weapons edge;
933    'Tis like, my Lord, you will not keepe your houre.
934   *<S {Glost}.> Ambitious Church- man, leaue to afflict my heart:
935    Sorrow and griefe haue vanquisht all my powers;
936    And vanquisht as I am, I yeeld to thee,
937    Or to the meanest Groome.
938   *<S {King}.> O God, what mischiefes work the wicked ones?
939    Heaping confusion on their owne heads thereby.
940    <S {Queene}.> {Gloster}, see here the Taincture of thy Nest,
941    And looke thy selfe be faultlesse, thou wert best.
942   *<S {Glost}.> Madame, for my selfe, to Heauen I doe appeale,
943    How I haue lou'd my King, and Common- weale:
944    And for my Wife, I know not how it stands,
945    Sorry I am to heare what I haue heard,
946    Noble shee is: but if shee haue forgot
947    Honor and Vertue, and conuers't with such,
948    As like to Pytch, defile Nobilitie;
949    I banish her my Bed, and Companie,
950    And giue her as a Prey to Law and Shame,
951    That hath dis- honored {Glosters} honest Name.
952    <S {King}.> Well, for this Night we will repose vs here:
953    To morrow toward London, back againe,
954    To looke into this Businesse thorowly,
955    And call these foule Offendors to their Answeres;
956    And poyse the Cause in Iustice equall Scales,
957   *Whose Beame stands sure, whose rightful cause preuailes.
958    <D {Flourish. Exeunt}.>
959    <D {Enter Yorke, Salisbury, and Warwick}.>
960   *<S {Yorke}.> Now my good Lords of Salisbury & Warwick,
961    Our simple Supper ended, giue me leaue,
962    In this close Walke, to satisfie my selfe,
963    In crauing your opinion of my Title,
964    Which is infallible, to Englands Crowne.
965    <S {Salisb}.> My Lord, I long to heare it at full.
966   *<S {Warw}.> Sweet {Yorke} begin: and if thy clayme be good,
967    The {Neuills} are thy Subiects to command.
968    <S {Yorke}.> Then thus:
969    {Edward} the third, my Lords, had seuen Sonnes:
970    The first, {Edward} the Black- Prince, Prince of Wales;
971    The second, {William} of Hatfield; and the third,
972    {Lionel}, Duke of Clarence; next to whom,
973    Was {Iohn} of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
974    The fift, was {Edmond Langley}, Duke of Yorke;
975    The sixt, was {Thomas} of Woodstock, Duke of Gloster;
976    {William} of Windsor was the seuenth, and last.
977    {Edward} the Black- Prince dyed before his Father,
978    And left behinde him {Richard}, his onely Sonne,
979    Who after {Edward} the third's death, raign'd as King,
980    Till {Henry Bullingbrooke}, Duke of Lancaster,
981    The eldest Sonne and Heire of {Iohn} of Gaunt,
982    Crown'd by the Name of {Henry} the fourth,
983    Seiz'd on the Realme, depos'd the rightfull King,
984   *Sent his poore Queene to France, from whence she came,
      <P m6v>
985    And him to Pumfret; where, as all you know,
986    Harmelesse {Richard} was murthered traiterously.
987    <S {Warw}.> Father, the Duke hath told the truth;
988    Thus got the House of {Lancaster} the Crowne.
989   *<S {Yorke}.> Which now they hold by force, and not by right:
990    For {Richard}, the first Sonnes Heire, being dead,
991    The Issue of the next Sonne should haue reign'd.
992   *<S {Salisb}.> But {William} of Hatfield dyed without an
993    Heire.
994    <S {Yorke}.> The third Sonne, Duke of Clarence,
995    From whose Line I clayme the Crowne,
996    Had Issue {Phillip}, a Daughter,
997    Who marryed {Edmond Mortimer}, Earle of March:
998    {Edmond} had Issue, {Roger}, Earle of March;
999    {Roger} had Issue, {Edmond}, {Anne}, and {Elianor}.
1000   <S {Salisb}.> This {Edmond}, in the Reigne of {Bullingbrooke},
1001   As I haue read, layd clayme vnto the Crowne,
1002   And but for {Owen Glendour}, had beene King;
1003   Who kept him in Captiuitie, till he dyed.
1004   But, to the rest.
1005   <S {Yorke}.> His eldest Sister, {Anne},
1006   My Mother, being Heire vnto the Crowne,
1007   Marryed {Richard}, Earle of Cambridge,
1008   Who was to {Edmond Langley},
1009   {Edward} the thirds fift Sonnes Sonne;
1010   By her I clayme the Kingdome:
1011   She was Heire to {Roger}, Earle of March,
1012   Who was the Sonne of {Edmond Mortimer},
1013   Who marryed {Phillip}, sole Daughter
1014   Vnto {Lionel}, Duke of Clarence.
1015   So, if the Issue of the elder Sonne
1016   Succeed before the younger, I am King.
1017   <S {Warw}.> What plaine proceedings is more plain then this?
1018   {Henry} doth clayme the Crowne from {Iohn} of Gaunt,
1019   The fourth Sonne, {Yorke} claymes it from the third:
1020   Till {Lionels} Issue fayles, his should not reigne.
1021   It fayles not yet, but flourishes in thee,
1022   And in thy Sonnes, faire slippes of such a Stock.
1023   Then Father {Salisbury}, kneele we together,
1024   And in this priuate Plot be we the first,
1025   That shall salute our rightfull Soueraigne
1026   With honor of his Birth- right to the Crowne.
1027  *<S {Both}.> Long liue our Soueraigne {Richard}, Englands
1028   King.
1029   <S {Yorke}.> We thanke you Lords:
1030   But I am not your King, till I be Crown'd,
1031   And that my Sword be stayn'd
1032   With heart- blood of the House of {Lancaster}:
1033   And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
1034   But with aduice and silent secrecie.
1035   Doe you as I doe in these dangerous dayes,
1036   Winke at the Duke of Suffolkes insolence,
1037   At {Beaufords} Pride, at {Somersets} Ambition,
1038   At {Buckingham}, and all the Crew of them,
1039   Till they haue snar'd the Shepheard of the Flock,
1040   That vertuous Prince, the good Duke {Humfrey}:
1041   'Tis that they seeke; and they, in seeking that,
1042   Shall finde their deaths, if {Yorke} can prophecie.
1043  *<S {Salisb}.> My Lord, breake we off; we know your minde
1044   at full.
1045  *<S {Warw}.> My heart assures me, that the Earle of Warwick
1046   Shall one day make the Duke of Yorke a King.
1047   <S {Yorke}.> And {Neuill}, this I doe assure my selfe,
1048   <S {Richard}> shall liue to make the Earle of Warwick
1049   The greatest man in England, but the King.
1050   <D {Exeunt}.>
1051   <D {Sound Trumpets. Enter the King and State},
1052   {with Guard, to banish the Duchesse}.>
1053   <S {King}.> Stand forth Dame {Elianor Cobham},
1054   {Glosters} Wife:
1055   In sight of God, and vs, your guilt is great,
1056   Receiue the Sentence of the Law for sinne,
1057   Such as by Gods Booke are adiudg'd to death.
1058   You foure from hence to Prison, back againe;
1059   From thence, vnto the place of Execution:
1060   The Witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,
1061   And you three shall be strangled on the Gallowes.
1062   You Madame, for you are more Nobly borne,
1063   Despoyled of your Honor in your Life,
1064   Shall, after three dayes open Penance done,
1065   Liue in your Countrey here, in Banishment,
1066   With Sir {Iohn Stanly}, in the #Ile of Man.
1067  *<S {Elianor}.> Welcome is Banishment, welcome were my
1068   Death.
1069   <S {Glost}.> {Elianor}, the Law thou seest hath iudged thee,
1070   I cannot iustifie whom the Law condemnes:
1071   Mine eyes are full of teares, my heart of griefe.
1072   Ah {Humfrey}, this dishonor in thine age,
1073   Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground.
1074   I beseech your Maiestie giue me leaue to goe;
1075   Sorrow would sollace, and mine Age would ease.
1076   <S {King}.> Stay {Humfrey}, Duke of Gloster,
1077   Ere thou goe, giue vp thy Staffe,
1078   {Henry} will to himselfe Protector be,
1079   And God shall be my hope, my stay, my guide,
1080   And Lanthorne to my feete:
1081   And goe in peace, {Humfrey}, no lesse belou'd,
1082   Then when thou wert Protector to thy King.
1083   <S {Queene}.> I see no reason, why a King of yeeres
1084   Should be to be protected like a Child,
1085   God and King {Henry} gouerne Englands Realme:
1086   Giue vp your Staffe, Sir, and the King his Realme.
1087   <S {Glost}.> My Staffe? Here, Noble {Henry}, is my Staffe:
1088   As willingly doe I the same resigne,
1089   As ere thy Father {Henry} made it mine;
1090   And euen as willingly at thy feete I leaue it,
1091   As others would ambitiously receiue it.
1092   Farewell good King: when I am dead, and gone,
1093   May honorable Peace attend thy Throne.
1094   <D {Exit Gloster}.>
1095  *<S {Queene}.> Why now is {Henry} King, and {Margaret} Queen,
1096   And {Humfrey}, Duke of Gloster, scarce himselfe,
1097   That beares so shrewd a mayme: two Pulls at once;
1098   His Lady banisht, and a Limbe lopt off.
1099   This Staffe of Honor raught, there let it stand,
1100   Where it best fits to be, in {Henries} hand.
1101  *<S {Suff}.> Thus droupes this loftie Pyne, & hangs his sprayes,
1102   Thus {Elianors} Pride dyes in her youngest dayes.
1103   <S {Yorke}.> Lords, let him goe. Please it your Maiestie,
1104   This is the day appointed for the Combat,
1105   And ready are the Appellant and Defendant,
1106   The Armorer and his Man, to enter the Lists,
1107   So please your Highnesse to behold the fight.
1108   <S {Queene}.> #I, good my Lord: for purposely therefore
1109   Left I the Court, to see this Quarrell try'de.
1110   <S {King}.> #A Gods Name see the Lysts and all things fit,
1111   Here let them end it, and God defend the right.
1112   <S {Yorke}.> I neuer saw a fellow worse bestead,
1113   Or more afraid to fight, then is the Appellant,
1114   The seruant of this Armorer, my Lords.
      <P n1>
1115  *<D {Enter at one Doore the Armorer and his Neighbors, drinking}
1116  *{to him so much, that hee is drunke; and he enters with a}
1117  *{Drumme before him, and his Staffe, with a Sand- bagge}
1118  *{fastened to it: and at the other Doore his Man, with a}
1119   {Drumme and Sand- bagge, and Prentices drinking to him}.>
1120  *<S 1.{Neighbor}.> Here Neighbour {Horner}, I drinke to you
1121  *in a Cup of Sack; and feare not Neighbor, you shall doe
1122   well enough.
1123  *<S 2.{Neighbor}.> And here Neighbour, here's a Cuppe of
1124   Charneco.
1125  *<S 3.{Neighbor}.> And here's a Pot of good Double- Beere
1126   Neighbor: drinke, and feare not your Man.
1127  *<S {Armorer}.> Let it come yfaith, and Ile pledge you all,
1128   and a figge for {Peter}.
1129  *<S 1.{Prent}.> Here {Peter}, I drinke to thee, and be not a-fraid.
1130  _
1131   <S 2.{Prent}.> Be merry {Peter}, and feare not thy Master,
1132   Fight for credit of the Prentices.
1133  *<S {Peter}.> I thanke you all: drinke, and pray for me, I pray
1134  *you, for I thinke I haue taken my last Draught in this
1135  *World. Here {Robin}, #and if I dye, I giue thee my Aporne;
1136  *and {#Will}, thou shalt haue my Hammer: and here {Tom},
1137  *take all the Money that I haue. O Lord blesse me, I pray
1138  *God, for I am neuer able to deale with my Master, hee
1139   hath learnt so much fence already.
1140  *<S {Salisb}.> Come, leaue your drinking, and fall to blowes.
1141   Sirrha, what's thy Name?
1142   <S {Peter}.> {Peter} forsooth.
1143   <S {Salisb}.> {Peter}? what more?
1144   <S {Peter}.> {Thumpe}.
1145  *<S {Salisb}.> {Thumpe}? Then see thou thumpe thy Master
1146   well.
1147  *<S {Armorer}.> Masters, I am come hither as it were vpon
1148  *my Mans instigation, to proue him a Knaue, and my selfe
1149  *an honest man: and touching the Duke of Yorke, I will
1150  *take my death, I neuer meant him any #ill, nor the King,
1151  *nor the Queene: and therefore {Peter} haue at thee with a
1152   downe- right blow.
1153  *<S {Yorke}.> Dispatch, this Knaues tongue begins to double.
1154   Sound Trumpets, Alarum to the Combattants.
1155   <D {They fight, and Peter strikes him downe}.>
1156  *<S {Armorer}.> Hold {Peter}, hold, I confesse, I confesse Trea-son.
1157  _
1158   <S {Yorke}.> Take away his Weapon: Fellow thanke God,
1159   and the good Wine in thy Masters way.
1160  *<S {Peter}.> O God, haue I ouercome mine Enemies in this
1161   presence? O {Peter}, thou hast preuayl'd in right.
1162   <S {King}.> Goe, take hence that Traytor from our sight,
1163   For by his death we doe perceiue his guilt,
1164   And God in Iustice hath reueal'd to vs
1165   The truth and innocence of this poore fellow,
1166   Which he had thought to haue murther'd wrongfully.
1167   Come fellow, follow vs for thy Reward.
1168   <D {Sound a flourish. Exeunt}.>
1169   <D {Enter Duke Humfrey and his Men in}
1170   {Mourning Cloakes}.>
1171  *<S {Glost}.> Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a Cloud:
1172   And after Summer, euermore succeedes
1173   Barren Winter, with his wrathfull nipping Cold;
1174   So Cares and Ioyes abound, as Seasons fleet.
1175   Sirs, what's #a Clock?
1176   <S {Seru}.> Tenne, my Lord.
1177   <S {Glost}.> Tenne is the houre that was appointed me,
1178   To watch the comming of my punisht Duchesse:
1179   Vnneath may shee endure the Flintie Streets,
1180   To treade them with her tender- feeling feet.
1181   Sweet {Nell}, #ill can thy Noble Minde abrooke
1182   The abiect People, gazing on thy face,
1183   With enuious Lookes laughing at thy shame,
1184   That erst did follow thy prowd Chariot- Wheeles,
1185   When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
1186   But soft, I thinke she comes, and Ile prepare
1187   My teare- stayn'd eyes, to see her Miseries.
1188   <D {Enter the Duchesse in a white Sheet, and a Taper}
1189   {burning in her hand, with the Sherife}
1190   {and Officers}.>
1191  *<S {Seru}.> So please your Grace, wee'le take her from the
1192   Sherife.
1193  *<S {Gloster}.> No, stirre not for your liues, let her passe
1194   by.
1195   <S {Elianor}.> Come you, my Lord, to see my open shame?
1196   Now thou do'st Penance too. Looke how they gaze,
1197   See how the giddy multitude doe point,
1198   And nodde their heads, and throw their eyes on thee.
1199   Ah {Gloster}, hide thee from their hatefull lookes,
1200   And in thy Closet pent vp, rue my shame,
1201   And banne thine Enemies, both mine and thine.
1202   <S {Glost}.> Be patient, gentle {Nell}, forget this griefe.
1203   <S {Elianor}.> Ah {Gloster}, teach me to forget my selfe:
1204   For whilest I thinke I am thy married Wife,
1205   And thou a Prince, Protector of this Land;
1206   Me thinkes I should not thus be led along,
1207   Mayl'd vp in shame, with Papers on my back,
1208   And follow'd with a Rabble, that reioyce
1209   To see my teares, and heare my deepe- fet groanes.
1210   The ruthlesse Flint doth cut my tender feet,
1211   And when I start, the enuious people laugh,
1212   And bid me be aduised how I treade.
1213   Ah {Humfrey}, can I beare this shamefull yoake?
1214   Trowest thou, that ere Ile looke vpon the World,
1215   Or count them happy, that enioyes the Sunne?
1216   No: Darke shall be my Light, and Night my Day.
1217   To thinke vpon my Pompe, shall be my #Hell.
1218   Sometime Ile say, I am Duke {Humfreyes} Wife,
1219   And he a Prince, and Ruler of the Land:
1220   Yet so he rul'd, and such a Prince he was,
1221   As he stood by, whilest I, his forlorne Duchesse,
1222   Was made a wonder, and a pointing stock
1223   To euery idle Rascall follower.
1224   But be thou milde, and blush not at my shame,
1225   Nor stirre at nothing, till the Axe of Death
1226   Hang ouer thee, as sure it shortly will.
1227   For {Suffolke}, he that can doe all in all
1228   With her, that hateth thee and hates vs all,
1229   And {Yorke}, and impious {Beauford}, that false Priest,
1230   Haue all lym'd Bushes to betray thy Wings,
1231   And flye thou how thou canst, they'le tangle thee.
1232   But feare not thou, vntill thy foot be snar'd,
1233   Nor neuer seeke preuention of thy foes.
1234   <S {Glost}.> Ah {Nell}, forbeare: thou aymest all awry.
1235   I must offend, before I be attainted:
1236   And had I twentie times so many foes,
1237   And each of them had twentie times their power,
1238   All these could not procure me any scathe,
1239   So long as I am loyall, true, and crimelesse.
1240   Would'st haue me rescue thee from this reproach?
      <P n1v>
1241   Why yet thy scandall were not wipt away,
1242   But I in danger for the breach of Law.
1243   Thy greatest helpe is quiet, gentle {Nell}:
1244   I pray thee sort thy heart to patience,
1245   These few dayes wonder will be quickly worne.
1246   <D {Enter a Herald}.>
1247  *<S {Her}.> I summon your Grace to his Maiesties Parliament,
1248   Holden at Bury, the first of this next Moneth.
1249   <S {Glost}.> And my consent ne're ask'd herein before?
1250   This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
1251   My {Nell}, I take my leaue: and Master Sherife,
1252   Let not her Penance exceede the Kings Commission.
1253  *<S {Sh}.> And't please your Grace, here my Commission stayes:
1254   And Sir {Iohn Stanly} is appointed now,
1255   To take her with him to the #Ile of Man.
1256   <S {Glost}.> Must you, Sir {Iohn}, protect my Lady here?
1257  *<S {Stanly}.> So am I giuen in charge, may't please your
1258   Grace.
1259   <S {Glost}.> Entreat her not the worse, in that I pray
1260   You vse her well: the World may laugh againe,
1261   And I may liue to doe you kindnesse, if you doe it her.
1262   And so Sir {Iohn}, farewell.
1263  *<S {Elianor}.> What, gone my Lord, and bid me not fare-well?
1264  _
1265   <S {Glost}.> Witnesse my teares, I cannot stay to speake.
1266   <D {Exit Gloster}.>
1267   <S {Elianor}.> Art thou gone #to? all comfort goe with thee,
1268   For none abides with me: my Ioy, is Death;
1269   Death, at whose Name I oft haue beene afear'd,
1270   Because I wish'd this Worlds eternitie.
1271   {#Stanley}, I prethee goe, and take me hence,
1272   I care not whither, for I begge no fauor;
1273   Onely conuey me where thou art commanded.
1274   <S {Stanley}.> Why, Madame, that is to the #Ile of Man,
1275   There to be vs'd according to your State.
1276   <S {Elianor}.> That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
1277   And shall I then be vs'd reproachfully?
1278  *<S {Stanley}.> Like to a Duchesse, and Duke {Humfreyes} Lady,
1279   According to that State you shall be vs'd.
1280   <S {Elianor}.> Sherife farewell, and better then I fare,
1281   Although thou hast beene Conduct of my shame.
1282   <S {Sherife}.> It is my Office, and Madame pardon me.
1283   <S {Elianor}.> #I, #I, farewell, thy Office is discharg'd:
1284   Come {Stanley}, shall we goe?
1285   <S {Stanley}.> Madame, your Penance done,
1286   Throw off this Sheet,
1287   And goe we to attyre you for our Iourney.
1288  *<S {Elianor}.> My shame will not be shifted with my Sheet:
1289   No, it will hang vpon my richest Robes,
1290   And shew it selfe, attyre me how I can.
1291   Goe, leade the way, I long to see my Prison.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1292   <D {Sound a Senet. Enter King, Queene, Cardinall, Suffolke},
1293   {#Yorke, Buckingham, Salisbury, and Warwicke},
1294   {to the Parliament}.>
1295   <S {King}.> I muse my Lord of Gloster is not come:
1296   'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
1297   What e're occasion keepes him from vs now.
1298   <S {Queene}.> Can you not see? or will ye not obserue
1299   The strangenesse of his alter'd Countenance?
1300   With what a Maiestie he beares himselfe,
1301   How insolent of late he is become,
1302   How prowd, how peremptorie, and vnlike himselfe.
1303   We know the time since he was milde and affable,
1304   And if we did but glance a farre- off Looke,
1305   Immediately he was vpon his Knee,
1306   That all the Court admir'd him for submission.
1307   But meet him now, and be it in the Morne,
1308   When euery one will giue the time of day,
1309   He knits his Brow, and shewes an angry Eye,
1310   And passeth by with stiffe vnbowed Knee,
1311   Disdaining dutie that to vs belongs.
1312   Small Curres are not regarded when they grynne,
1313   But great men tremble when the Lyon rores,
1314   And {Humfrey} is no little Man in England.
1315   First note, that he is neere you in discent,
1316   And should you fall, he is the next will mount.
1317   Me seemeth then, it is no Pollicie,
1318   Respecting what a rancorous minde he beares,
1319   And his aduantage following your decease,
1320   That he should come about your Royall Person,
1321   Or be admitted to your Highnesse Councell.
1322   By flatterie hath he wonne the Commons hearts:
1323   And when he please to make Commotion,
1324   'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
1325   Now 'tis the Spring, and Weeds are shallow- rooted,
1326   Suffer them now, and they'le o're- grow the Garden,
1327   And choake the Herbes for want of Husbandry.
1328   The reuerent care I beare vnto my Lord,
1329   Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.
1330   If it be fond, call it a Womans feare:
1331   Which feare, if better Reasons can supplant,
1332   I will subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke.
1333   My Lord of Suffolke, Buckingham, and Yorke,
1334   Reproue my allegation, if you can,
1335   Or else conclude my words effectuall.
1336   <S {Suff}.> Well hath your Highnesse seene into this Duke:
1337   And had I first beene put to speake my minde,
1338   I thinke I should haue told your Graces Tale.
1339   The Duchesse, by his subornation,
1340   Vpon my Life began her diuellish practises:
1341   Or if he were not priuie to those Faults,
1342   Yet by reputing of his high discent,
1343   As next the King, he was successiue Heire,
1344   And such high vaunts of his Nobilitie,
1345   Did instigate the Bedlam braine- sick Duchesse,
1346   By wicked meanes to frame our Soueraignes fall.
1347   Smooth runnes the Water, where the Brooke is deepe,
1348   And in his simple shew he harbours Treason.
1349   The Fox barkes not, when he would steale the Lambe.
1350   No, no, my Soueraigne, {Glouster} is a man
1351   Vnsounded yet, and full of deepe deceit.
1352   <S {Card}.> Did he not, contrary to forme of Law,
1353   Deuise strange deaths, for small offences done?
1354   <S {Yorke}.> And did he not, in his Protectorship,
1355   Leuie great summes of Money through the Realme,
1356   For Souldiers pay in France, and neuer sent it?
1357   By meanes whereof, the Townes each day reuolted.
1358   <S {Buck}.> Tut, these are petty faults to faults vnknowne,
1359  *Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke {Humfrey}.
1360   <S {King}.> My Lords at once: the care you haue of vs,
1361   To mowe downe Thornes that would annoy our Foot,
1362   Is worthy prayse: but shall I speake my conscience,
1363   Our Kinsman {Gloster} is as innocent,
1364   From meaning Treason to our Royall Person,
1365   As is the sucking Lambe, or harmelesse Doue:
1366   The Duke is vertuous, milde, and too well giuen,
1367   To dreame on euill, or to worke my downefall.
1368  *<S {Qu}.> Ah what's more dangerous, then this fond affiance?
1369   Seemes he a Doue? his feathers are but borrow'd,
1370   For hee's disposed as the hatefull Rauen.
1371   Is he a Lambe? his Skinne is surely lent him,
      <P n2>
1372   For hee's enclin'd as is the rauenous Wolues.
1373   Who cannot steale a shape, that meanes deceit?
1374   Take heed, my Lord, the welfare of vs all,
1375   Hangs on the cutting short that fraudfull man.
1376   <D {Enter Somerset}.>
1377   <S {Som}.> All health vnto my gracious Soueraigne.
1378  *<S {King}.> Welcome Lord {Somerset}: What Newes from
1379   France?
1380   <S {Som}.> That all your Interest in those Territories,
1381   Is vtterly bereft you: all is lost.
1382  *<S {King}.> Cold Newes, Lord {Somerset}: but Gods #will be
1383   done.
1384   <S {Yorke}.> Cold Newes for me: for I had hope of France,
1385   As firmely as I hope for fertile England.
1386   Thus are my Blossomes blasted in the Bud,
1387   And Caterpillers eate my Leaues away:
1388   But I will remedie this geare ere long,
1389   Or sell my Title for a glorious Graue.
1390   <D {Enter Gloucester}.>
1391   <S {Glost}.> All happinesse vnto my Lord the King:
1392   Pardon, my Liege, that I haue stay'd so long.
1393  *<S {Suff}.> Nay {Gloster}, know that thou art come too soone,
1394   Vnlesse thou wert more loyall then thou art:
1395   I doe arrest thee of High Treason here.
1396   <S {Glost}.> Well {Suffolke}, thou shalt not see me blush,
1397   Nor change my Countenance for this Arrest:
1398   A Heart vnspotted, is not easily daunted.
1399   The purest Spring is not so free from mudde,
1400   As I am cleare from Treason to my Soueraigne.
1401   Who can accuse me? wherein am I guiltie?
1402   <S {Yorke}.> 'Tis thought, my Lord,
1403   That you tooke Bribes of France,
1404   And being Protector, stay'd the Souldiers pay,
1405   By meanes whereof, his Highnesse hath lost France.
1406   <S {Glost}.> Is it but thought so?
1407   What are they that thinke it?
1408   I neuer rob'd the Souldiers of their pay,
1409   Nor euer had one penny Bribe from France.
1410   So helpe me God, as I haue watcht the Night,
1411   #I, Night by Night, in studying good for England.
1412   That Doyt that ere I wrested from the King,
1413   Or any Groat I hoorded to my vse,
1414   Be brought against me at my Tryall day.
1415   No: many a Pound of mine owne proper store,
1416   Because I would not taxe the needie Commons,
1417   Haue I dis- pursed to the Garrisons,
1418   And neuer ask'd for restitution.
1419   <S {Card}.> It serues you well, my Lord, to say so much.
1420   <S {Glost}.> I say no more then truth, so helpe me God.
1421   <S {Yorke}.> In your Protectorship, you did deuise
1422   Strange Tortures for Offendors, neuer heard of,
1423   That England was defam'd by Tyrannie.
1424  *<S {Glost}.> Why 'tis well known, that whiles I was Protector,
1425   Pittie was all the fault that was in me:
1426   For I should melt at an Offendors teares,
1427   And lowly words were Ransome for their fault:
1428   Vnlesse it were a bloody Murtherer,
1429   Or foule felonious Theefe, that fleec'd poore passengers,
1430   I neuer gaue them condigne punishment.
1431   Murther indeede, that bloodie sinne, I tortur'd
1432   Aboue the Felon, or what Trespas else.
1433  *<S {Suff}.> My Lord, these faults are easie, quickly answer'd:
1434   But mightier Crimes are lay'd vnto your charge,
1435   Whereof you cannot easily purge your selfe.
1436   I doe arrest you in his Highnesse Name,
1437   And here commit you to my Lord Cardinall
1438   To keepe, vntill your further time of Tryall.
1439   <S {King}.> My Lord of Gloster, 'tis my speciall hope,
1440   That you will cleare your selfe from all suspence,
1441   My Conscience tells me you are innocent.
1442   <S {Glost}.> Ah gracious Lord, these dayes are dangerous:
1443   Vertue is choakt with foule Ambition,
1444   And Charitie chas'd hence by Rancours hand;
1445   Foule Subornation is predominant,
1446   And Equitie exil'd your Highnesse Land.
1447   I know, their Complot is to haue my Life:
1448   And if my death might make this Iland happy,
1449   And proue the Period of their Tyrannie,
1450   I would expend it with all willingnesse.
1451   But mine is made the Prologue to their Play:
1452   For thousands more, that yet suspect no perill,
1453   Will not conclude their plotted Tragedie.
1454   {Beaufords} red sparkling eyes blab his hearts mallice,
1455   And {Suffolks} cloudie Brow his stormie hate;
1456   Sharpe {Buckingham} vnburthens with his tongue,
1457   The enuious Load that lyes vpon his heart:
1458   And dogged {Yorke}, that reaches at the Moone,
1459   Whose ouer- weening Arme I haue pluckt back,
1460   By false accuse doth leuell at my Life.
1461   And you, my Soueraigne Lady, with the rest,
1462   Causelesse haue lay'd disgraces on my head,
1463   And with your best endeuour haue stirr'd vp
1464   My liefest Liege to be mine Enemie:
1465   #I, all of you haue lay'd your heads together,
1466   My selfe had notice of your Conuenticles,
1467   And all to make away my guiltlesse Life.
1468   I shall not want false Witnesse, to condemne me,
1469   Nor store of Treasons, to augment my guilt:
1470   The ancient Prouerbe will be well effected,
1471   A Staffe is quickly found to beat a Dogge.
1472   <S {Card}.> My Liege, his rayling is intollerable.
1473   If those that care to keepe your Royall Person
1474   From Treasons secret Knife, and Traytors Rage,
1475   Be thus vpbrayded, chid, and rated at,
1476   And the Offendor graunted scope of speech,
1477   'Twill make them coole in zeale vnto your Grace.
1478   <S {Suff}.> Hath he not twit our Soueraigne Lady here
1479   With ignominious words, though Clarkely coucht?
1480   As if she had suborned some to sweare
1481   False allegations, to o'rethrow his state.
1482   <S {Qu}.> But I can giue the loser leaue to chide.
1483   <S {Glost}.> Farre truer spoke then meant: I lose indeede,
1484   Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false,
1485   And well such losers may haue leaue to speake.
1486   <S {Buck}.> Hee'le wrest the sence, and hold vs here all day.
1487   Lord Cardinall, he is your Prisoner.
1488   <S {Card}.> Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.
1489  *<S {Glost}.> Ah, thus King {Henry} throwes away his Crutch,
1490   Before his Legges be firme to beare his Body.
1491   Thus is the Shepheard beaten from thy side,
1492   And Wolues are gnarling, who shall gnaw thee first.
1493   Ah that my feare were false, ah that it were;
1494   For good King {Henry}, thy decay I feare.  <D {Exit Gloster}.>
1495  *<S {King}.> My Lords, what to your wisdomes seemeth best,
1496   Doe, or vndoe, as if our selfe were here.
1497  *<S {Queene}.> What, will your Highnesse leaue the Parlia-ment?
1498  _
1499   <S {King}.> #I {Margaret}: my heart is drown'd with griefe,
1500   Whose floud begins to flowe within mine eyes;
1501   My Body round engyrt with miserie:
      <P n2v>
1502   For what's more miserable then Discontent?
1503   Ah Vnckle {Humfrey}, in thy face I see
1504   The Map of Honor, Truth, and Loyaltie:
1505   And yet, good {Humfrey}, is the houre to come,
1506   That ere I prou'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
1507   What lowring Starre now enuies thy estate?
1508   That these great Lords, and {Margaret} our Queene,
1509   Doe seeke subuersion of thy harmelesse Life.
1510   Thou neuer didst them wrong, nor no man wrong:
1511   And as the Butcher takes away the Calfe,
1512   And binds the Wretch, and beats it when it strayes,
1513   Bearing it to the bloody Slaughter- house;
1514   Euen so remorselesse haue they borne him hence:
1515   And as the Damme runnes lowing vp and downe,
1516   Looking the way her harmelesse young one went,
1517   And can doe naught but wayle her Darlings losse;
1518   Euen so my selfe bewayles good {Glosters} case
1519   With sad vnhelpefull teares, and with dimn'd eyes;
1520   Looke after him, and cannot doe him good:
1521   So mightie are his vowed Enemies.
1522   His fortunes I will weepe, and 'twixt each groane,
1523   Say, who's a Traytor? {Gloster} he is none.  <D {Exit}.>
1524   <S {Queene}.> Free Lords:
1525   Cold Snow melts with the Sunnes hot Beames:
1526   {Henry}, my Lord, is cold in great Affaires,
1527   Too full of foolish pittie: and {Glosters} shew
1528   Beguiles him, as the mournefull Crocodile
1529   With sorrow snares relenting passengers;
1530   Or as the Snake, roll'd in a flowring Banke,
1531   With shining checker'd slough doth sting a Child,
1532   That for the beautie thinkes it excellent.
1533   Beleeue me Lords, were none more wise then I,
1534   And yet herein I iudge mine owne Wit good;
1535   This {Gloster} should be quickly rid the World,
1536   To rid vs from the feare we haue of him.
1537   <S {Card}.> That he should dye, is worthie pollicie,
1538   But yet we want a Colour for his death:
1539   'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of Law.
1540   <S {Suff}.> But in my minde, that were no pollicie:
1541   The King will labour still to saue his Life,
1542   The Commons haply rise, to saue his Life;
1543   And yet we haue but triuiall argument,
1544   More then mistrust, that shewes him worthy death.
1545   <S {Yorke}.> So that by this, you would not haue him dye.
1546   <S {Suff}.> Ah {Yorke}, no man aliue, so faine as I.
1547   <S {Yorke}.> 'Tis {Yorke} that hath more reason for his death.
1548   But my Lord Cardinall, and you my Lord of Suffolke,
1549   Say as you thinke, and speake it from your Soules:
1550   #Wer't not all one, an emptie Eagle were set,
1551   To guard the Chicken from a hungry Kyte,
1552   As place Duke {Humfrey} for the Kings Protector?
1553  *<S {Queene}.> So the poore Chicken should be sure of death.
1554  *<S {Suff}.> Madame 'tis true: and #wer't not madnesse then,
1555   To make the Fox surueyor of the Fold?
1556   Who being accus'd a craftie Murtherer,
1557   His guilt should be but idly posted ouer,
1558   Because his purpose is not executed.
1559   No: let him dye, in that he is a Fox,
1560   By nature prou'd an Enemie to the Flock,
1561   Before his Chaps be stayn'd with Crimson blood,
1562   As {Humfrey} prou'd by Reasons to my Liege.
1563   And doe not stand on Quillets how to slay him:
1564   Be it by Gynnes, by Snares, by Subtletie,
1565   Sleeping, or Waking, 'tis no matter how,
1566   So he be dead; for that is good deceit,
1567   Which mates him first, that first intends deceit.
1568   <S {Queene}.> Thrice Noble {Suffolke}, 'tis resolutely spoke.
1569   <S {Suff}.> Not resolute, except so much were done,
1570   For things are often spoke, and seldome meant,
1571   But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
1572   Seeing the deed is meritorious,
1573   And to preserue my Soueraigne from his Foe,
1574   Say but the word, and I will be his Priest.
1575  *<S {Card}.> But I would haue him dead, my Lord of Suffolke,
1576   Ere you can take due Orders for a Priest:
1577   Say you consent, and censure well the deed,
1578   And Ile prouide his Executioner,
1579   I tender so the safetie of my Liege.
1580   <S {Suff}.> Here is my Hand, the deed is worthy doing.
1581   <S {Queene}.> And so say I.
1582   <S {Yorke}.> And I: and now we three haue spoke it,
1583   It skills not greatly who impugnes our doome.
1584   <D {Enter a Poste}.>
1585   <S {Post}.> Great Lords, from Ireland am I come amaine,
1586   To signifie, that Rebels there are vp,
1587   And put the Englishmen vnto the Sword.
1588   Send Succours (Lords) and stop the Rage betime,
1589   Before the Wound doe grow vncurable;
1590   For being greene, there is great hope of helpe.
1591  *<S {Card}.> A Breach that craues a quick expedient stoppe.
1592   What counsaile giue you in this weightie cause?
1593   <S {Yorke}.> That {Somerset} be sent as Regent thither:
1594   'Tis meet that luckie Ruler be imploy'd,
1595   Witnesse the fortune he hath had in France.
1596   <S {Som}.> If {Yorke}, with all his farre- fet pollicie,
1597   Had beene the Regent there, in stead of me,
1598   He neuer would haue stay'd in France so long.
1599   <S {Yorke}.> No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done.
1600   I rather would haue lost my Life betimes,
1601   Then bring a burthen of dis- honour home,
1602   By staying there so long, till all were lost.
1603   Shew me one skarre, character'd on thy Skinne,
1604   Mens flesh preseru'd so whole, doe seldome winne.
1605   <S {Qu}.> Nay then, this sparke will proue a raging fire,
1606   If Wind and Fuell be brought, to feed it with:
1607   No more, good {Yorke}; sweet {Somerset} be still.
1608   Thy fortune, {Yorke}, hadst thou beene Regent there,
1609   Might happily haue prou'd farre worse then his.
1610  *<S {Yorke}.> What, worse then naught? nay, then a shame
1611   take all.
1612  *<S {Somerset}.> And in the number, thee, that wishest
1613   shame.
1614   <S {Card}.> My Lord of Yorke, trie what your fortune is:
1615   Th' vnciuill Kernes of Ireland are in Armes,
1616   And temper Clay with blood of Englishmen.
1617   To Ireland will you leade a Band of men,
1618   Collected choycely, from each Countie some,
1619   And trie your hap against the Irishmen?
1620   <S {Yorke}.> I will, my Lord, so please his Maiestie.
1621   <S {Suff}.> Why, our Authoritie is his consent,
1622   And what we doe establish, he confirmes:
1623   Then, Noble {Yorke}, take thou this Taske in hand.
1624   <S {Yorke}.> I am content: Prouide me Souldiers, Lords,
1625   Whiles I take order for mine owne affaires.
1626   <S {Suff}.> A charge, Lord {Yorke}, that I will see perform'd.
1627   But now returne we to the false Duke {Humfrey}.
1628   <S {Card}.> No more of him: for I will deale with him,
1629   That henceforth he shall trouble vs no more:
1630   And so breake off, the day is almost spent,
1631   Lord {Suffolke}, you and I must talke of that euent.
      <P n3>
1632  *<S {Yorke}.> My Lord of Suffolke, within foureteene dayes
1633   At Bristow I expect my Souldiers,
1634   For there Ile shippe them all for Ireland.
1635  *<S {Suff}.> Ile see it truly done, my Lord of Yorke.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1636   <D {Manet Yorke}.>
1637  *<S {Yorke}.> Now {Yorke}, or neuer, steele thy fearfull thoughts,
1638   And change misdoubt to resolution;
1639   Be that thou hop'st to be, or what thou art;
1640   Resigne to death, it is not worth th' enioying:
1641   Let pale- fac't feare keepe with the meane- borne man,
1642   And finde no harbor in a Royall heart.
1643  *Faster the[n] Spring- time showres, comes thoght on thoght,
1644   And not a thought, but thinkes on Dignitie.
1645   My Brayne, more busie then the laboring Spider,
1646   Weaues tedious Snares to trap mine Enemies.
1647   Well Nobles, well: 'tis politikely done,
1648   To send me packing with an Hoast of men:
1649   I feare me, you but warme the starued Snake,
1650   Who cherisht in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
1651   'Twas men I lackt, and you will giue them me;
1652   I take it kindly: yet be well assur'd,
1653   You put sharpe Weapons in a mad- mans hands.
1654   Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mightie Band,
1655   I will stirre vp in England some black Storme,
1656   Shall blowe ten thousand Soules to Heauen, or #Hell:
1657   And this fell Tempest shall not cease to rage,
1658   Vntill the Golden Circuit on my Head,
1659   Like to the glorious Sunnes transparant Beames,
1660   Doe calme the furie of this mad- bred Flawe.
1661   And for a minister of my intent,
1662   I haue seduc'd a head- strong Kentishman,
1663   {#Iohn Cade} of Ashford,
1664   To make Commotion, as full well he can,
1665   Vnder the title of {Iohn Mortimer}.
1666   In Ireland haue I seene this stubborne {Cade}
1667   Oppose himselfe against a Troupe of Kernes,
1668   And fought so long, till that his thighes with Darts
1669   Were almost like a sharpe- quill'd Porpentine:
1670   And in the end being rescued, I haue seene
1671   Him capre vpright, like a wilde Morisco,
1672   Shaking the bloody Darts, as he his Bells.
1673   Full often, like a shag- hayr'd craftie Kerne,
1674   Hath he conuersed with the Enemie,
1675   And vndiscouer'd, come to me againe,
1676   And giuen me notice of their Villanies.
1677   This Deuill here shall be my substitute;
1678   For that {Iohn Mortimer}, which now is dead,
1679   In face, in gate, in speech he doth resemble.
1680   By this, I shall perceiue the Commons minde,
1681   How they affect the House and Clayme of {Yorke}.
1682   Say he be taken, rackt, and tortured;
1683   I know, no paine they can inflict vpon him,
1684   Will make him say, I mou'd him to those Armes.
1685   Say that he thriue, as 'tis great like he will,
1686   Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,
1687   And reape the Haruest which that Rascall sow'd.
1688   For {Humfrey}; being dead, as he shall be,
1689   And {Henry} put apart: the next for me.  <D {Exit}.>
1690   <D {Enter two or three running ouer the Stage, from the}
1691   {Murther of Duke Humfrey}.>
1692   <S 1.> Runne to my Lord of Suffolke: let him know
1693   We haue dispatcht the Duke, as he commanded.
1694   <S 2.> Oh, that it were to doe: what haue we done?
1695   Didst euer heare a man so penitent?  <D {Enter Suffolke}.>
1696   <S 1.> Here comes my Lord.
1697   <S {Suff}.> Now Sirs, haue you dispatcht this thing?
1698   <S 1.> #I, my good Lord, hee's dead.
1699  *<S {Suff}.> Why that's well said. Goe, get you to my House,
1700   I will reward you for this venturous deed:
1701   The King and all the Peeres are here at hand.
1702   Haue you layd faire the Bed? Is all things well,
1703   According as I gaue directions?
1704   <S 1.> 'Tis, my good Lord.
1705   <S {Suff}.> Away, be gone.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1706   <D {Sound Trumpets. Enter the King, the Queene},
1707   {Cardinall, Suffolke, Somerset, with}
1708   {Attendants}.>
1709   <S {King}.> Goe call our Vnckle to our presence straight:
1710   Say, we intend to try his Grace to day,
1711   If he be guiltie, as 'tis published.
1712   <S {Suff}.> Ile call him presently, my Noble Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
1713   <S {King}.> Lords take your places: and I pray you all
1714   Proceed no straiter 'gainst our Vnckle {Gloster},
1715   Then from true euidence, of good esteeme,
1716   He be approu'd in practise culpable.
1717   <S {Queene}.> God forbid any Malice should preuayle,
1718   That faultlesse may condemne a Noble man:
1719   Pray God he may acquit him of suspition.
1720  *<S {King}.> I thanke thee {Nell}, these wordes content mee
1721   much.
1722   <D {Enter Suffolke}.>
1723   How now? why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
1724   Where is our Vnckle? what's the matter, {Suffolke}?
1725   <S {Suff}.> Dead in his Bed, my Lord: {Gloster} is dead.
1726   <S {Queene}.> Marry God forfend.
1727  *<S {Card}.> Gods secret Iudgement: I did dreame to Night,
1728   The Duke was dumbe, and could not speake a word.
1729   <D {King sounds}.>
1730  *<S {Qu}.> How fares my Lord? Helpe Lords, the King is
1731   dead.
1732   <S {Som}.> Rere vp his Body, wring him by the Nose.
1733  *<S {Qu}.> Runne, goe, helpe, helpe: Oh {Henry} ope thine eyes.
1734   <S {Suff}.> He doth reuiue againe, Madame be patient.
1735   <S {King}.> Oh Heauenly God.
1736   <S {Qu}.> How fares my gracious Lord?
1737  *<S {Suff}.> Comfort my Soueraigne, gracious {Henry} com-fort.
1738  _
1739   <S {King}.> What, doth my Lord of Suffolke comfort me?
1740   Came he right now to sing a Rauens Note,
1741   Whose dismall tune bereft my Vitall powres:
1742   And thinkes he, that the chirping of a Wren,
1743   By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
1744   Can chase away the first- conceiued sound?
1745   Hide not thy poyson with such sugred words,
1746   Lay not thy hands on me: forbeare I say,
1747   Their touch affrights me as a Serpents sting.
1748   Thou balefull Messenger, out of my sight:
1749   Vpon thy eye- balls, murderous Tyrannie
1750   Sits in grim Maiestie, to fright the World.
1751   Looke not vpon me, for thine eyes are wounding;
1752   Yet doe not goe away: come Basiliske,
1753   And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight:
1754   For in the shade of death, I shall finde ioy;
1755   In life, but double death, now {Gloster}'s dead.
1756   <S {Queene}.> Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolke thus?
1757   Although the Duke was enemie to him,
1758   Yet he most Christian- like laments his death:
1759   And for my selfe, Foe as he was to me,
1760   Might liquid teares, or heart- offending groanes,
1761   Or blood- consuming sighes recall his Life;
      <P n3v><C B>
1762   I would be blinde with weeping, sicke with grones,
1763   Looke pale as Prim- rose with blood- drinking sighes,
1764   And all to haue the Noble Duke aliue.
1765   What know I how the world may deeme of me?
1766   For it is knowne we were but hollow Friends:
1767   It may be iudg'd I made the Duke away,
1768   So shall my name with Slanders tongue be wounded,
1769   And Princes Courts be fill'd with my reproach:
1770   This get I by his death: Aye me vnhappie,
1771   To be a Queene, and Crown'd with infamie.
1772   <S {King}.> Ah woe is me for Gloster, wretched man.
1773   <S {Queen}.> Be woe for me, more wretched then he is.
1774   What, Dost thou turne away, and hide thy face?
1775   I am no loathsome Leaper, looke on me.
1776   What? Art thou like the Adder waxen deafe?
1777   Be poysonous too, and kill thy forlorne Queene.
1778   Is all thy comfort shut in Glosters Tombe?
1779   Why then Dame {Elianor} was neere thy ioy.
1780   Erect his Statue, and worship it,
1781   And make my Image but an Ale- house signe.
1782   Was I for this nye wrack'd vpon the Sea,
1783   And twice by aukward winde from Englands banke
1784   Droue backe againe vnto my Natiue Clime.
1785   What boaded this? but well fore- warning winde
1786   Did seeme to say, seeke not a Scorpions Nest,
1787   Nor set no footing on this vnkinde Shore.
1788   What did I then? But curst the gentle gusts,
1789   And he that loos'd them forth their Brazen Caues,
1790   And bid them blow towards Englands blessed shore,
1791   Or turne our Sterne vpon a dreadfull Rocke:
1792   Yet Aeolus would not be a murtherer,
1793   But left that hatefull office vnto thee.
1794   The pretty vaulting Sea refus'd to drowne me,
1795   Knowing that thou wouldst haue me drown'd on shore
1796   With teares as salt as Sea, through thy vnkindnesse.
1797   The splitting Rockes cowr'd in the sinking sands,
1798   And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
1799   Because thy flinty heart more hard then they,
1800   Might in thy Pallace, perish {Elianor}.
1801   As farre as I could ken thy Chalky Cliffes,
1802   When from thy Shore, the Tempest beate vs backe,
1803   I stood vpon the Hatches in the storme:
1804   And when the duskie sky, began to rob
1805   My earnest- gaping- sight of thy Lands view,
1806   I tooke a costly Iewell from my necke,
1807   A Hart it was bound in with Diamonds,
1808   And threw it towards thy Land: The Sea receiu'd it,
1809   And so I wish'd thy body might my Heart:
1810   And euen with this, I lost faire Englands view,
1811   And bid mine eyes be packing with my Heart,
1812   And call'd them blinde and duskie Spectacles,
1813   For loosing ken of {Albions} wished Coast.
1814   How often haue I tempted Suffolkes tongue
1815   (The agent of thy foule inconstancie)
1816   To sit and watch me as {Ascanius} did,
1817   When he to madding {Dido} would vnfold
1818   His Fathers Acts, commenc'd in burning Troy.
1819   Am I not witcht like her? Or thou not false like him?
1820   Aye me, I can no more: Dye {Elinor},
1821   For {Henry} weepes, that thou dost liue so long.
1822   <D {Noyse within. Enter Warwicke, and many}
1823   {Commons}.>
1824   <S {War}.> It is reported, mighty Soueraigne,
1825   That good Duke {Humfrey} Traiterously is murdred
1826   By Suffolke, and the Cardinall {Beaufords} meanes:
1827   The Commons like an angry Hiue of Bees
1828   That want their Leader, scatter vp and downe,
1829   And care not who they sting in his reuenge.
1830   My selfe haue calm'd their spleenfull mutinie,
1831   Vntill they heare the order of his death.
1832   <S {King}.> That he is dead good Warwick, 'tis too true,
1833   But how he dyed, God knowes, not {Henry}:
1834   Enter his Chamber, view his breathlesse Corpes,
1835   And comment then vpon his sodaine death.
1836   <S {War}.> That shall I do my Liege; Stay Salsburie
1837   With the rude multitude, till I returne.
1838  *<S {King}.> O thou that iudgest all things, stay my thoghts:
1839   My thoughts, that labour to perswade my soule,
1840   Some violent hands were laid on {Humfries} life:
1841   If my suspect be false, forgiue me God,
1842   For iudgement onely doth belong to thee:
1843   Faine would I go to chafe his palie lips,
1844   With twenty thousand kisses, and to draine
1845   Vpon his face an Ocean of salt teares,
1846   To tell my loue vnto his dumbe deafe trunke,
1847   And with my fingers feele his hand, vnfeeling:
1848   But all in vaine are these meane Obsequies,
1849   <D {Bed put forth}.>
1850   And to suruey his dead and earthy Image:
1851   What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
1852  *<S {Warw}.> Come hither gracious Soueraigne, view this
1853   body.
1854   <S {King}.> That is to see how deepe my graue is made,
1855   For with his soule fled all my worldly solace:
1856   For seeing him, I see my life in death.
1857   <S {War}.> As surely as my soule intends to liue
1858   With that dread King that tooke our state vpon him,
1859   To free vs from his Fathers wrathfull curse,
1860   I do beleeue that violent hands were laid
1861   Vpon the life of this thrice- famed Duke.
1862  *<S {Suf}.> A dreadfull Oath, sworne with a solemn tongue:
1863   What instance giues Lord Warwicke for his vow.
1864   <S {War}.> See how the blood is setled in his face.
1865   Oft haue I seene a timely- parted Ghost,
1866   Of ashy semblance, meager, pale, and bloodlesse,
1867   Being all descended to the labouring heart,
1868   Who in the Conflict that it holds with death,
1869   Attracts the same for aydance 'gainst the enemy,
1870   Which with the heart there cooles, and ne're returneth,
1871   To blush and beautifie the Cheeke againe.
1872   But see, his face is blacke, and full of blood:
1873   His eye- balles further out, than when he liued,
1874   Staring full gastly, like a strangled man:
1875   His hayre vprear'd, his nostrils stretcht with strugling:
1876   His hands abroad display'd, as one that graspt
1877   And tugg'd for Life, and was by strength subdude.
1878   Looke on the sheets his haire (you see) is sticking,
1879   His well proportion'd Beard, made ruffe and rugged,
1880   Like to the Summers Corne by Tempest lodged:
1881   It cannot be but he was murdred heere,
1882   The least of all these signes were probable.
1883  *<S {Suf}.> Why Warwicke, who should do the D[uke]. to death?
1884   My selfe and {Beauford} had him in protection,
1885   And we I hope sir, are no murtherers.
1886  *<S {War}.> But both of you were vowed D[uke]. Humfries foes,
1887   And you (forsooth) had the good Duke to keepe:
1888   Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,
1889   And 'tis well seene, he found an enemy.
1890   <S {Queen}.> Than you belike suspect these Noblemen,
1891   As guilty of Duke {Humfries} timelesse death.
      <P n4><C A>
1892  *<S {Warw}.> Who finds the Heyfer dead, and bleeding fresh,
1893   And sees fast- by, a Butcher with an Axe,
1894   But will suspect, 'twas he that made the slaughter?
1895   Who finds the Partridge in the Puttocks Nest,
1896   But may imagine how the Bird was dead,
1897   Although the Kyte soare with vnbloudied Beake?
1898   Euen so suspitious is this Tragedie.
1899  *<S {Qu}.> Are you the Butcher, {Suffolk}? where's your Knife?
1900   Is {Beauford} tearm'd a Kyte? where are his Tallons?
1901   <S {Suff}.> I weare no Knife, to slaughter sleeping men,
1902   But here's a vengefull Sword, rusted with ease,
1903   That shall be scowred in his rancorous heart,
1904   That slanders me with Murthers Crimson Badge.
1905   Say, if thou dar'st, prowd Lord of Warwickshire,
1906   That I am faultie in Duke {Humfreyes} death.
1907  *<S {Warw}.> What dares not {Warwick}, if false {Suffolke} dare
1908   him?
1909   <S {Qu}.>  He dares not calme his contumelious Spirit,
1910   Nor cease to be an arrogant Controller,
1911   Though {Suffolke} dare him twentie thousand times.
1912   <S {Warw}.> Madame be still: with reuerence may I say,
1913   For euery word you speake in his behalfe,
1914   Is slander to your Royall Dignitie.
1915   <S {Suff}.> Blunt- witted Lord, ignoble in demeanor,
1916   If euer Lady wrong'd her Lord so much,
1917   Thy Mother tooke into her blamefull Bed
1918   Some sterne vntutur'd Churle; and Noble Stock
1919   Was graft with Crab- tree slippe, whose Fruit thou art,
1920   And neuer of the {Neuils} Noble Race.
1921   <S {Warw}.> But that the guilt of Murther bucklers thee,
1922   And I should rob the Deaths- man of his Fee,
1923   Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
1924   And that my Soueraignes presence makes me milde,
1925   I would, false murd'rous Coward, on thy Knee
1926   Make thee begge pardon for thy passed speech,
1927   And say, it was thy Mother that thou meant'st,
1928   That thou thy selfe wast borne in Bastardie;
1929   And after all this fearefull Homage done,
1930   Giue thee thy hyre, and send thy Soule to #Hell,
1931   Pernicious blood- sucker of sleeping men.
1932   <S {Suff}.> Thou shalt be waking, while I shed thy blood,
1933   If from this presence thou dar'st goe with me.
1934   <S {Warw}.> Away euen now, or I will drag thee hence:
1935   Vnworthy though thou art, Ile cope with thee,
1936   And doe some seruice to Duke {Humfreyes} Ghost.
1937   <D {Exeunt}.>
1938  *<S {King}.> What stronger Brest- plate then a heart vntainted?
1939   Thrice is he arm'd, that hath his Quarrell iust;
1940   And he but naked, though lockt vp in Steele,
1941   Whose Conscience with Iniustice is corrupted.
1942   <D {A noyse within}.>
1943   <S {Queene}.> What noyse is this?
1944   <D {Enter Suffolke and Warwicke, with their}
1945   {Weapons drawne}.>
1946   <S {King}.> Why how now Lords?
1947   Your wrathfull Weapons drawne,
1948   Here in our presence? Dare you be so bold?
1949   Why what tumultuous clamor haue we here?
1950   <S {Suff}.> The trayt'rous {Warwick}, with the men of Bury,
1951   Set all vpon me, mightie Soueraigne.
1952   <D {Enter Salisbury}.>
1953  *<S {Salisb}.> Sirs stand apart, the King shall know your
1954   minde.
1955   Dread Lord, the Commons send you word by me,
1956   Vnlesse Lord {Suffolke} straight be done to death,
1957   Or banished faire Englands Territories,
1958   They will by violence teare him from your Pallace,
1959   And torture him with grieuous lingring death.
1960   They say, by him the good Duke {Humfrey} dy'de:
1961   They say, in him they feare your Highnesse death;
1962   And meere instinct of Loue and Loyaltie,
1963   Free from a stubborne opposite intent,
1964   As being thought to contradict your liking,
1965   Makes them thus forward in his Banishment.
1966   They say, in care of your most Royall Person,
1967   That if your Highnesse should intend to sleepe,
1968   And charge, that no man should disturbe your rest,
1969   In paine of your dislike, or paine of death;
1970   Yet not withstanding such a strait Edict,
1971   Were there a Serpent seene, with forked Tongue,
1972   That slyly glyded towards your Maiestie,
1973   It were but necessarie you were wak't:
1974   Least being suffer'd in that harmefull slumber,
1975   The mortall Worme might make the sleepe eternall.
1976   And therefore doe they cry, though you forbid,
1977   That they will guard you, #where you will, or no,
1978   From such fell Serpents as false {Suffolke} is;
1979   With whose inuenomed and fatall sting,
1980   Your louing Vnckle, twentie times his worth,
1981   They say is shamefully bereft of life.
1982  *<S {Commons within}.> An answer from the King, my Lord
1983   of Salisbury.
1984   <S {Suff}.> 'Tis like the Commons, rude vnpolisht Hindes,
1985   Could send such Message to their Soueraigne:
1986   But you, my Lord, were glad to be imploy'd,
1987   To shew how queint an Orator you are.
1988   But all the Honor {Salisbury} hath wonne,
1989   Is, that he was the Lord Embassador,
1990   Sent from a sort of Tinkers to the King.
1991  *<S {Within}.> An answer from the King, or wee will all
1992   breake in.
1993   <S {King}.> Goe {Salisbury}, and tell them all from me,
1994   I thanke them for their tender louing care;
1995   And had I not beene cited so by them,
1996   Yet did I purpose as they doe entreat:
1997   For sure, my thoughts doe hourely prophecie,
1998   Mischance vnto my State by {Suffolkes} meanes.
1999   And therefore by his Maiestie I sweare,
2000   Whose farre- vnworthie Deputie I am,
2001   He shall not breathe infection in this ayre,
2002   But three dayes longer, on the paine of death.
2003   <S {Qu}.> Oh {Henry}, let me pleade for gentle {Suffolke}.
2004   <S {King}.> Vngentle Queene, to call him gentle {Suffolke}.
2005   No more I say: if thou do'st pleade for him,
2006   Thou wilt but adde encrease vnto my Wrath.
2007   Had I but sayd, I would haue kept my Word;
2008   But when I sweare, it is irreuocable:
2009   If after three dayes space thou here bee'st found,
2010   On any ground that I am Ruler of,
2011   The World shall not be Ransome for thy Life.
2012   Come {Warwicke}, come good {Warwicke}, goe with mee,
2013   I haue great matters to impart to thee.  <D {Exit}.>
2014   <S {Qu}.> Mischance and Sorrow goe along with you,
2015   Hearts Discontent, and sowre Affliction,
2016   Be play- fellowes to keepe you companie:
2017   There's two of you, the Deuill make a third,
2018   And three- fold Vengeance tend vpon your steps.
2019   <S {Suff}.> Cease, gentle Queene, these Execrations,
2020   And let thy {Suffolke} take his heauie leaue.
      <P n4v><C B>
2021  *<S {Queen}.> Fye Coward woman, and soft harted wretch,
2022   Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy.
2023  *<S {Suf}.> A plague vpon them: wherefore should I cursse
2024   them?
2025   Would curses kill, as doth the Mandrakes grone,
2026   I would inuent as bitter searching termes,
2027   As curst, as harsh, and horrible to heare,
2028   Deliuer'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
2029   With full as many signes of deadly hate,
2030   As leane- fac'd enuy in her loathsome caue.
2031   My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,
2032   Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten Flint,
2033   Mine haire be fixt #an end, as one distract:
2034   #I, euery ioynt should seeme to curse and ban,
2035   And euen now my burthen'd heart would breake
2036   Should I not curse them. Poyson be their drinke.
2037   Gall, worse then Gall, the daintiest that they taste:
2038   Their sweetest shade, a groue of Cypresse Trees:
2039   Their cheefest Prospect, murd'ring Basiliskes:
2040   Their softest Touch, as smart as Lyzards stings:
2041   Their Musicke, frightfull as the Serpents hisse,
2042   And boading Screech- Owles, make the Consort full.
2043   All the foule terrors in darke seated #hell ===
2044  *<S {Q}.> Enough sweet Suffolke, thou torment'st thy selfe,
2045   And these dread curses like the Sunne 'gainst glasse,
2046   Or like an ouer- charged Gun, recoile,
2047   And turnes the force of them vpon thy selfe.
2048   <S {Suf}.> You bad me ban, and will you bid me leaue?
2049   Now by the ground that I am banish'd from,
2050   Well could I curse away a Winters night,
2051   Though standing naked on a Mountaine top,
2052   Where byting cold would neuer let grasse grow,
2053   And thinke it but a minute spent in sport.
2054   <S {Qu}.> Oh, let me intreat thee cease, giue me thy hand,
2055   That I may dew it with my mournfull teares:
2056   Nor let the raine of heauen wet this place,
2057   To wash away my wofull Monuments.
2058   Oh, could this kisse be printed in thy hand,
2059   That thou might'st thinke vpon these by the Seale,
2060  *Through whom a thousand sighes are breath'd for thee.
2061   So get thee gone, that I may know my greefe,
2062   'Tis but surmiz'd, whiles thou art standing by,
2063   As one that surfets, thinking on a want:
2064   I will repeale thee, or be well assur'd,
2065   Aduenture to be banished my  selfe:
2066   And banished I am, if but from thee.
2067   Go, speake not to me; euen now be gone.
2068   Oh go not yet. Euen thus, two Friends condemn'd,
2069   Embrace, and kisse, and take ten thousand leaues,
2070   Loather a hundred times to part then dye;
2071   Yet now farewell, and farewell Life with thee.
2072   <S {Suf}.> Thus is poore Suffolke ten times banished,
2073   Once by the King, and three times thrice by thee.
2074   'Tis not the Land I care for, wer't thou thence,
2075   A Wildernesse is populous enough,
2076   So Suffolke had thy heauenly company:
2077   For where thou art, there is the World it selfe,
2078   With euery seuerall pleasure in the World:
2079   And where thou art not, Desolation.
2080   I can no more: Liue thou to ioy thy life;
2081   My selfe no ioy in nought, but that thou liu'st.
2082   <D {Enter Vaux}.>
2083  *<S {Queene}.> Whether goes {Vaux} so fast? What newes I
2084   prethee?
2085   <S {Vaux}.> To signifie vnto his Maiesty,
2086   That Cardinal {Beauford} is at point of death:
2087   For sodainly a greeuous sicknesse tooke him,
2088   That makes him gaspe, and stare, and catch the aire,
2089   Blaspheming God, and cursing men on earth.
2090   Sometime he talkes, as if Duke {Humfries} Ghost
2091   Were by his side: Sometime, he calles the King,
2092   And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
2093   The secrets of his ouer- charged soule,
2094   And I am sent to tell his Maiestie,
2095   That euen now he cries alowd for him.
2096   <S {Qu}.> Go tell this heauy Message to the King.  <D {Exit}>
2097   Aye me! What is this World? What newes are these?
2098   But wherefore greeue I at an houres poore losse,
2099   Omitting Suffolkes exile, my soules Treasure?
2100   Why onely Suffolke mourne I not for thee?
2101   And with the Southerne clouds, contend in teares?
2102   Theirs for the earths encrease, mine for my sorrowes.
2103  *Now get thee hence, the King thou know'st is comming,
2104   If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.
2105   <S {Suf}.> If I depart from thee, I cannot liue,
2106   And in thy sight to dye, what were it else,
2107   But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
2108   Heere could I breath my soule into the ayre,
2109   As milde and gentle as the Cradle- babe,
2110   Dying with mothers dugge betweene it's lips.
2111   Where from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
2112   And cry out for thee to close vp mine eyes:
2113   To haue thee with thy lippes to stop my mouth:
2114   So should'st thou eyther turne my flying soule,
2115   Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
2116   And then it liu'd in sweete Elizium.
2117   To dye by thee, were but to dye in iest,
2118   From thee to dye, were torture more then death:
2119   Oh let me stay, befall what may befall.
2120  *<S {Queen}.> Away: Though parting be a fretfull corosiue,
2121   It is applyed to a deathfull wound.
2122   To France sweet Suffolke: Let me heare from thee:
2123   For wheresoere thou art in this worlds Globe,
2124   Ile haue an {Iris} that shall finde thee out.
2125   <S {Suf}.> I go.
2126   <S {Qu}.> And take my heart with thee.
2127   <S {Suf}.> A Iewell lockt into the wofulst Caske,
2128   That euer did containe a thing of worth,
2129   Euen as a splitted Barke, so sunder we:
2130   This way fall I to death.
2131   <S {Qu}.> This way for me.  <D {Exeunt}>
2132   <D {Enter the King, Salisbury, and Warwicke, to the}
2133   {Cardinal in bed}.>
2134  *<S {King}.> How fare's my Lord? Speake {Beauford} to thy
2135   Soueraigne.
2136  *<S {Ca}.> If thou beest death, Ile giue thee Englands Treasure,
2137   Enough to purchase such another Island,
2138   So thou wilt let me liue, and feele no paine.
2139   <S {King}.> Ah, what a signe it is of euill life,
2140   Where death's approach is seene so terrible.
2141   <S {War}.> {Beauford}, it is thy Soueraigne speakes to thee.
2142   <S {Beau}.> Bring me vnto my Triall when you will.
2143   Dy'de he not in his bed? Where should he dye?
2144   Can I make men liue #where they will or no?
2145   Oh torture me no more, I will confesse.
2146   Aliue againe? Then shew me where he is,
2147   Ile giue a thousand pound to looke vpon him.
2148   He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
      <P n5>
2149  *Combe downe his haire; looke, looke, it stands vpright,
2150   Like Lime- twigs set to catch my winged soule:
2151   Giue me some drinke, and bid the Apothecarie
2152   Bring the strong poyson that I bought of him.
2153   <S {King}.> Oh thou eternall mouer of the heauens,
2154   Looke with a gentle eye vpon this Wretch,
2155   Oh beate away the busie medling Fiend,
2156   That layes strong siege vnto this wretches soule,
2157   And from his bosome purge this blacke dispaire.
2158   <S {War}.> See how the pangs of death do make him grin.
2159   <S {Sal}.> Disturbe him not, let him passe peaceably.
2160   <S {King}.> Peace to his soule, if Gods good pleasure be.
2161   Lord Card'nall, if thou think'st on heauens blisse,
2162   Hold vp thy hand, make signall of thy hope.
2163   He dies and makes no signe: Oh God forgiue him.
2164   <S {War}.> So bad a death, argues a monstrous life.
2165   <S {King}.> Forbeare to iudge, for we are sinners all.
2166   Close vp his eyes, and draw the Curtaine close,
2167   And let vs all to Meditation.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2168   <D {Alarum. Fight at Sea. Ordnance goes off}.>
2169   <D {Enter Lieutenant, Suffolke, and others}.>
2170   <S {Lieu}.> The gaudy blabbing and remorsefull day,
2171   Is crept into the bosome of the Sea:
2172   And now loud houling Wolues arouse the Iades
2173   That dragge the Tragicke melancholy night:
2174   Who with their drowsie, slow, and flagging wings
2175   Cleape dead- mens graues, and from their misty Iawes,
2176   Breath foule contagious darknesse in the ayre:
2177   Therefore bring forth the Souldiers of our prize,
2178   For whilst our Pinnace Anchors in the Downes,
2179   Heere shall  they make their ransome on the sand,
2180   Or with their blood staine this discoloured shore.
2181   Maister, this Prisoner freely giue I thee,
2182   And thou that art his Mate, make boote of this:
2183   The other {Walter Whitmore} is thy share.
2184   <S 1.{Gent}.> What is my ransome Master, let me know.
2185  *<S {Ma}.> A thousand Crownes, or else lay down your head
2186  *<S {Mate}.> And so much shall you giue, or off goes yours.
2187  *<S {Lieu}.> What thinke you much to pay 2000. Crownes,
2188   And beare the name and port of Gentlemen?
2189   Cut both the Villaines throats, for dy you shall:
2190   The liues of those which we haue lost in fight,
2191   Be counter- poys'd with such a pettie summe.
2192   <S 1.{Gent}.> Ile giue it sir, and therefore spare my life.
2193   <S 2.{Gent}.> And so will I, and write home for it straight.
2194   <S {Whitm}.> I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboord,
2195   And therefore to reuenge it, shalt thou dye,
2196   And so should these, if I might haue my #will.
2197   <S {Lieu}.> Be not so rash, take ransome, let him liue.
2198   <S {Suf}.> Looke on my George, I am a Gentleman,
2199   Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be payed.
2200   <S {Whit}.> And so am I: my name is {Walter Whitmore}.
2201   How now? why starts thou? What doth death affright?
2202  *<S {Suf}.> Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death:
2203   A cunning man did calculate my birth,
2204   And told me that by Water I should dye:
2205   Yet let not this make thee be bloody- minded,
2206   Thy name is {Gualtier}, being rightly sounded.
2207   <S {Whit}.> {Gualtier} or {Walter}, which it is I care not,
2208   Neuer yet did base dishonour blurre our name,
2209   But with our sword we wip'd away the blot.
2210   Therefore, when Merchant- like I sell reuenge,
2211   Broke be my sword, my Armes torne and defac'd,
2212   And I proclaim'd a Coward through the world.
2213   <S {Suf}.> Stay {Whitmore}, for thy Prisoner is a Prince,
2214   The Duke of Suffolke, {William de la Pole}.
2215   <S {Whit}.> The Duke of Suffolke, muffled vp in ragges?
2216   <S {Suf}.> #I, but these ragges are no part of the Duke.
2217   <S {Lieu}.> But Ioue was neuer slaine as thou shalt be,
2218   Obscure and lowsie Swaine, King {Henries} blood.
2219   <S {Suf}.> The honourable blood of Lancaster
2220   Must not be shed by such a iaded Groome:
2221   Hast thou not kist thy hand, and held my stirrop?
2222   Bare- headed plodded by my foot- cloth Mule,
2223   And thought thee happy when I shooke my head.
2224   How often hast thou waited at my cup,
2225   Fed from my Trencher, kneel'd downe at the boord,
2226   When I haue feasted with Queene {Margaret}?
2227   Remember it, and let it make thee Crest- falne,
2228   #I, and alay this thy abortiue Pride:
2229   How in our voyding Lobby hast thou stood,
2230   And duly wayted for my comming forth?
2231   This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalfe,
2232   And therefore shall it charme thy riotous tongue.
2233  *<S {Whit}.> Speak Captaine, shall I stab the forlorn Swain.
2234   <S {Lieu}.> First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
2235   <S {Suf}.> Base slaue, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
2236   <S {Lieu}.> Conuey him hence, and on our long boats side,
2237   Strike off his head. <S {Suf}.> Thou dar'st not for thy owne.
2238   <S {Lieu}.> {Poole}, Sir {Poole}? Lord,
2239   #I kennell, puddle, sinke, whose filth and dirt
2240   Troubles the siluer Spring, where England drinkes:
2241   Now will I dam vp this thy yawning mouth,
2242   For swallowing the Treasure of the Realme.
2243  *Thy lips that kist the Queene, shall sweepe the ground:
2244   And thou that smil'dst at good Duke {Humfries} death,
2245   Against the senselesse windes shall grin in vaine,
2246   Who in contempt shall hisse at thee againe.
2247   And wedded be thou to the Hagges of #hell,
2248   For daring to affye a mighty Lord
2249   Vnto the daughter of a worthlesse King,
2250   Hauing neyther Subiect, Wealth, nor Diadem:
2251   By diuellish policy art thou growne great,
2252   And like ambitious Sylla ouer- gorg'd,
2253   With gobbets of thy Mother- bleeding heart.
2254   By thee {Aniou} and {Maine} were sold to France.
2255   The false reuolting Normans thorough thee,
2256   Disdaine to call vs Lord, and {Piccardie}
2257   Hath slaine their Gouernors, surpriz'd our Forts,
2258   And sent the ragged Souldiers wounded home.
2259   The Princely Warwicke, and the {Neuils} all,
2260   Whose dreadfull swords were neuer drawne in vaine,
2261   As hating thee, and rising vp in armes.
2262   And now the House of Yorke thrust from the Crowne,
2263   By shamefull murther of a guiltlesse King,
2264   And lofty proud incroaching tyranny,
2265   Burnes with reuenging fire, whose hopefull colours
2266   Aduance our halfe- fac'd Sunne, striuing to shine;
2267   Vnder the which is writ, {Inuitis nubibus}.
2268   The Commons heere in Kent are vp in armes,
2269   And to conclude, Reproach and Beggerie,
2270   Is crept into the Pallace of our King,
2271   And all by thee: away, conuey him hence.
2272   <S {Suf}.> O that I were a God, to shoot forth Thunder
2273   Vpon these paltry, seruile, abiect Drudges:
2274  *Small things make base men proud. This Villaine heere,
2275   Being Captaine of a Pinnace, threatens more
2276   Then {Bargulus} the strong Illyrian Pyrate.
2277   Drones sucke not Eagles blood, but rob Bee- hiues:
2278   It is impossible that I should dye
      <P n5v>
2279   By such a lowly Vassall as thy selfe.
2280   Thy words moue Rage, and not remorse in me:
2281   I go of Message from the Queene to France:
2282   I charge thee waft me safely crosse the Channell.
2283  *<S {Lieu}.> Water: <S #W.> Come Suffolke, I must waft thee
2284   to thy death.
2285   <S {Suf}.> {Pine gelidus timor occupat artus}, it is thee I feare.
2286  *<S {Wal}.> Thou shalt haue cause to feare before I leaue thee.
2287   What, are ye danted now? Now will ye stoope.
2288  *<S 1.{Gent}.> My gracious Lord intreat him, speak him fair.
2289   <S {Suf}.> Suffolkes Imperiall tongue is sterne and rough:
2290   Vs'd to command, vntaught to pleade for fauour.
2291   Farre be it, we should honor such as these
2292   With humble suite: no, rather let my head
2293   Stoope to the blocke, then these knees bow to any,
2294   Saue to the God of heauen, and to my King:
2295   And sooner dance vpon a bloody pole,
2296   Then stand vncouer'd to the Vulgar Groome.
2297   True Nobility, is exempt from feare:
2298   More can I beare, then you dare execute.
2299   <S {Lieu}.> Hale him away, and let him talke no more:
2300   Come Souldiers, shew what cruelty ye can.
2301   <S {Suf}.> That this my death may neuer be forgot.
2302   Great men oft dye by vilde Bezonions.
2303   A Romane Sworder, and Bandetto slaue
2304   Murder'd sweet {Tully}. {Brutus} Bastard hand
2305   Stab'd {Iulius Caesar}. Sauage Islanders
2306   {Pompey} the Great, and {Suffolke} dyes by Pyrats.
2307   <D {Exit Water with Suffolke}.>
2308   <S {Lieu}.> And as for these whose ransome we haue set,
2309   It is our pleasure one of them depart:
2310   Therefore come you with vs, and let him go.
2311   <D {Exit Lieutenant, and the rest}.>
2312   <D {Manet the first Gent. Enter Walter with the body}.>
2313   <S {Wal}.> There let his head, and liuelesse bodie lye,
2314   Vntill the Queene his Mistris bury it.  <D {Exit Walter}.>
2315   <S 1.{Gent}.> O barbarous and bloudy spectacle,
2316   His body will I beare vnto the King:
2317   If he reuenge it not, yet will his Friends,
2318   So will the Queene, that liuing, held him deere.
2319   <D {Enter Beuis, and Iohn Holland}.>
2320  *<S {Beuis}.> Come and get thee a sword, though made of a
2321   Lath, they haue bene vp these two dayes.
2322   <S {Hol}.> They haue the more neede to sleepe now then.
2323  *<S {Beuis}.> I tell thee, {Iacke Cade} the Cloathier, meanes to
2324  *dresse the Common- wealth and turne it, and set a new
2325   nap vpon it.
2326  *<S {Hol}.> So he had need, for 'tis thred- bare. Well, I say,
2327  *it was neuer merrie world in England, since Gentlemen
2328   came vp.
2329  *<S {Beuis}.> O miserable Age: Vertue is not regarded in
2330   Handy- crafts men.
2331  *<S {Hol}.> The Nobilitie thinke scorne to goe in Leather
2332   Aprons.
2333  *<S {Beuis}.> Nay more, the Kings Councell are no good
2334   Workemen.
2335  *<S {Hol}.> True: and yet it is said, Labour in thy Vocati-on:
2336  *which is as much to say, as let the Magistrates be la-bouring
2337   men, and therefore should we be Magistrates.
2338  *<S {Beuis}.> Thou hast hit it: for there's no better signe of a
2339   braue minde, then a hard hand.
2340  *<S {Hol}.> I see them, I see them: There's {Bests} Sonne, the
2341   Tanner of Wingham.
2342  *<S {Beuis}.> Hee shall haue the skinnes of our enemies, to
2343   make Dogges Leather of.
2344   <S {Hol}.> And Dicke the Butcher.
2345  *<S {Beuis}.> Then is sin strucke downe like an Oxe, and ini-quities
2346   throate cut like a Calfe.
2347   <S {Hol}.> And Smith the Weauer.
2348   <S {Beu}.> Argo, their thred of life is spun.
2349   <S {Hol}.> Come, come, let's fall in with them.
2350  *<D {Drumme. Enter Cade, Dicke Butcher, Smith the Weauer},
2351   {and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers}.>
2352  *<S {Cade}.> Wee {Iohn Cade}, so tearm'd of our supposed Fa-ther.
2353  _
2354   <S {But}.> Or rather of stealing a Cade of Herrings.
2355  *<S {Cade}.> For our enemies shall faile before vs, inspired
2356  *with the spirit of putting down Kings and Princes. Com-mand
2357   silence.
2358   <S {But}.> Silence.
2359   <S {Cade}.> My Father was a {Mortimer}.
2360   <S {But}.> He was an honest man, and a good Bricklayer.
2361   <S {Cade}.> My mother a {Plantagenet}.
2362   <S {Butch}.> I knew her well, she was a Midwife.
2363   <S {Cade}.> My wife descended of the {Lacies}.
2364  *<S {But}.> She was indeed a Pedlers daughter, & sold many
2365   Laces.
2366  *<S {Weauer}.> But now of late, not able to trauell with her
2367   furr'd Packe, she washes buckes here at home.
2368   <S {Cade}.> Therefore am I of an honorable house.
2369  *<S {But}.> #I by my faith, the field is honourable, and there
2370  *was he borne, vnder a hedge: for his Father had neuer a
2371   house but the Cage.
2372   <S {Cade}.> Valiant I am.
2373   <S {Weauer}.> #A must needs, for beggery is valiant.
2374   <S {Cade}.> I am able to endure much.
2375  *<S {But}.> No question of that: for I haue seene him whipt
2376   three Market dayes together.
2377   <S {Cade}.> I feare neither sword, nor fire.
2378  *<S {Wea}.> He neede not feare the sword, for his Coate is of
2379   proofe.
2380  *<S {But}.> But me thinks he should stand in feare of fire, be-ing
2381   burnt i'th hand for stealing of Sheepe.
2382  *<S {Cade}.> Be braue then, for your Captaine is Braue, and
2383  *Vowes Reformation. There shall be in England, seuen
2384  *halfe peny Loaues sold for a peny: the three hoop'd pot,
2385  *shall haue ten hoopes, and I wil make it Fellony to drink
2386  *small Beere. All the Realme shall be in Common, and in
2387  *Cheapside shall my Palfrey go to grasse: and when I am
2388   King, as King I will be.
2389   <S {All}.> God saue your Maiesty.
2390  *<S {Cade}.> I thanke you good people. There shall bee no
2391  *mony, all shall eate and drinke on my score, and I will
2392  *apparrell them all in one Liuery, that they may agree like
2393   Brothers, and worship me their Lord.
2394   <S {But}.> The first thing we do, let's kill all the Lawyers.
2395  *<S {Cade}.> Nay, that I meane to do. Is not this a lamenta-ble
2396  *thing, that of the skin of an innocent Lambe should
2397  *be made Parchment; that Parchment being scribeld ore,
2398  *should vndoe a man. Some say the #Bee stings, but I say,
2399  *'tis the Bees waxe: for I did but seale once to a thing, and
2400  *I was neuer mine owne man since. How now? Who's
2401   there?
2402   <D {Enter a Clearke}.>
2403  *<S {Weauer}.> The Clearke of Chartam: hee can write and
2404   reade, and cast accompt.
2405   <S {Cade}.> O monstrous.
2406   <S {Wea}.> We tooke him setting of boyes Copies.
      <P n6>
2407   <S {Cade}.> Here's a Villaine.
2408  *<S {Wea}.> #Ha's a Booke in his pocket with red Letters in't
2409   <S {Cade}.> Nay then he is a Coniurer.
2410  *<S {But}.> Nay, he can make Obligations, and write Court
2411   hand.
2412  *<S {Cade}.> I am sorry for't: The man is a proper man of
2413  *mine Honour: vnlesse I finde him guilty he shall not die.
2414  *Come hither sirrah, I must examine thee: What is thy
2415   name?
2416   <S {Clearke}.> {Emanuell}.
2417  *<S {But}.> They vse to writ it on the top of Letters: 'Twill
2418   go hard with you.
2419  *<S {Cade}.> Let me alone: Dost thou vse to write thy name?
2420  *Or hast thou a marke to thy selfe, like a honest plain dea-ling
2421   man?
2422  *<S {Clearke}.> Sir I thanke God, I haue bin so well brought
2423   vp, that I can write my name.
2424  *<S {All}.> He hath confest: away with him: he's a Villaine
2425   and a Traitor.
2426  *<S {Cade}.> Away with him I say: Hang him with his Pen
2427   and Inke- horne about his necke.
2428   <D {Exit one with the Clearke}>
2429   <D {Enter Michael}.>
2430   <S {Mich}.> Where's our Generall?
2431   <S {Cade}.> Heere I am thou particular fellow.
2432  *<S {Mich}.> Fly, fly, fly, Sir {Humfrey Stafford} and his brother
2433   are hard by, with the Kings Forces.
2434  *<S {Cade}.> Stand villaine, stand, or Ile fell thee downe: he
2435  *shall be encountred with a man as good as himselfe. He
2436   is but a Knight, is #a?
2437   <S {Mich}.> No.
2438  *<S {Cade}.> To equall him I will make my selfe a knight, pre-sently;
2439   Rise vp Sir {Iohn Mortimer}. Now haue at him.
2440   <D {Enter Sir Humfrey Stafford, and his Brother},
2441   {with Drum and Soldiers}.>
2442   <S {Staf}.> Rebellious Hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
2443   Mark'd for the Gallowes: Lay your Weapons downe,
2444   Home to your Cottages: forsake this Groome.
2445   The King is mercifull, if you reuolt.
2446   <S {Bro}.> But angry, wrathfull, and inclin'd to blood,
2447   If you go forward: therefore yeeld, or dye.
2448   <S {Cade}.> As for these silken- coated slaues I passe not,
2449   It is to you good people, that I speake,
2450   Ouer whom (in time to come) I hope to raigne:
2451   For I am rightfull heyre vnto the Crowne.
2452   <S {Staff}.> Villaine, thy Father was a Playsterer,
2453   And thou thy selfe a Sheareman, art thou not?
2454   <S {Cade}.> And {Adam} was a Gardiner.
2455   <S {Bro}.> And what of that?
2456  *<S {Cade}.> Marry, this {Edmund Mortimer} Earle of March,
2457   married the Duke of {Clarence} daughter, did he not?
2458   <S {Staf}.> #I sir.
2459   <S {Cade}.> By her he had two children at one birth.
2460   <S {Bro}.> That's false.
2461   <S {Cade}.> #I, there's the question; But I say, 'tis true:
2462   The elder of them being put to nurse,
2463   Was by a begger- woman stolne away,
2464   And ignorant of his birth and parentage,
2465   Became a Bricklayer, when he came to age.
2466   His sonne am I, deny it if you can.
2467   <S {But}.> Nay, 'tis too true, therefore he shall be King.
2468  *<S {Wea}.> Sir, he made a Chimney in my Fathers house, &
2469  *the brickes are aliue at this day to testifie it: therefore
2470   deny it not.
2471  *<S {Staf}.> And will you credit this base Drudges Wordes,
2472   that speakes he knowes not what.
2473   <S {All}.> #I marry will we: therefore get ye gone.
2474  *<S {Bro}.> {Iacke Cade}, the D[uke]. of York hath taught you this.
2475  *<S {Cade}.> He lyes, for I inuented it my selfe. Go #too Sir-rah,
2476  *tell the King from me, that for his Fathers sake {Hen-ry}
2477  *the fift, (in whose time, boyes went to Span- counter
2478  *for French Crownes) I am content he shall raigne, but Ile
2479   be Protector ouer him.
2480  *<S {Butcher}.> And furthermore, wee'l haue the Lord {Sayes}
2481   head, for selling the Dukedome of {Maine}.
2482  *<S {Cade}> And good reason: for thereby is England main'd
2483  *And faine to go with a staffe, but that my puissance holds
2484  *it vp. Fellow- Kings, I tell you, that that Lord {Say} hath
2485  *gelded the Commonwealth, and made it an Eunuch: &
2486  *more then that, he can speake French, and therefore hee is
2487   a Traitor.
2488   <S {Staf}.> O grosse and miserable ignorance.
2489  *<S {Cade}.> Nay answer if you can: The Frenchmen are our
2490  *enemies: go #too then, I ask but this: Can he that speaks
2491  *with the tongue of an enemy, be a good Councellour, or
2492   no?
2493   <S {All}.> No, no, and therefore wee'l haue his head.
2494   <S {Bro}.> Well, seeing gentle words will not preuayle,
2495   Assaile them with the Army of the King.
2496   <S {Staf}.> Herald away, and throughout euery Towne,
2497   Proclaime them Traitors that are vp with {Cade},
2498   That those which flye before the battell ends,
2499   May euen in their Wiues and Childrens sight,
2500   Be hang'd vp for example at their doores:
2501   And you that be the Kings Friends follow me.  <D {Exit}.>
2502   <S {Cade}.> And you that loue the Commons, follow me:
2503   Now shew your selues men, 'tis for Liberty.
2504   We will not leaue one Lord, one Gentleman:
2505   Spare none, but such as go in clouted shooen,
2506   For they are thrifty honest men, and such
2507   As would (but that they dare not) take our parts.
2508   <S {But}.> They are all in order, and march toward vs.
2509  *<S {Cade}.> But then are we in order, when we are most out
2510   of order. Come, march forward.
2511   <D {Alarums to the fight, wherein both the Staffords are slaine}.
2512   {Enter Cade and the rest}.>
2513   <S {Cade}.> Where's Dicke, the Butcher of Ashford?
2514   <S {But}.> Heere sir.
2515  *<S {Cade}.> They fell before thee like Sheepe and Oxen, &
2516  *thou behaued'st thy selfe, as if thou hadst beene in thine
2517  *owne Slaughter- house: Therfore thus will I reward thee,
2518  *the Lent shall bee as long againe as it is, and thou shalt
2519   haue a License to kill for a hundred lacking one.
2520   <S {But}.> I desire no more.
2521   <S {Cade}.> And to speake truth, thou deseru'st no lesse.
2522  *This Monument of the victory will I beare, and the bo-dies
2523  *shall be dragg'd at my horse heeles, till I do come to
2524  *London, where we will haue the Maiors sword born be-fore
2525   vs.
2526  *<S {But}.> If we meane to thriue, and do good, breake open
2527   the Gaoles, and let out the Prisoners.
2528  *<S {Cade}.> Feare not that I warrant thee. Come, let's march
2529   towards London.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2530  *<D {Enter the King with a Supplication, and the Queene with Suf-folkes}
2531   {head, the Duke of Buckingham, and the}
2532   {Lord Say}.>
2533  *<S {Queene}.> Oft haue I heard that greefe softens the mind,
      <P n6v>
2534   And makes it fearefull and degenerate,
2535   Thinke therefore on reuenge, and cease to weepe.
2536   But who can cease to weepe, and looke on this.
2537   Heere may his head lye on my throbbing brest:
2538   But where's the body that I should imbrace?
2539  *<S {Buc}.> What answer makes your Grace to the Rebells
2540   Supplication?
2541   <S {King}.> Ile send some holy Bishop to intreat:
2542   For God forbid, so many simple soules
2543   Should perish by the Sword. And I my selfe,
2544   Rather then bloody Warre shall cut them short,
2545   Will parley with {Iacke Cade} their Generall.
2546   But stay, Ile read it ouer once againe.
2547   <S {Qu}.> Ah barbarous villaines: Hath this louely face,
2548   Rul'd like a wandering Plannet ouer me,
2549   And could it not inforce them to relent,
2550   That were vnworthy to behold the same.
2551   <S {King}.> Lord {Say}, {Iacke Cade} hath sworne to haue thy
2552   head.
2553   <S {Say}.> #I, but I hope your Highnesse shall haue his.
2554   <S {King}.> How now Madam?
2555   Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolkes death?
2556   I feare me (Loue) if that I had beene dead,
2557   Thou would'st not haue mourn'd so much for me.
2558  *<S {Qu}.> No my Loue, I should not mourne, but dye for
2559   thee.
2560   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2561  *<S {King}.> How now? What newes? Why com'st thou in
2562   such haste?
2563   <S {Mes}.> The Rebels are in Southwarke: Fly my Lord:
2564   {Iacke Cade} proclaimes himselfe Lord {Mortimer},
2565   Descended from the Duke of {Clarence} house,
2566   And calles your Grace Vsurper, openly,
2567   And vowes to Crowne himselfe in Westminster.
2568   His Army is a ragged multitude
2569   Of Hindes and Pezants, rude and mercilesse:
2570   Sir {Humfrey Stafford}, and his Brothers death,
2571   Hath giuen them heart and courage to proceede:
2572   All Schollers, Lawyers, Courtiers, Gentlemen,
2573   They call false Catterpillers, and intend their death.
2574  *<S {Kin}.> Oh gracelesse men: they know not what they do.
2575   <S {Buck}.> My gracious Lord, retire to Killingworth,
2576   Vntill a power be rais'd to put them downe.
2577   <S {Qu}.> Ah were the Duke of Suffolke now aliue,
2578   These Kentish Rebels would be soone appeas'd.
2579   <S {King}.> Lord {Say}, the Traitors hateth thee,
2580   Therefore away with vs to Killingworth.
2581   <S {Say}.> So might your Graces person be in danger.
2582   The sight of me is odious in their eyes:
2583   And therefore in this Citty will I stay,
2584   And liue alone as secret as I may.
2585   <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
2586   <S {Mess}.> {Iacke Cade} hath gotten London- bridge.
2587   The Citizens flye and forsake their houses:
2588   The Rascall people, thirsting after prey,
2589   Ioyne with the Traitor, and they ioyntly sweare
2590   To spoyle the City, and your Royall Court.
2591   <S {Buc}.> Then linger not my Lord, away, take horse.
2592  *<S {King}.> Come {Margaret}, God our hope will succor vs.
2593   <S {Qu}.> My hope is gone, now Suffolke is deceast.
2594  *<S {King}.> Farewell my Lord, trust not the Kentish Rebels
2595   <S {Buc}.> Trust no body for feare you betraid.
2596   <S {Say}.> The trust I haue, is in mine innocence,
2597   And therefore am I bold and resolute.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2598   <D {Enter Lord Scales vpon the Tower walking. Then enters}
2599   {two or three Citizens below}.>
2600   <S {Scales}.> How now? Is {Iacke Cade} slaine?
2601   <S 1.{Cit}.> No my Lord, nor likely to be slaine:
2602   For they haue wonne the Bridge,
2603   Killing all those that withstand them:
2604  *The L[ord]. Maior craues ayd of your Honor from the Tower
2605   To defend the City from the Rebels.
2606   <S {Scales}.> Such ayd as I can spare you shall command,
2607   But I am troubled heere with them my selfe,
2608   The Rebels haue assay'd to win the Tower.
2609   But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,
2610   And thither I will send you {Mathew Goffe}.
2611   Fight for your King, your Countrey, and your Liues,
2612   And so farwell, for I must hence againe.  <D {Exeunt}>
2613   <D {Enter Iacke Cade and the rest, and strikes his}
2614   {staffe on London stone}.>
2615   <S {Cade}.> Now is {Mortimer} Lord of this City,
2616   And heere sitting vpon London Stone,
2617   I charge and command, that of the Cities cost
2618   The pissing Conduit run nothing but Clarret Wine
2619   This first yeare of our raigne.
2620   And now henceforward it shall be Treason for any,
2621   That calles me other then Lord {Mortimer}.
2622   <D {Enter a Soldier running}.>
2623   <S {Soul}.> {Iacke Cade}, {Iacke Cade}.
2624   <S {Cade}.> Knocke him downe there.  <D {They kill him}.>
2625  *<S {But}.> If this Fellow be wise, hee'l neuer call yee {Iacke}
2626   {#Cade} more, I thinke he hath a very faire warning.
2627  *<S {Dicke}.> My Lord, there's an Army gathered together
2628   in Smithfield.
2629   <S {Cade}.> Come, then let's go fight with them:
2630   But first, go and set London Bridge on fire,
2631   And if you can, burne downe the Tower too.
2632   Come, let's away.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
2633   <D {Alarums. Mathew Goffe is slain, and all the rest}.
2634   {Then enter Iacke Cade, with his Company}.>
2635  *<S {Cade}.> So sirs: now go some and pull down the Sauoy:
2636   Others to'th Innes of Court, downe with them all.
2637   <S {But}.> I haue a suite vnto your Lordship.
2638  *<S {Cade}.> Bee it a Lordshippe, thou shalt haue it for that
2639   word.
2640  *<S {But}.> Onely that the Lawes of England may come out
2641   of your mouth.
2642  *<S {Iohn}.> Masse 'twill be sore Law then, for he was thrust
2643   in the mouth with a Speare, and 'tis not whole yet.
2644  *<S {Smith}.> Nay {Iohn}, it wil be stinking Law, for his breath
2645   stinkes with eating toasted cheese.
2646  *<S {Cade}.> I haue thought vpon it, it shall bee so. Away,
2647  *burne all the Records of the Realme, my mouth shall be
2648   the Parliament of England.
2649   <S {Iohn}.> Then we are like to haue biting Statutes
2650   Vnlesse his teeth be pull'd out.
2651  *<S {Cade}.> And hence- forward all things shall be in Com-mon.
2652   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2653  *<S {Mes}.> My Lord, a prize, a prize, heeres the Lord {Say},
2654  *which sold the Townes in France. He that made vs pay
2655  *one and twenty Fifteenes, and one shilling to the pound,
2656   the last Subsidie.
      <P o1>
2657   <D {Enter George, with the Lord Say}.>
2658  *<S {Cade}.> Well, hee shall be beheaded for it ten times:
2659  *Ah thou Say, thou Surge, nay thou Buckram Lord, now
2660  *art thou within point- blanke of our Iurisdiction Regall.
2661  *What canst thou answer to my Maiesty, for giuing vp of
2662  *Normandie vnto Mounsieur {Basimecu}, the Dolphine of
2663  *France? Be it knowne vnto thee by these presence, euen
2664  *the presence of Lord {Mortimer}, that I am the Beesome
2665  *that must sweepe the Court cleane of such filth as thou
2666  *art: Thou hast most traiterously corrupted the youth of
2667  *the Realme, in erecting a Grammar Schoole: and where-as
2668  *before, our Fore- fathers had no other Bookes but the
2669  *Score and the Tally, thou hast caused printing to be vs'd,
2670  *and contrary to the King, his Crowne, and Dignity, thou
2671  *hast built a Paper- Mill. It will be prooued to thy Face,
2672  *that thou hast men about thee, that vsually talke of a
2673  *Nowne and a Verbe, and such abhominable wordes, as
2674  *no Christian eare can endure to heare. Thou hast appoin-ted
2675  *Iustices of Peace, to call poore men before them, a-bout
2676  *matters they were not able to answer. Moreouer,
2677  *thou hast put them in prison, and because they could not
2678  *reade, thou hast hang'd them, when (indeede) onely for
2679  *that cause they haue beene most worthy to liue. Thou
2680   dost ride in a foot- cloth, dost thou not?
2681   <S {Say}.> What of that?
2682  *<S {Cade}.> Marry, thou ought'st not to let thy horse weare
2683  *a Cloake, when honester men then thou go in their Hose
2684   and Doublets.
2685  *<S {Dicke}.> And worke in their shirt #to, as my selfe for ex-ample,
2686   that am a butcher.
2687   <S {Say}.> You men of Kent.
2688   <S {Dic}.> What say you of Kent.
2689   <S {Say}.> Nothing but this: 'Tis {bona terra, mala gens}.
2690  *<S {Cade}.> Away with him, away with him, he speaks La-tine.
2691  _
2692  *<S {Say}.> Heare me but speake, and beare mee #wher'e you
2693   will:
2694   Kent, in the Commentaries {Caesar} writ,
2695   Is term'd the ciuel'st place of all this Isle:
2696   Sweet is the Country, because full of Riches,
2697   The People Liberall, Valiant, Actiue, Wealthy,
2698   Which makes me hope you are not void of pitty.
2699   I sold not {Maine}, I lost not {Normandie},
2700   Yet to recouer them would loose my life:
2701   Iustice with fauour haue I alwayes done,
2702   Prayres and Teares haue mou'd me, Gifts could neuer.
2703   When haue I ought exacted at your hands?
2704   Kent to maintaine, the King, the Realme and you,
2705   Large gifts haue I bestow'd on learned Clearkes,
2706   Because my Booke preferr'd me to the King.
2707   And seeing Ignorance is the curse of God,
2708   Knowledge the Wing wherewith we flye to heauen.
2709   Vnlesse you be possest with diuellish spirits,
2710   You cannot but forbeare to murther me:
2711   This Tongue hath parlied vnto Forraigne Kings
2712   For your behoofe.
2713  *<S {Cade}.> Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
2714  *<S {Say}.> Great men haue reaching hands: oft haue I struck
2715   Those that I neuer saw, and strucke them dead.
2716  *<S {Geo}.> O monstrous Coward! What, to come behinde
2717   Folkes?
2718  *<S {Say}.> These cheekes are pale for watching for your good
2719  *<S {Cade}.> Giue him a box o'th' eare, and that wil make 'em
2720   red againe.
2721   <S {Say}.> Long sitting to determine poore mens causes,
2722   Hath made me full of sicknesse and diseases.
2723  *<S {Cade}.> Ye shall haue a hempen Candle then, & the help
2724   of hatchet.
2725   <S {Dicke}.> Why dost thou quiuer man?
2726   <S {Say}.> The Palsie, and not feare prouokes me.
2727  *<S {Cade}.> Nay, he noddes at vs, as who should say, Ile be
2728  *euen with you. Ile see if his head will stand steddier on
2729   a pole, or no: Take him away, and behead him.
2730   <S {Say}.> Tell me: wherein haue I offended most?
2731   Haue I affected wealth, or honor? Speake.
2732   Are my Chests fill'd vp with extorted Gold?
2733   Is my Apparrell sumptuous to behold?
2734   Whom haue I iniur'd, that ye seeke my death?
2735   These hands are free from guiltlesse bloodshedding,
2736   This breast from harbouring foule deceitfull thoughts.
2737   O let me liue.
2738  *<S {Cade}.> I feele remorse in my selfe with his words: but
2739  *Ile bridle it: he shall dye, #and it bee but for pleading so
2740  *well for his life. Away with him, he ha's a Familiar vn-der
2741  *his Tongue, he speakes not #a Gods name. Goe, take
2742  *him away I say, and strike off his head presently, and then
2743  *breake into his Sonne in Lawes house, Sir {Iames Cromer},
2744  *and strike off his head, and bring them both vppon two
2745   poles hither.
2746   <S {All}.> It shall be done.
2747  *<S {Say}.> Ah Countrimen: If when you make your prair's,
2748   God should be so obdurate as your selues:
2749   How would it fare with your departed soules,
2750   And therefore yet relent, and saue my life.
2751  *<S {Cade}.> Away with him, and do as I command ye: the
2752  *proudest Peere in the Realme, shall not weare a head on
2753  *his shoulders, vnlesse he pay me tribute: there shall not
2754  *a maid be married, but she shall pay to me her Mayden-head
2755  *ere they haue it: Men shall hold of mee in Capite.
2756  *And we charge and command, that their wiues be as free
2757   as heart can wish, or tongue can tell.
2758   <S {Dicke}.> My Lord,
2759  *When shall we go to Cheapside, and take vp commodi-ties
2760   vpon our billes?
2761   <S {Cade}.> Marry presently.
2762   <S {All}.> O braue.
2763   <D {Enter one with the heads}.>
2764   <S {Cade}.> But is not this brauer:
2765   Let them kisse one another: For they lou'd well
2766   When they were aliue. Now part them againe,
2767   Least they consult about the giuing vp
2768   Of some more Townes in France. Soldiers,
2769   Deferre the spoile of the Citie vntill night:
2770   For with these borne before vs, in steed of Maces,
2771   Will we ride through the streets, & at euery Corner
2772   Haue them kisse. Away.  <D {Exit}>
2773   <D {Alarum, and Retreat. Enter againe Cade},
2774   {and all his rabblement}.>
2775  *<S {Cade}.> Vp Fish- streete, downe Saint Magnes corner,
2776   kill and knocke downe, throw them into Thames:
2777   <D {Sound a parley}.>
2778   What noise is this I heare?
2779   Dare any be so bold to sound Retreat or Parley
2780   When I command them kill?
      <P o1v>
2781   <D {Enter Buckingham, and old Clifford}.>
2782   <S {Buc}.> #I heere they be, that dare and will disturb thee:
2783   Know {Cade}, we come Ambassadors from the King
2784   Vnto the Commons, whom thou hast misled,
2785   And heere pronounce free pardon to them all,
2786   That will forsake thee, and go home in peace.
2787   <S {Clif}.> What say ye Countrimen, will ye relent
2788   And yeeld to mercy, whil'st 'tis offered you,
2789   Or let a rabble leade you to your deaths.
2790   Who loues the King, and will imbrace his pardon,
2791   Fling vp his cap, and say, God saue his Maiesty.
2792   Who hateth him, and honors not his Father,
2793   Henry the fift, that made all France to quake,
2794   Shake he his weapon at vs, and passe by.
2795   <S {All}.> God saue the King, God saue the King.
2796  *<S {Cade}.> What Buckingham and Clifford are ye so braue?
2797  *And you base Pezants, do ye beleeue him, will you needs
2798  *be hang'd with your Pardons about your neckes? Hath
2799  *my sword therefore broke through London gates, that
2800  *you should leaue me at the White- heart in Southwarke.
2801  *I thought ye would neuer haue giuen out these Armes til
2802  *you had recouered your ancient Freedome. But you are
2803  *all Recreants and Dastards, and delight to liue in slauerie
2804  *to the Nobility. Let them breake your backes with bur-thens,
2805  *take your houses ouer your heads, rauish your
2806  *Wiues and Daughters before your faces. For me, I will
2807  *make shift for one, and so Gods Cursse light vppon you
2808   all.
2809   <S {All}.> Wee'l follow {Cade},
2810   Wee'l follow {Cade}.
2811   <S {Clif}.> Is {Cade} the sonne of {Henry} the fift,
2812   That thus you do exclaime you'l go with him.
2813   Will he conduct you through the heart of France,
2814   And make the meanest of you Earles and Dukes?
2815   Alas, he hath no home, no place to flye #too:
2816   Nor knowes he how to liue, but by the spoile,
2817   Vnlesse by robbing of your Friends, and vs.
2818   #Wer't not a shame, that whilst you liue at iarre,
2819   The fearfull French, whom you late vanquished
2820   Should make a start ore- seas, and vanquish you?
2821   Me thinkes alreadie in this ciuill broyle,
2822   I see them Lording it in London streets,
2823   Crying {Villiago} vnto all they meete.
2824   Better ten thousand base- borne {Cades} miscarry,
2825   Then you should stoope vnto a Frenchmans mercy.
2826   To France, to France, and get what you haue lost:
2827   Spare England, for it is your Natiue Coast:
2828   {Henry} hath mony, you are strong and manly:
2829   God on our side, doubt not of Victorie.
2830   <S {All}.> A Clifford, a Clifford,
2831   Wee'l follow the King, and Clifford.
2832  *<S {Cade}.> Was euer Feather so lightly blowne #too & fro,
2833  *as this multitude? The name of Henry the fift, hales them
2834  *to an hundred mischiefes, and makes them leaue mee de-solate.
2835  *I see them lay their heades together to surprize
2836  *me. My sword make way for me, for heere is no staying:
2837  *in despight of the diuels and #hell, haue through the verie
2838  *middest of you, and heauens and honor be witnesse, that
2839  *no want of resolution in mee, but onely my Followers
2840  *base and ignominious treasons, makes me betake mee to
2841   my heeles.  <D {Exit}>
2842   <S {Buck}.> What, is he fled? Go some and follow him,
2843   And he that brings his head vnto the King,
2844   Shall haue a thousand Crownes for his reward.
2845   <D {Exeunt some of them}.>
2846   Follow me souldiers, wee'l deuise a meane,
2847   To reconcile you all vnto the King.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
2848   <D {Sound Trumpets. Enter King, Queene, and}
2849   {#Somerset on the Tarras}.>
2850   <S {King}.> Was euer King that ioy'd an earthly Throne,
2851   And could command no more content then I?
2852   No sooner was I crept out of my Cradle,
2853   But I was made a King, at nine months olde.
2854   Was neuer Subiect long'd to be a King,
2855   As I do long and wish to be a Subiect.
2856   <D {Enter Buckingham and Clifford}.>
2857   <S {Buc}.> Health and glad tydings to your Maiesty.
2858  *<S {Kin}.> Why Buckingham, is the Traitor {Cade} surpris'd?
2859   Or is he but retir'd to make him strong?
2860   <D {Enter Multitudes with Halters about their}
2861   {Neckes}.>
2862  *<S {Clif}.> He is fled my Lord, and all his powers do yeeld,
2863   And humbly thus with halters on their neckes,
2864   Expect your Highnesse doome of life, or death.
2865   <S {King}.> Then heauen set ope thy euerlasting gates,
2866   To entertaine my vowes of thankes and praise.
2867   Souldiers, this day haue you redeem'd your liues,
2868  *And shew'd how well you loue your Prince & Countrey:
2869   Continue still in this so good a minde,
2870   And {Henry} though he be infortunate,
2871   Assure your selues will neuer be vnkinde:
2872   And so with thankes, and pardon to you all,
2873   I do dismisse you to your seuerall Countries.
2874   <S {All}.> God saue the King, God saue the King.
2875   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2876   <S {Mes}.> Please it your Grace to be aduertised,
2877   The Duke of Yorke is newly come from Ireland,
2878   And with a puissant and a mighty power
2879   Of Gallow- glasses and stout Kernes,
2880   Is marching hitherward in proud array,
2881   And still proclaimeth as he comes along,
2882   His Armes are onely to remoue from thee
2883   The Duke of Somerset, whom he tearmes a Traitor.
2884  *<S {King}.> Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and Yorke
2885   distrest,
2886   Like to a Ship, that hauing scap'd a Tempest,
2887   Is straight way calme, and boorded with a Pyrate.
2888   But now is Cade driuen backe, his men dispierc'd,
2889   And now is Yorke in Armes, to second him.
2890   I pray thee Buckingham go and meete him,
2891   And aske him what's the reason of these Armes:
2892   Tell him, Ile send Duke {Edmund} to the Tower,
2893   And {Somerset} we will commit thee thither,
2894   Vntill his Army be dismist from him.
2895   <S {Somerset}.> My Lord,
2896   Ile yeelde my selfe to prison willingly,
2897   Or vnto death, to do my Countrey good.
2898   <S {King}.> In any case, be not #to rough in termes,
2899   For he is fierce, and cannot brooke hard Language.
2900   <S {Buc}.> I will my Lord, and doubt not so to deale,
2901   As all things shall redound vnto your good.
2902  *<S {King}.> Come wife, let's in, and learne to gouern better,
2903   For yet may England curse my wretched raigne.
2904   <D {Flourish. Exeunt}.>
      <P o2>
2905   <D {Enter Cade}.>
2906  *<S {Cade}.> Fye on Ambitions: fie on my selfe, that haue a
2907  *sword, and yet am ready to famish. These fiue daies haue
2908  *I hid me in these Woods, and durst not peepe out, for all
2909  *the Country is laid for me: but now am I so hungry, that
2910  *if I might haue a Lease of my life for a thousand yeares, I
2911  *could stay no longer. Wherefore on a Bricke wall haue
2912  *I climb'd into this Garden, to see if I can eate Grasse, or
2913  *picke a Sallet another while, which is not amisse to coole
2914  *a mans stomacke this hot weather: and I think this word
2915  *Sallet was borne to do me good: for many a time but for
2916  *a Sallet, my brain- pan had bene cleft with a brown Bill;
2917  *and many a time when I haue beene dry, & brauely mar-ching,
2918  *it hath seru'd me insteede of a quart pot to drinke
2919   in: and now the word Sallet must serue me to feed on.
2920   <D {Enter Iden}.>
2921  *<S {Iden}.> Lord, who would liue turmoyled in the Court,
2922   And may enioy such quiet walkes as these?
2923   This small inheritance my Father left me,
2924   Contenteth me, and worth a Monarchy.
2925   I seeke not to waxe great by others warning,
2926   Or gather wealth I care not with what enuy:
2927   Sufficeth, that I haue maintaines my state,
2928   And sends the poore well pleased from my gate.
2929  *<S {Cade}.> Heere's the Lord of the soile come to seize me
2930  *for a stray, for entering his Fee- simple without leaue. #A
2931  *Villaine, thou wilt betray me, and get a 1000. Crownes
2932  *of the King by carrying my head to him, but Ile make
2933  *thee eate Iron like an Ostridge, and swallow my Sword
2934   like a great pin ere thou and I part.
2935   <S {Iden}.> Why rude Companion, whatsoere thou be,
2936   I know thee not, why then should I betray thee?
2937   Is't not enough to breake into my Garden,
2938   And like a Theefe to come to rob my grounds:
2939   Climbing my walles inspight of me the Owner,
2940   But thou wilt braue me with these sawcie termes?
2941  *<S {Cade}.> Braue thee? #I by the best blood that euer was
2942  *broach'd, and beard thee #to. Looke on mee well, I haue
2943  *eate no meate these fiue dayes, yet come thou and thy
2944  *fiue men, #and if I doe not leaue you all as dead as a doore
2945   naile, I pray God I may neuer eate grasse more.
2946  *<S {Iden}.> Nay, it shall nere be said, while England stands,
2947   That {Alexander Iden} an Esquire of Kent,
2948   Tooke oddes to combate a poore famisht man.
2949   Oppose thy stedfast gazing eyes to mine,
2950   See if thou canst out- face me with thy lookes:
2951   Set limbe to limbe, and thou art farre the lesser:
2952   Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
2953   Thy legge a sticke compared with this Truncheon,
2954   My foote shall fight with all the strength thou hast,
2955   And if mine arme be heaued in the Ayre,
2956   Thy graue is digg'd already in the earth:
2957   As for words, whose greatnesse answer's words,
2958   Let this my sword report what speech forbeares.
2959  *<S {Cade}.> By my Valour: the most compleate Champi-on
2960  *that euer I heard. Steele, if thou turne the edge, or
2961  *cut not out the burly bon'd Clowne in chines of Beefe,
2962  *ere thou sleepe in thy Sheath, I beseech Ioue on my knees
2963   thou mayst be turn'd to Hobnailes.
2964   <D {Heere they Fight}.>
2965  *O I am slaine, Famine and no other hath slaine me, let ten
2966  *thousand diuelles come against me, and giue me but the
2967  *ten meales I haue lost, and I'de defie them all. Wither
2968  *Garden, and be henceforth a burying place to all that do
2969  *dwell in this house, because the vnconquered soule of
2970   {Cade} is fled.
2971  *<S {Iden}.> Is't {Cade} that I haue slain, that monstrous traitor?
2972   Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deede,
2973   And hang thee o're my Tombe, when I am dead.
2974   Ne're shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
2975   But thou shalt weare it as a Heralds coate,
2976   To emblaze the Honor that thy Master got.
2977  *<S {Cade}.> {Iden} farewell, and be proud of thy victory: Tell
2978  *Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all
2979  *the World to be Cowards: For I that neuer feared any,
2980   am vanquished by Famine, not by Valour.  <D {Dyes}.>
2981  *<S {Id}.> How much thou wrong'st me, heauen be my iudge;
2982   Die damned Wretch, the curse of her that bare thee:
2983   And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
2984   So wish I, I might thrust thy soule to #hell.
2985   Hence will I dragge thee headlong by the heeles
2986   Vnto a dunghill, which shall be thy graue,
2987   And there cut off thy most vngracious head,
2988   Which I will beare in triumph to the King,
2989   Leauing thy trunke for Crowes to feed vpon.  <D {Exit}.>
2990   <D {Enter Yorke, and his Army of Irish, with}
2991   {Drum and Colours}.>
2992  *<S {Yor}.> From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
2993   And plucke the Crowne from feeble {Henries} head.
2994   Ring Belles alowd, burne Bonfires cleare and bright
2995   To entertaine great Englands lawfull King.
2996   Ah {Sancta Maiestas}! who would not buy thee deere?
2997   Let them obey, that knowes not how to Rule.
2998   This hand was made to handle nought but Gold.
2999   I cannot giue due action to my words,
3000   Except a Sword or Scepter ballance it.
3001   A Scepter shall it haue, haue I a soule,
3002   On which Ile tosse the Fleure- de- Luce of France.
3003   <D {Enter Buckingham}.>
3004   Whom haue we heere? Buckingham to disturbe me?
3005   The king hath sent him sure: I must dissemble.
3006   <S {Buc}.> Yorke, if thou meanest wel, I greet thee well.
3007  *<S {Yor}.> {Humfrey} of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
3008   Art thou a Messenger, or come of pleasure.
3009   <S {Buc}.> A Messenger from {Henry}, our dread Liege,
3010   To know the reason of these Armes in peace.
3011   Or why, thou being a Subiect, as I am,
3012   Against thy Oath, and true Allegeance sworne,
3013   Should raise so great a power without his leaue?
3014   Or dare to bring thy Force so neere the Court?
3015   <S {Yor}.> Scarse can I speake, my Choller is so great.
3016   Oh I could hew vp Rockes, and fight with Flint,
3017   I am so angry at these abiect tearmes.
3018   And now like {Aiax Telamonius},
3019   On Sheepe or Oxen could I spend my furie.
3020   I am farre better borne then is the king:
3021   More like a King, more Kingly in my thoughts.
3022   But I must make faire weather yet #a while,
3023   Till {Henry} be more weake, and I more strong.
3024   Buckingham, I prethee pardon me,
3025   That I haue giuen no answer all this while:
3026   My minde was troubled with deepe Melancholly.
3027   The cause why I haue brought this Armie hither,
      <P o2v>
3028   Is to remoue proud Somerset from the King,
3029   Seditious to his Grace, and to the State.
3030   <S {Buc}.> That is too much presumption on thy part:
3031   But if thy Armes be to no other end,
3032   The King hath yeelded vnto thy demand:
3033   The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
3034   <S {Yorke}.> Vpon thine Honor is he Prisoner?
3035   <S {Buck}.> Vpon mine Honor he is Prisoner.
3036   <S {Yorke}.> Then Buckingham I do dismisse my Powres.
3037   Souldiers, I thanke you all: disperse your selues:
3038   Meet me to morrow in S[aint]. Georges Field,
3039   You shall haue pay, and euery thing you wish.
3040   And let my Soueraigne, vertuous {Henry},
3041   Command my eldest sonne, nay all my sonnes,
3042   As pledges of my Fealtie and Loue,
3043   Ile send them all as willing as I liue:
3044   Lands, Goods, Horse, Armor, any thing I haue
3045   Is his to vse, so Somerset may die.
3046   <S {Buc}.> Yorke, I commend this kinde submission,
3047   We twaine will go into his Highnesse Tent.
3048   <D {Enter King and Attendants}.>
3049  *<S {King}.> Buckingham, doth Yorke intend no harme to vs
3050   That thus he marcheth with thee arme in arme?
3051   <S {Yorke}.> In all submission and humility,
3052   Yorke doth present himselfe vnto your Highnesse.
3053  *<S {K}.> Then what intends these Forces thou dost bring?
3054   <S {Yor}.> To heaue the Traitor Somerset from hence,
3055   And fight against that monstrous Rebell {Cade},
3056   Who since I heard to be discomfited.
3057   <D {Enter Iden with Cades head}.>
3058   <S {Iden}.> If one so rude, and of so meane condition
3059   May passe into the presence of a King:
3060   Loe, I present your Grace a Traitors head,
3061   The head of {Cade}, whom I in combat slew.
3062  *<S {King}.> The head of {Cade}? Great God, how iust art thou?
3063   Oh let me view his Visage being dead,
3064   That liuing wrought me such exceeding trouble.
3065   Tell me my Friend, art thou the man that slew him?
3066   <S {Iden}.> I was, an't like your Maiesty.
3067   <S {King}.> How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree?
3068   <S {Iden}.> {Alexander Iden}, that's my name,
3069   A poore Esquire of Kent, that loues his King.
3070   <S {Buc}.> So please it you my Lord, 'twere not amisse
3071   He were created Knight for his good seruice.
3072   <S {King}.> {Iden}, kneele downe, rise vp a Knight:
3073   We giue thee for reward a thousand Markes,
3074   And will, that thou henceforth attend on vs.
3075   <S {Iden}.> May {Iden} liue to merit such a bountie,
3076   And neuer liue but true vnto his Liege.
3077   <D {Enter Queene and Somerset}.>
3078  *<S {K}.> See Buckingham, Somerset comes with th' Queene,
3079   Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.
3080   <S {Qu}.> For thousand Yorkes he shall not hide his head,
3081   But boldly stand, and front him to his face.
3082   <S {Yor}.> How now? is Somerset at libertie?
3083   Then Yorke vnloose thy long imprisoned thoughts,
3084   And let thy tongue be equall with thy heart.
3085   Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
3086   False King, why hast thou broken faith with me,
3087   Knowing how hardly I can brooke abuse?
3088   King did I call thee? No: thou art not King:
3089   Not fit to gouerne and rule multitudes,
3090   Which dar'st not, no nor canst not rule a Traitor.
3091   That Head of thine doth not become a Crowne:
3092   Thy Hand is made to graspe a Palmers staffe,
3093   And not to grace an awefull Princely Scepter.
3094   That Gold, must round engirt these browes of mine,
3095   Whose Smile and Frowne, like to {Achilles} Speare
3096   Is able with the change, to kill and cure.
3097   Heere is  hand to hold a Scepter vp,
3098   And with the same to acte controlling Lawes:
3099   Giue place: by heauen thou shalt rule no more
3100   O're him, whom heauen created for thy Ruler.
3101   <S {Som}.> O monstrous Traitor! I arrest thee Yorke
3102   Of Capitall Treason 'gainst the King and Crowne:
3103   Obey audacious Traitor, kneele for Grace.
3104  *<S {York}.> Wold'st haue me kneele? First let me ask of thee,
3105   If they can brooke I bow a knee to man:
3106   Sirrah, call in my sonne to be my bale:
3107   I know ere they will haue me go to Ward,
3108   They'l pawne their swords of my infranchisement.
3109   <S {Qu}.> Call hither {Clifford}, bid him come amaine,
3110   To say, if that the Bastard boyes of Yorke
3111   Shall be the Surety for their Traitor Father.
3112   <S {Yorke}.> O blood- bespotted Neopolitan,
3113   Out- cast of {Naples}, Englands bloody Scourge,
3114   The sonnes of Yorke, thy betters in their birth,
3115   Shall be their Fathers baile, and bane to those
3116   That for my Surety will refuse the Boyes.
3117   <D {Enter Edward and Richard}.>
3118   See where they come, Ile warrant they'l make it good.
3119   <D {Enter Clifford}.>
3120   <S {Qu}.> And here comes {Clifford} to deny their baile.
3121  *<S {Clif}.> Health, and all happinesse to my Lord the King.
3122  *<S {Yor}.> I thanke thee {Clifford}: Say, what newes with thee?
3123   Nay, do not fright vs with an angry looke:
3124   We are thy Soueraigne {Clifford}, kneele againe;
3125   For thy mistaking so, We pardon thee.
3126   <S {Clif}.> This is my King Yorke, I do not mistake,
3127   But thou mistakes me much to thinke I do,
3128   To Bedlem with him, is the man growne mad.
3129   <S {King}.> #I Clifford, a Bedlem and ambitious humor
3130   Makes him oppose himselfe against his King.
3131   <S {Clif}.> He is a Traitor, let him to the Tower,
3132   And chop away that factious pate of his.
3133   <S {Qu}.> He is arrested, but will not obey:
3134   His sonnes (he sayes) shall giue their words for him.
3135   <S {Yor}.> Will you not Sonnes?
3136   <S {Edw}.> #I Noble Father, if our words will serue.
3137  *<S {Rich}.> And if words will not, then our Weapons shal.
3138   <S {Clif}.> Why what a brood of Traitors haue we heere?
3139   <S {Yorke}.> Looke in a Glasse, and call thy Image so.
3140   I am thy King, and thou a false- heart Traitor:
3141   Call hither to the stake my two braue Beares,
3142   That with the very shaking of their Chaines,
3143   They may astonish these fell- lurking Curres,
3144   Bid Salsbury and Warwicke come to me.
3145   <D {Enter the Earles of Warwicke, and}
3146   {Salisbury}.>
3147  *<S {Clif}.> Are these thy Beares? Wee'l bate thy Bears to death,
3148   And manacle the Berard in their Chaines,
3149   If thou dar'st bring them to the bayting place.
3150   <S {Rich}.> Oft haue I seene a hot ore- weening Curre,
3151   Run backe and bite, because he was with- held,
3152   Who being suffer'd with the Beares fell paw,
3153   Hath clapt his taile, betweene his legges and cride,
3154   And such a peece of seruice will you do,
      <P o3>
3155   If you oppose your selues to match Lord Warwicke.
3156   <S {Clif}.> Hence heape of wrath, foule indigested lumpe,
3157   As crooked in thy manners, as thy shape.
3158   <S {Yor}.> Nay we shall heate you thorowly anon.
3159   <S {Clif}.> Take heede least by your heate you burne your
3160   selues:
3161  *<S {King}.> Why Warwicke, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
3162   Old Salsbury, shame to thy siluer haire,
3163   Thou mad misleader of thy brain- sicke sonne,
3164   What wilt thou on thy death- bed play the Ruffian?
3165   And seeke for sorrow with thy Spectacles?
3166   Oh where is Faith? Oh, where is Loyalty?
3167   If it be banisht from the frostie head,
3168   Where shall it finde a harbour in the earth?
3169   Wilt thou go digge a graue to finde out Warre,
3170   And shame thine honourable Age with blood?
3171   Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
3172   Or wherefore doest abuse it, if thou hast it?
3173   For shame in dutie bend thy knee to me,
3174   That bowes vnto the graue with mickle age.
3175   <S {Sal}.> My Lord, I haue considered with my selfe
3176   The Title of this most renowned Duke,
3177   And in my conscience, do repute his grace
3178   The rightfull heyre to Englands Royall seate.
3179   <S {King}.> Hast thou not sworne Allegeance vnto me?
3180   <S {Sal}.> I haue.
3181  *<S {Ki}.> Canst thou dispense with heauen for such an oath?
3182   <S {Sal}.> It is great sinne, to sweare vnto a sinne:
3183   But greater sinne to keepe a sinfull oath:
3184   Who can be bound by any solemne Vow
3185   To do a murd'rous deede, to rob a man,
3186   To force a spotlesse Virgins Chastitie,
3187   To reaue the Orphan of his Patrimonie,
3188   To wring the Widdow from her custom'd right,
3189   And haue no other reason for this wrong,
3190   But that he was bound by a solemne Oath?
3191   <S {Qu}.> A subtle Traitor needs no Sophister.
3192   <S {King}.> Call Buckingham, and bid him arme himselfe.
3193  *<S {Yorke}.> Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
3194   I am resolu'd for death and dignitie.
3195  *<S {Old} {Clif}.> The first I warrant thee, if dreames proue true
3196  *<S {War}.> You were best to go to bed, and dreame againe,
3197   To keepe thee from the Tempest of the field.
3198   <S {Old} {Clif}.> I am resolu'd to beare a greater storme,
3199   Then any thou canst coniure vp to day:
3200   And that Ile write vpon thy Burgonet,
3201   Might I but know thee by thy housed Badge.
3202   <S {War}.> Now by my Fathers badge, old {Neuils} Crest,
3203   The rampant Beare chain'd to the ragged staffe,
3204   This day Ile weare aloft my Burgonet,
3205   As on a Mountaine top, the Cedar shewes,
3206   That keepes his leaues inspight of any storme,
3207   Euen to affright thee with the view thereof.
3208  *<S {Old} {Clif}.> And from thy Burgonet Ile rend thy Beare,
3209   And tread it vnder foot with all contempt,
3210   Despight the Bearard, that protects the Beare.
3211   <S {Yo.Clif}.> And so to Armes victorious Father,
3212   To quell the Rebels, and their Complices.
3213   <S {Rich}.> Fie, Charitie for shame, speake not in spight,
3214   For you shall sup with Iesu Christ to night.
3215   <S {Yo.Clif}.> Foule stygmaticke that's more then thou
3216   canst tell.
3217   <S {Ric}.> If not in heauen, you'l surely sup in #hell.  <D {Exeunt}>
3218   <D {Enter Warwicke}.>
3219  *<S {War}.> Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwicke calles:
3220   #And if thou dost not hide thee from the Beare,
3221   Now when the angrie Trumpet sounds alarum,
3222   And dead mens cries do fill the emptie ayre,
3223   Clifford I say, come forth and fight with me,
3224   Proud Northerne Lord, Clifford of Cumberland,
3225   Warwicke is hoarse with calling thee to armes.
3226   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
3227   <S {War}.> How now my Noble Lord? What all a- foot.
3228   <S {Yor}.> The deadly handed Clifford slew my Steed:
3229   But match to match I haue encountred him,
3230   And made a prey for Carrion Kytes and Crowes
3231   Euen of the bonnie beast he loued so well.
3232   <D {Enter Clifford}.>
3233   <S {War}.> Of one or both of vs the time is come.
3234  *<S {Yor}.> Hold Warwick: seek thee out some other chace
3235   For I my selfe must hunt this Deere to death.
3236  *<S {War}.> Then nobly Yorke, 'tis for a Crown thou fightst:
3237   As I intend Clifford to thriue to day,
3238   It greeues my soule to leaue thee vnassail'd.  <D {Exit War}.>
3239   <S {Clif}.> What seest thou in me Yorke?
3240   Why dost thou pause?
3241   <S {Yorke}.> With thy braue bearing should I be in loue,
3242   But that thou art so fast mine enemie.
3243  *<S {Clif}.> Nor should thy prowesse want praise & esteeme,
3244   But that 'tis shewne ignobly, and in Treason.
3245   <S {Yorke}.> So let it helpe me now against thy sword,
3246   As I in iustice, and true right expresse it.
3247   <S {Clif}.> My soule and bodie on the action both.
3248   <S {Yor}.> A dreadfull lay, addresse thee instantly.
3249   <S {Clif}.> {La fin Corrone les eumenes}.
3250  *<S {Yor}.> Thus Warre hath giuen thee peace, for y art still,
3251   Peace with his soule, heauen if it be thy #will.
3252   <D {Enter yong Clifford}.>
3253   <S {Clif}.> Shame and Confusion all is on the rout,
3254   Feare frames disorder, and disorder wounds
3255   Where it should guard. O Warre, thou sonne of #hell,
3256   Whom angry heauens do make their minister,
3257   Throw in the frozen bosomes of our part,
3258   Hot Coales of Vengeance. Let no Souldier flye.
3259   He that is truly dedicate to Warre,
3260   Hath no selfe- loue: nor he that loues himselfe,
3261   Hath not essentially, but by circumstance
3262   The name of Valour. O let the vile world end,
3263   And the premised Flames of the Last day,
3264   Knit earth and heauen together.
3265   Now let the generall Trumpet blow his blast,
3266   Particularities, and pettie sounds
3267   To cease. Was't thou ordain'd (deere Father)
3268   To loose thy youth in peace, and to atcheeue
3269   The Siluer Liuery of aduised Age,
3270   And in thy Reuerence, and thy Chaire- dayes, thus
3271   To die in Ruffian battell? Euen at this sight,
3272   My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,
3273   It shall be stony. Yorke, not our old men spares:
3274   No more will I their Babes, Teares Virginall,
3275   Shall be to me, euen as the Dew to Fire,
3276   And Beautie, that the Tyrant oft reclaimes,
3277   Shall to my flaming wrath, be Oyle and Flax:
3278   Henceforth, I will not haue to do with pitty.
3279   Meet I an infant of the house of Yorke,
3280   Into as many gobbits will I cut it
3281   As wilde {Medea} yong {Absirtis} did.
3282   In cruelty, will I seeke out my Fame.
3283   Come thou new ruine of olde Cliffords house:
3284   As did {Aeneas} old {Anchyses} beare,
3285   So beare I thee vpon my manly shoulders:
3286   But then, {Aeneas} bare a liuing loade;
      <P o3v>
3287   Nothing so heauy as these woes of mine.
3288   <D {Enter Richard, and Somerset to fight}.>
3289   <S {Rich}.> So lye thou there:
3290   For vnderneath an Ale- house paltry signe,
3291   The Castle in S[aint]. {Albons}, Somerset
3292   Hath made the Wizard famous in his death:
3293   Sword, hold thy temper; Heart, be wrathfull still:
3294   Priests pray for enemies, but Princes kill.
3295   <D {Fight. Excursions}.>
3296   <D {Enter King, Queene, and others}.>
3297  *<S {Qu}.> Away my Lord, you are slow, for shame away.
3298  *<S {King}.> Can we outrun the Heauens? Good {Margaret}
3299   stay.
3300  *<S {Qu}.> What are you made of? You'l nor fight nor fly:
3301   Now is it manhood, wisedome, and defence,
3302   To giue the enemy way, and to secure vs
3303   By what we can, which can no more but flye.
3304   <D {Alarum #a farre off}.>
3305   If you be tane, we then should see the bottome
3306   Of all our Fortunes: but if we haply scape,
3307   (As well we may, if not through your neglect)
3308   We shall to London get, where you are lou'd,
3309   And where this breach now in our Fortunes made
3310   May readily be stopt.
3311   <D {Enter Clifford}.>
3312   <S {Clif}.> But that my hearts on future mischeefe set,
3313   I would speake blasphemy ere bid you flye:
3314   But flye you must: Vncureable discomfite
3315   Reignes in the hearts of all our present parts.
3316   Away for your releefe, and we will liue
3317   To see their day, and them our Fortune giue.
3318   Away my Lord, away.  <D {Exeunt}>
3319   <D {Alarum. Retreat. Enter Yorke, Richard, Warwicke},
3320   {and Soldiers, with Drum & Colours}.>
3321   <S {Yorke}.> Of Salsbury, who can report of him,
3322   That Winter Lyon, who in rage forgets
3323   Aged contusions, and all brush of Time:
3324   And like a Gallant, in the brow of youth,
3325   Repaires him with Occasion. This happy day
3326   Is not it selfe, nor haue we wonne one foot,
3327   If Salsbury be lost.
3328   <S {Rich}.> My Noble Father:
3329   Three times to day I holpe him to his horse,
3330   Three times bestrid him: Thrice I led him off,
3331   Perswaded him from any further act:
3332   But still where danger was, still there I met him,
3333   And like rich hangings in a homely house,
3334   So was his #Will, in his old feeble body,
3335   But Noble as he is, looke where he comes.
3336   <D {Enter Salisbury}.>
3337  *<S {Sal}.> Now by my Sword, well hast thou fought to day:
3338   By'th' Masse so did we all. I thanke you {Richard}.
3339   God knowes how long it is I haue to liue:
3340   And it hath pleas'd him that three times to day
3341   You haue defended me from imminent death.
3342   Well Lords, we haue not got that which we haue,
3343   'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
3344   Being opposites of such repayring Nature.
3345   <S {Yorke}.> I know our safety is to follow them,
3346   For (as I heare) the King is fled to London,
3347   To call a present Court of Parliament:
3348   Let vs pursue him ere the Writs go forth.
3349   What sayes Lord Warwicke, shall we after them?
3350   <S {War}.> After them: nay before them if we can:
3351   Now by my hand (Lords) 'twas a glorious day.
3352   Saint Albons battell wonne by famous Yorke,
3353   Shall be eterniz'd in all Age to come.
3354   Sound Drumme and Trumpets, and to London all,
3355   And more such dayes as these, to vs befall.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3356   <Z FINIS.
3357   The second Part of Henry the Sixt,
3358   with the death of the Good Duke
3359   HVMFREY.>
