2     *<D {Enter the Duke of Ephesus, with the Merchant of Siracusa},
3      {Iaylor, and other attendants}.>
4      <S {Marchant}.>
5      Proceed {Solinus} to procure my fall,
6     *And by the doome of death end woes and all.
7     *<S {Duke}.> Merchant of {Siracusa}, plead no more.
8      I am not partiall to infringe our Lawes;
9      The enmity and discord which of late
10     Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke,
11     To Merchants our well- dealing Countrimen,
12     Who wanting gilders to redeeme their liues,
13     Haue seal'd his rigorous statutes with their blouds,
14     Excludes all pitty from our threatning lookes:
15     For since the mortall and intestine iarres
16     Twixt thy seditious Countrimen and vs,
17     It hath in solemne Synodes beene decreed,
18     Both by the {Siracusians} and our selues,
19     To admit no trafficke to our aduerse townes:
20     Nay more, if any borne at {Ephesus}
21     Be seene at any {Siracusian} Marts and Fayres:
22     Againe, if any {Siracusian} borne
23     Come to the Bay of {Ephesus}, he dies:
24     His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose,
25     Vnlesse a thousand markes be leuied
26     To quit the penalty, and to ransome him:
27     Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
28     Cannot amount vnto a hundred Markes,
29     Therefore by Law thou art condemn'd to die.
30    *<S {Mer}.> Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,
31     My woes end likewise with the euening Sonne.
32     <S {Duk}.> Well {Siracusian}; say in briefe the cause
33     Why thou departedst from thy natiue home?
34     And for what cause thou cam'st to {Ephesus}.
35    *<S {Mer}.> A heauier taske could not haue beene impos'd,
36     Then I to speake my griefes vnspeakeable:
37     Yet that the world may witnesse that my end
38     Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
39     Ile vtter what my sorrow giues me leaue.
40     In {Syracusa} was I borne, and wedde
41     Vnto a woman, happy but for me,
42     And by me; had not our hap beene bad:
43     With her I liu'd in ioy, our wealth increast
44     By prosperous voyages I often made
45     To {Epidamium}, till my factors death,
46     And he great care of goods at randone left,
47     Drew me from kinde embracements of my spouse;
48     From whom my absence was not sixe moneths olde,
49     Before her selfe (almost at fainting vnder
50     The pleasing punishment that women beare)
51     Had made prouision for her following me,
52     And soone, and safe, arriued where I was:
53     There had she not beene long, but she became
54     A ioyfull mother of two goodly sonnes:
55     And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
56     As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
57     That very howre, and in the selfe- same Inne,
58     A meane woman was deliuered
59     Of such a burthen Male, twins both alike:
60     Those, for their parents were exceeding poore,
61     I bought, and brought vp to attend my sonnes.
62     My wife, not meanely prowd of two such boyes,
63     Made daily motions for our home returne:
64     Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too soone wee came aboord.
65     A league from {Epidamium} had we saild
66     Before the alwaies winde- obeying deepe
67     Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme:
68     But longer did we not retaine much hope;
69     For what obscured light the heauens did grant,
70     Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes
71     A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,
72     Which though my selfe would gladly haue imbrac'd,
73     Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
74     Weeping before for what she saw must come,
75     And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes
76     That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to feare,
77     Forst me to seeke delayes for them and me,
78     And this it was: (for other meanes was none)
79     The Sailors sought for safety by our boate,
80     And left the ship then sinking ripe to vs.
81     My wife, more carefull for the latter borne,
82     Had fastned him vnto a small spare Mast,
83     Such as sea- faring men prouide for stormes:
84     To him one of the other twins was bound,
85     Whil'st I had beene like heedfull of the other.
86     The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
87     Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,
88     Fastned our selues at eyther end the mast,
89     And floating straight, obedient to the streame,
90     Was carried towards {Corinth}, as we thought.
91     At length the sonne gazing vpon the earth,
92     Disperst those vapours that offended vs,
93     And by the benefit of his wished light
94     The seas waxt calme, and we discouered
95     Two shippes from farre, making amaine to vs:
96     Of {Corinth} that, of {Epidarus} this,
97     But ere they came, oh let me say no more,
98     Gather the sequell by that went before.
99     <S {Duk}.> Nay forward old man, doe not breake off so,
      <P H1v>
100    For we may pitty, though not pardon thee.
101    <S {Merch}.> Oh had the gods done so, I had not now
102    Worthily tearm'd them mercilesse to vs:
103    For ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues,
104    We were encountred by a mighty rocke,
105    Which being violently borne vp,
106    Our helpefull ship was splitted in the midst;
107    So that in this vniust diuorce of vs,
108    Fortune had left to both of vs alike,
109    What to delight in, what to sorrow for,
110    Her part, poore soule, seeming as burdened
111    With lesser waight, but not with lesser woe,
112    Was carried with more speed before the winde,
113    And in our sight they three were taken vp
114    By Fishermen of {Corinth}, as we thought.
115    At length another ship had seiz'd on vs,
116    And knowing whom it was their hap to saue,
117    Gaue healthfull welcome to their ship- wrackt guests,
118    And would haue reft the Fishers of their prey,
119    Had not their backe beene very slow of saile;
120    And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
121    Thus haue you heard me seuer'd from my blisse,
122    That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
123    To tell sad stories of my owne mishaps.
124    <S {Duke}.> And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
125    Doe me the fauour to dilate at full,
126    What haue befalne of them and they till now.
127    <S {Merch}.> My yongest boy, and yet my eldest care,
128    At eighteene yeeres became inquisitiue
129    After his brother; and importun'd me
130    That his attendant, so his case was like,
131    Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name,
132    Might beare him company in the quest of him:
133    Whom whil'st I laboured of a loue to see,
134    I hazarded the losse of whom I lou'd.
135    Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest {Greece},
136    Roming cleane through the bounds of {Asia},
137    And coasting homeward, came to {Ephesus}:
138    Hopelesse to finde, yet loth to leaue vnsought
139    Or that, or any place that harbours men:
140    But heere must end the story of my life,
141    And happy were I in my timelie death,
142    Could all my trauells warrant me they liue.
143    <S {Duke}.> Haplesse {Egeon} whom the fates haue markt
144    To beare the extremitie of dire mishap:
145    Now trust me, were it not against our Lawes,
146    Against my Crowne, my oath, my dignity,
147    Which Princes would they may not disanull,
148    My soule should sue as aduocate for thee:
149    But though  thou art adiudged to the death,
150    And passed sentence may not be recal'd
151    But to our honours great disparagement:
152    Yet will I fauour thee in what I can;
153    Therefore Marchant, Ile limit thee this day
154    To seeke thy helpe by beneficiall helpe,
155    Try all the friends thou hast in {Ephesus},
156    Beg thou, or borrow, to make vp the summe,
157    And liue: if no, then thou art doom'd to die:
158    Iaylor, take him to thy custodie.
159    <S {Iaylor}.> I will my Lord.
160    <S {Merch}.> Hopelesse and helpelesse doth {Egean} wend,
161    But to procrastinate his liuelesse end.  <D {Exeunt}.>
162    <D {Enter Antipholis Erotes, a Marchant, and Dromio}.>
163    <S {Mer}.> Therefore giue out you are of {Epidamium},
164    Lest that your goods too soone be confiscate:
      <C D>
165    This very day a {Syracusian} Marchant
166    Is apprehended for a riuall here,
167    And not being able to buy out his life,
168    According to the statute of the towne,
169    Dies ere the wearie sunne set in the West:
170    There is your monie that I had to keepe.
171    <S {Ant}.> Goe beare it to the Centaure, where we host,
172    And stay there {Dromio}, till I come to thee;
173    Within this houre it will be dinner time,
174    Till that Ile view the manners of the towne,
175    Peruse the traders, gaze vpon the buildings,
176    And then returne and sleepe within mine Inne,
177    For with long trauaile I am stiffe and wearie.
178    Get thee away.
179    <S {Dro}.> Many a man would take you at your word,
180    And goe indeede, hauing so good a meane.
181    <D {Exit Dromio}.>
182    <S {Ant}.> A trustie villaine sir, that very oft,
183    When I am dull with care and melancholly,
184    Lightens my humour with his merry iests:
185    What will you walke with me about the towne,
186    And then goe to my Inne and dine with me?
187    <S {E.Mar}.> I am inuited sir to certaine Marchants,
188    Of whom I hope to make much benefit:
189    I craue your pardon, soone at fiue #a clocke,
190    Please you, Ile meete with you vpon the Mart,
191    And afterward consort you till bed time:
192    My present businesse cals me from you now.
193    <S {Ant}.> Farewell till then: I will goe loose my selfe,
194    And wander vp and downe to view the Citie.
195   *<S {E.Mar}.> Sir, I commend you to your owne content.
196    <D {Exeunt}.>
197    <S {Ant}.> He that commends me to mine owne content,
198    Commends me to the thing I cannot get:
199    I to the world am like a drop of water,
200    That in the Ocean seekes another drop,
201    Who falling there to finde his fellow forth,
202    (Vnseene, inquisitiue) confounds himselfe.
203    So I, to finde a Mother and a Brother,
204    In quest of them (vnhappie #a) loose my selfe.
205    <D {Enter Dromio of Ephesus}.>
206    Here comes the almanacke of my true date:
207    What now? How chance thou art return'd so soone.
208   *<S {E.Dro}.> Return'd so soone, rather approacht too late:
209    The Capon burnes, the Pig fals from the spit;
210    The clocke hath strucken twelue vpon the bell:
211    My Mistris made it one vpon my cheeke:
212    She is so hot because the meate is colde:
213    The meate is colde, because you come not home:
214    You come not home, because you haue no stomacke:
215    You haue no stomacke, hauing broke your fast:
216    But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
217    Are penitent for your default to day.
218    <S {Ant}.> Stop in your winde sir, tell me this I pray?
219    Where haue you left the mony that I gaue you.
220    <S {E.Dro}.> Oh sixe pence that I had #a wensday last,
221    To pay the Sadler for my Mistris crupper:
222    The Sadler had it Sir, I kept it not.
223    <S {Ant}.> I am not in a sportiue humor now:
224    Tell me, and dally not, where is the monie?
225    We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
226    So great a charge from thine owne custodie.
227    <S {E.Dro}.> I pray you iest sir as you sit at dinner:
228    I from my Mistris come to you in post:
229    If I returne I shall be post indeede.
      <P H2>
230    For she will scoure your fault vpon my pate:
231   *Me thinkes your maw, like mine, should be your cooke,
232    And strike you home without a messenger.
233   *<S {Ant}.> Come {Dromio}, come, these iests are out of season,
234    Reserue them till a merrier houre then this:
235    Where is the gold I gaue in charge to thee?
236    <S {E.Dro}.> To me sir? why you gaue no gold to me?
237   *<S {Ant}.> Come on sir knaue, haue done your foolishnes,
238    And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
239   *<S {E.Dro}.> My charge was but to fetch you fro[m] the Mart
240    Home to your house, the {Phoenix} sir, to dinner;
241    My Mistris and her sister staies for you.
242    <S {Ant}.> Now as I am a Christian answer me,
243    In what safe place you haue bestow'd my monie;
244    Or I shall breake that merrie sconce of yours
245    That stands on tricks, when I am vndispos'd:
246    Where is the thousand Markes thou hadst of me?
247    <S {E.Dro}.> I haue some markes of yours vpon my pate:
248    Some of my Mistris markes vpon my shoulders:
249    But not a thousand markes betweene you both.
250    If I should pay your worship those againe,
251    Perchance you will not beare them patiently.
252   *<S {Ant}.> Thy Mistris markes? what Mistris slaue hast thou?
253   *<S {E.Dro}.> Your worships wife, my Mistris at the {Phoenix};
254    She that doth fast till you come home to dinner:
255    And praies that you will hie you home to dinner.
256    <S {Ant}.> What wilt thou flout me thus vnto my face
257    Being forbid? There take you that sir knaue.
258   *<S {E.Dro}.> What meane you sir, for God sake hold your |(hands:
259    Nay, #and you will not sir, Ile take my heeles.
260    <D {Exeunt Dromio Ep}.>
261    <S {Ant}.> Vpon my life by some deuise or other,
262    The villaine is ore- wrought of all my monie.
263    They say this towne is full of cosenage:
264    As nimble Iuglers that deceiue the eie:
265    Darke working Sorcerers that change the minde:
266    Soule- killing  Witches, that deforme the bodie:
267    Disguised Cheaters, prating Mountebankes;
268    And manie such like liberties of sinne:
269    If it proue so, I will be gone the sooner:
270    Ile to the Centaur to goe seeke this slaue,
271    I greatly feare my monie is not safe.  <D {Exit}.>
272    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
273    <D {Enter Adriana, wife to Antipholis Sereptus, with}
274    {Luciana her Sister}.>
275    <S {Adr}.> Neither my husband nor the slaue return'd,
276    That in such haste I sent to seeke his Master?
277    Sure {Luciana} it is two #a clocke.
278    <S {Luc}.> Perhaps some Merchant hath inuited him,
279    And from the Mart he's somewhere  gone to dinner:
280    Good Sister let vs dine, and neuer fret;
281    A man is Master of his libertie:
282    Time is their Master, and when they see time,
283    They'll goe or come; if so, be patient Sister.
284   *<S {Adr}.> Why should their libertie then ours be more?
285    <S {Luc}.> Because their businesse still lies out #a#dore.
286    <S {Adr}.> Looke when I serue him so, he takes it thus.
287    <S {Luc}.> Oh, know he is the bridle of your #will.
288    <S {Adr}.> There's none but asses will be bridled so.
      <C C>
289    <S {Luc}.> Why, headstrong liberty is lasht with woe:
290    There's nothing situate vnder heauens eye,
291    But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in skie.
292    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowles
293    Are their males subiects, and at their controules:
294    Man more diuine, the Master of all these,
295    Lord of the wide world, and wilde watry seas,
296    Indued with intellectuall sence and soules,
297    Of more preheminence then fish and fowles,
298    Are masters to their females, and their Lords:
299    Then let your #will attend on their accords.
300    <S {Adri}.> This seruitude makes you to keepe vnwed.
301    <S {Luci}.> Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
302   *<S {Adr}.> But were you wedded, you wold bear some sway
303    <S {Luc}.> Ere I learne loue, Ile practise to obey.
304    <S {Adr}.> How if your husband start some other where?
305    <S {Luc}.> Till he come home againe, I would forbeare.
306   *<S {Adr}.> Patience vnmou'd, no maruel though she pause,
307    They can be meeke, that haue no other cause:
308    A wretched soule bruis'd with aduersitie,
309    We bid be quiet when we heare it crie.
310    But were we burdned with like waight of paine,
311    As much, or more, we should our selues complaine:
312    So thou that hast no vnkinde mate to greeue thee,
313    With vrging helpelesse patience would releeue me;
314    But if thou liue to see like right bereft,
315    This foole- beg'd patience in thee will be left.
316    <S {Luci}.> Well, I will marry one day but to trie:
317    Heere comes your man, now is your husband nie.
318    <D {Enter Dromio Eph}.>
319    <S {Adr}.> Say, is your tardie master now at hand?
320   *<S {E.Dro}.> Nay, hee's at #too hands with mee, and that my
321    two eares can witnesse.
322   *<S {Adr}.> Say, didst thou speake with him? knowst thou
323    his minde?
324    <S {E.Dro}.> #I, #I, he told his minde vpon mine eare,
325    Beshrew his hand, I scarce could vnderstand it.
326   *<S {Luc}.> Spake hee so doubtfully, thou couldst not feele
327    his meaning.
328   *<S {E.Dro}.> Nay, hee strooke so plainly, I could too well
329   *feele his blowes; and withall so doubtfully, that I could
330    scarce vnderstand them.
331    <S {Adri}.> But say, I prethee, is he comming home?
332    It seemes he hath great care to please his wife.
333   *<S {E.Dro}.> Why Mistresse, sure my Master is horne mad.
334    <S {Adri}.> Horne mad, thou villaine?
335    <S {E.Dro}.> I meane not Cuckold mad,
336    But sure he is starke mad:
337    When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
338    He ask'd me for a hundred markes in gold:
339    'Tis dinner time, quoth I: my gold, quoth he:
340    Your meat doth burne, quoth I: my gold quoth he:
341    Will you come, quoth I: my gold, quoth he;
342    Where is the thousand markes I gaue thee villaine?
343    The Pigge quoth I, is burn'd: my gold, quoth he:
344    My mistresse, sir, quoth I: hang vp thy Mistresse:
345    I know not thy mistresse, out on thy mistresse.
346    <S {Luci}.> Quoth who?
347   *<S {E.Dr}.> Quoth my Master, I know quoth he, no house,
348   *no wife, no mistresse: so that my arrant due vnto my
349   *tongue, I thanke him, I bare home vpon my shoulders:
350    for in conclusion, he did beat me there.
351   *<S {Adri}.> Go back againe, thou slaue, & fetch him home.
352    <S {Dro}.> Goe backe againe, and be new beaten home?
353    For Gods sake send some other messenger.
      <P H2v>
354   *<S {Adri}.> Backe slaue, or I will breake thy pate a- crosse.
355   *<S {Dro}.> And he will blesse y crosse with other beating:
356    Betweene you, I shall haue a holy head.
357    <S {Adri}.> Hence prating pesant, fetch thy Master home.
358    <S {Dro}.> Am I so round with you, as you with me,
359    That like a foot- ball you doe spurne me thus:
360    You spurne me hence, and he will spurne me hither,
361    If I last in this seruice, you must case me in leather.
362    <S {Luci}.> Fie how impatience lowreth in your face.
363    <S {Adri}.> His company must do his minions grace,
364    Whil'st I at home starue for a merrie looke:
365    Hath homelie age th' alluring beauty tooke
366    From my poore cheeke? then he hath wasted it.
367    Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit,
368    If voluble and sharpe discourse be mar'd,
369    Vnkindnesse blunts it more then marble hard.
370    Doe their gay vestments his affections baite?
371    That's not my fault, hee's master of my state.
372    What ruines are in me that can be found,
373    By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
374    Of my defeatures. My decayed faire,
375    A sunnie looke of his, would soone repaire.
376    But, too vnruly Deere, he breakes the pale,
377    And feedes from home; poore I am but his stale.
378    <S {Luci}.> Selfe- harming Iealousie; fie beat it hence.
379   *<S {Ad}.> Vnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispence:
380    I know his eye doth homage other- where,
381    Or else, what lets it but he would be here?
382    Sister, you know he promis'd me a chaine,
383    Would that alone, a loue he would detaine,
384    So he would keepe faire quarter with his bed:
385    I see the Iewell best enamaled
386    Will loose his beautie: yet the gold bides still
387    That others touch, and often touching will,
388    Where gold and no man that hath a name,
389    By falshood and corruption doth it shame:
390    Since that my beautie cannot please his eie,
391    Ile weepe (what's left away) and weeping die.
392    <S {Luci}.> How manie fond fooles serue mad Ielousie?
393    <D {Exit}.>
394    <D {Enter Antipholis Errotis}.>
395    <S {Ant}.> The gold I gaue to {Dromio} is laid vp
396    Safe at the {Centaur}, and the heedfull slaue
397    Is wandred forth in care to seeke me out
398    By computation and mine hosts report.
399    I could not speake with {Dromio}, since at first
400    I sent him from the Mart? see here he comes.
401    <D {Enter Dromio Siracusia}.>
402    How now sir, is your merrie humor alter'd?
403    As you loue stroakes, so iest with me againe:
404    You know no {Centaur}? you receiu'd no gold?
405    Your Mistresse sent to haue me home to dinner?
406    My house was at the {Phoenix}? Wast thou mad,
407    That thus so madlie thou did didst answere me?
408    <S {S.Dro}.> What answer sir? when spake I such a word?
409   *<S {E.Ant}.> Euen now, euen here, not halfe an howre since.
410    <S {S.Dro}.> I did not see you since you sent me hence
411    Home to the {Centaur} with the gold you gaue me.
412    <S {Ant}.> Villaine, thou didst denie the golds receit,
413    And toldst me of a Mistresse, and a dinner,
414    For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas'd.
415    <S {S.Dro}.> I am glad to see you in this merrie vaine,
416    What meanes this iest, I pray you Master tell me?
417    <S {Ant}.> Yea, dost thou ieere & flowt me in the teeth?
418   *Thinkst y I iest? hold, take thou that, & that.  <D {Beats Dro}.>
419   *<S {S.Dr}.> Hold sir, for Gods sake, now your iest is earnest,
420    Vpon what bargaine do you giue it me?
421    <S {Antiph}.> Because that I familiarlie sometimes
422    Doe vse you for my foole, and chat with you,
423    Your sawcinesse will iest vpon my loue,
424    And make a Common of my serious howres,
425    When the sunne shines, let foolish gnats make sport,
426    But creepe in crannies, when he hides his beames:
427    If you will iest with me, know my aspect,
428    And fashion your demeanor to my lookes,
429    Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
430   *<S {S.Dro}.> Sconce call you it? so you would leaue batte-ring,
431   *I had rather haue it a head, #and you vse these blows
432   *long, I must get a sconce for my head, and Insconce it
433   *#to, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders, but I pray
434    sir, why am I beaten?
435    <S {Ant}.> Dost thou not know?
436    <S {S.Dro}.> Nothing sir, but that I am beaten.
437    <S {Ant}.> Shall I tell you #why?
438   *<S {S.Dro}.> #I sir, and wherefore; for they say, euery #why
439    hath a wherefore.
440   *<S {Ant}.> #Why first for flowting me, and then wherefore,
441    for vrging it the second time to me.
442   *<S {S.Dro}.> Was there euer anie man thus beaten out of
443   *season, when in the #why and the wherefore, is neither
444    rime nor reason. Well sir, I thanke you.
445    <S {Ant}.> Thanke me sir, for what?
446   *<S {S.Dro}.> Marry sir, for this something that you gaue me
447    for nothing.
448   *<S {Ant}.> Ile make you amends next, to giue you nothing
449    for something. But say sir, is it dinner time?
450    <S {S.Dro}.> No sir, I thinke the meat wants that I haue.
451    <S {Ant}.> In good time sir: what's that?
452    <S {S.Dro}.> Basting.
453    <S {Ant}.> Well sir, then 'twill be drie.
454    <S {S.Dro}.> If it be sir, I pray you eat none of it.
455    <S {Ant}.> Your reason?
456   *<S {S.Dro}.> Lest it make you chollericke, and purchase me
457    another drie basting.
458   *<S {Ant}.> Well sir, learne to iest in good time, there's a
459    time for all things.
460   *<S {S.Dro}.> I durst haue denied that before you were so
461    chollericke.
462    <S {Anti}.> By what rule sir?
463   *<S {S.Dro}.> Marry sir, by a rule as plaine as the plaine bald
464    pate of Father time himselfe.
465    <S {Ant}.> Let's heare it.
466   *<S {S.Dro}.> There's no time for a man to recouer his haire
467    that growes bald by nature.
468    <S {Ant}.> May he not doe it by fine and recouerie?
469   *<S {S.Dro}.> Yes, to pay a fine for a perewig, and recouer
470    the lost haire of another man.
471   *<S {Ant}.> Why, is Time such a niggard of haire, being (as
472    it is) so plentifull an excrement?
473   *<S {S.Dro}.> Because it is a blessing that hee bestowes on
474   *beasts, and what he hath scanted them in haire, hee hath
475    giuen them in wit.
476   *<S {Ant}.> Why, but theres manie a man hath more haire
477    then wit.
478   *<S {S.Dro}.> Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose
479    his haire.
480   *<S {Ant}.> Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dea-lers
481    without wit.
482   *<S {S.Dro}.> The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loo-seth
483    it in a kinde of iollitie.
484    <S {An}.> For what reason.
485    <S {S.Dro}.> For two, and sound ones #to.
      <P H3>
486    <S {An}.> Nay not sound I pray you.
487    <S {S.Dro}.> Sure ones then.
488    <S {An}.> Nay, not sure in a thing falsing.
489    <S {S.Dro}.> Certaine ones then.
490    <S {An}.> Name them.
491   *<S {S.Dro}.> The one to saue the money that he spends in
492   *trying: the other, that at dinner they should not drop in
493    his porrage.
494   *<S {An}.> You would all this time haue prou'd, there is no
495    time for all things.
496   *<S {S.Dro}.> Marry and did sir: namely, in no time to re-couer
497    haire lost by Nature.
498   *<S {An}.> But your reason was not substantiall, why there
499    is no time to recouer.
500   *<S {S.Dro}.> Thus I mend it: Time himselfe is bald, and
501    therefore to the worlds end, will haue bald followers.
502   *<S {An}.> I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: but soft,
503    who wafts vs yonder.
504    <D {Enter Adriana and Luciana}.>
505    <S {Adri}.> #I, #I, {Antipholus}, looke strange and frowne,
506    Some other Mistresse hath thy sweet aspects:
507    I am not {Adriana}, nor thy wife.
508    The time was once, when thou vn- vrg'd wouldst vow,
509    That neuer words were musicke to thine eare,
510    That neuer obiect pleasing in thine eye,
511    That neuer touch well welcome to thy hand,
512    That neuer meat sweet- sauour'd in thy taste,
513    Vnlesse I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or caru'd to thee.
514    How comes it now, my Husband, oh how comes it,
515    That thou art then estranged from thy selfe?
516    Thy selfe I call it, being strange to me:
517    That vndiuidable Incorporate
518    Am better then thy deere selfes better part.
519    Ah doe not teare away thy selfe from me;
520    For know my loue: as easie maist thou fall
521    A drop of water in the breaking gulfe,
522    And take vnmingled thence that drop againe
523    Without addition or diminishing,
524    As take from me thy selfe, and not me too.
525    How deerely would it touch thee to the quicke,
526    Shouldst thou but heare I were licencious?
527    And that this body consecrate to thee,
528    By Ruffian Lust should be contaminate?
529    Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurne at me,
530    And hurle the name of husband in my face,
531    And teare the stain'd skin of my Harlot brow,
532    And from my false hand cut the wedding ring,
533    And breake it with a deepe- diuorcing vow?
534    I know thou canst, and therefore see thou doe it.
535    I am possest with an adulterate blot,
536    My bloud is mingled with the crime of lust:
537    For if we two be one, and thou play false,
538    I doe digest the poison of thy flesh,
539    Being strumpeted by thy contagion:
540    Keepe then faire league and truce with thy true bed,
541    I liue distain'd, thou vndishonoured.
542   *<S {Antip}.> Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not:
543    In {Ephesus} I am but two houres old,
544    As strange vnto your towne, as to your talke,
545    Who euery word by all my wit being scan'd,
546    Wants wit in all, one word to vnderstand.
547   *<S {Luci}.> Fie brother, how the world is chang'd with you:
548    When were you wont to vse my sister thus?
549    She sent for you by {Dromio} home to dinner.
      <C D>
550    <S {Ant}.> By {Dromio}? <S {Drom}.> By me.
551   *<S {Adr}.> By thee, and this thou didst returne from him.
552    That he did buffet thee, and in his blowes,
553    Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
554    <S {Ant}.> Did you conuerse sir with this gentlewoman:
555    What is the course and drift of your compact?
556    <S {S.Dro}.> I sir? I neuer saw her till this time.
557    <S {Ant}.> Villaine thou liest, for euen her verie words,
558    Didst thou deliuer to me on the Mart.
559    <S {S.Dro}.> I neuer spake with her in all my life.
560    <S {Ant}.> How can she thus then call vs by our names?
561    Vnlesse it be by inspiration.
562    <S {Adri}.> How #ill agrees it with your grauitie,
563    To counterfeit thus grosely with your slaue,
564    Abetting him to thwart me in my moode;
565    Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt,
566    But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
567    Come I will fasten on this sleeue of thine:
568    Thou art an Elme my husband, I a Vine:
569    Whose weaknesse married to thy stranger state,
570    Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
571    If ought possesse thee from me, it is drosse,
572    Vsurping Iuie, Brier, or idle Mosse,
573    Who all for want of pruning, with intrusion,
574    Infect thy sap, and liue on thy confusion.
575   *<S {Ant}.> To mee shee speakes, shee moues mee for her
576    theame;
577    What, was I married to her in my dreame?
578    Or sleepe I now, and thinke I heare all this?
579    What error driues our eies and eares amisse?
580    Vntill I know this sure vncertaintie,
581    Ile entertaine the free'd fallacie.
582    <S {Luc}.> {Dromio}, goe bid the seruants spred for dinner.
583    <S {S.Dro}.> Oh for my beads, I crosse me for a sinner.
584    This is the Fairie land, oh spight of spights,
585    We talke with Goblins, Owles and Sprights;
586    If we obay them not, this will insue:
587    They'll sucke our breath, or pinch vs blacke and blew.
588   *<S {Luc}.> Why prat'st thou to thy selfe, and answer'st not?
589    {Dromio}, thou {Dromio}, thou snaile, thou slug, thou sot.
590    <S {S.Dro}.> I am transformed Master, am I not?
591    <S {Ant}.> I thinke thou art in minde, and so am I.
592    <S {S.Dro}.> Nay Master, both in minde, and in my shape.
593    <S {Ant}.> Thou hast thine owne forme.
594    <S {S.Dro}.> No, I am an Ape.
595    <S {Luc}.> If thou art chang'd to ought, 'tis to an Asse.
596    <S {S.Dro}.> 'Tis true she rides me, and I long for grasse.
597    'Tis so, I am an Asse, else it could neuer be,
598    But I should know her as well as she knowes me.
599    <S {Adr}.> Come, come, no longer will I be a foole,
600    To put the finger in the eie and weepe;
601    Whil'st man and Master laughes my woes to scorne:
602    Come sir to dinner, {Dromio} keepe the gate:
603    Husband Ile dine aboue with you to day,
604    And shriue you of a thousand idle prankes:
605    Sirra, if any aske you for your Master,
606    Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter:
607    Come sister, {Dromio} play the Porter well.
608    <S {Ant}.> Am I in earth, in heauen, or in #hell?
609    Sleeping or waking, mad or well aduisde:
610    Knowne vnto these, and to my selfe disguisde:
611    Ile say as they say, and perseuer so:
612    And in this mist at all aduentures go.
613    <S {S.Dro}.> Master, shall I be Porter at the gate?
614    <S {Adr}.> #I, and let none enter, least I breake your pate.
615    <S {Luc}.> Come, come, {Antipholus}, we dine #to late.
      <P H3v>
616    <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
617   *<D {Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio, Angelo the}
618    {Goldsmith, and Balthaser the Merchant}.>
619   *<S {E.Anti}.> Good signior {Angelo} you must excuse vs all,
620    My wife is shrewish when I keepe not howres;
621    Say that I lingerd with you at your shop
622    To see the making of her Carkanet,
623    And that to morrow you will bring it home.
624    But here's a villaine that would face me downe
625    He met me on the Mart, and that I beat him,
626    And charg'd him with a thousand markes in gold,
627    And that I did denie my wife and house;
628    Thou drunkard thou, what didst thou meane by this?
629   *<S {E.Dro}.> Say what you wil sir, but I know what I know,
630   *That you beat me at the Mart I haue your hand to show;
631   *If y skin were parchment, & y blows you gaue were ink,
632   *Your owne hand- writing would tell you what I thinke.
633    <S {E.Ant}.> I thinke thou art an asse.
634    <S {E.Dro}.> Marry so it doth appeare
635    By the wrongs I suffer, and the blowes I beare,
636    I should kicke being kickt, and being at that passe,
637    You would keepe from my heeles, and beware of an asse.
638   *<S {E.An}.> Y'are sad signior {Balthazar}, pray God our cheer
639   *May answer my good #will, and your good welcom here.
640   *<S {Bal}.> I hold your dainties cheap sir, & your welcom deer.
641    <S {E.An}.> Oh signior {Balthazar}, either at flesh or fish,
642    A table full of welcome, makes scarce one dainty dish.
643   *<S {Bal}.> Good meat sir is co[m]mon that euery churle affords.
644   *<S {Anti}.> And welcome more common, for thats nothing
645    but words.
646   *<S {Bal}.> Small cheere and great welcome, makes a mer-rie
647    feast.
648   *<S {Anti}.> #I, to a niggardly Host, and more sparing guest:
649   *But though my cates be meane, take them in good part,
650    Better cheere may you haue, but not with better hart.
651    But soft, my doore is lockt; goe bid them let vs in.
652    <S {E.Dro}.> {Maud, Briget, Marian, Cisley, Gillian, Ginn}.
653   *<S {S.Dro}.> Mome, Malthorse, Capon, Coxcombe, Idi-ot,
654    Patch,
655   *Either get thee from the dore, or sit downe at the hatch:
656   *Dost thou coniure for wenches, that y calst for such store,
657   *When one is one too many, goe get thee from the dore.
658   *<S {E.Dro}.> What patch is made our Porter? my Master
659    stayes in the street.
660   *<S {S.Dro}.> Let him walke from whence he came, lest hee
661    catch cold on's feet.
662   *<S {E.Ant}.> Who talks within there? hoa, open the dore.
663   *<S {S.Dro}.> Right sir, Ile tell you when, and you'll tell
664    me wherefore.
665   *<S {Ant}.> Wherefore? for my dinner: I haue not din'd to
666    day.
667   *<S {S.Dro}.> Nor to day here you must not come againe
668    when you may.
669   *<S {Anti}.> What art thou that keep'st mee out from the
670    howse I owe?
671   *<S {S.Dro}.> The Porter for this time Sir, and my name is
672    {Dromio}.
673   *<S {E.Dro}.> O villaine, thou hast stolne both mine office
674    and my name,
675    The one nere got me credit, the other mickle blame:
676    If thou hadst beene {Dromio} to day in my place,
677   *Thou wouldst haue chang'd thy face for a name, or thy
678    name for an asse.
679    <D {Enter Luce}.>
680   *<S {Luce}.> What a coile is there {Dromio}? who are those
681    at the gate?
682    <S {E.Dro}.> Let my Master in {Luce}.
683   *<S {Luce}.> Faith no, hee comes too late, and so tell your
684    Master.
685   *<S {E.Dro}.> O Lord I must laugh, haue at you with a Pro-uerbe,
686   _
687    Shall I set in my staffe.
688   *<S {Luce}.> Haue at you with another, that's when? can
689    you tell?
690   *<S {S.Dro}.> If thy name be called {Luce}, {Luce} thou hast an-swer'd
691    him well.
692   *<S {Anti}.> Doe you heare you minion, you'll let vs in I
693    hope?
694    <S {Luce}.> I thought to haue askt you.
695    <S {S.Dro}.> And you said no.
696   *<S {E.Dro}.> So come helpe, well strooke, there was blow
697    for blow.
698    <S {Anti}.> Thou baggage let me in.
699    <S {Luce}.> Can you tell for whose sake?
700    <S {E.Drom}.> Master, knocke the doore hard.
701    <S {Luce}.> Let him knocke till it ake.
702   *<S {Anti}.> You'll crie for this minion, if I beat the doore
703    downe.
704   *<S {Luce}.> What needs all that, and a paire of stocks in the
705    towne?
706    <D {Enter Adriana}.>
707   *<S {Adr}.> Who is that at the doore y keeps all this noise?
708   *<S {S.Dro}.> By my troth your towne is troubled with vn-ruly
709    boies.
710   *<S {Anti}.> Are you there Wife? you might haue come
711    before.
712   *<S {Adri}.> Your wife sir knaue? go get you from the dore.
713   *<S {E.Dro}.> If you went in paine Master, this knaue wold
714    goe sore.
715   *<S {Angelo}.> Heere is neither cheere sir, nor welcome, we
716    would faine haue either.
717   *<S {Baltz}.> In debating which was best, wee shall part
718    with neither.
719   *<S {E.Dro}.> They stand at the doore, Master, bid them
720    welcome hither.
721   *<S {Anti}.> There is something in the winde, that we can-not
722    get in.
723   *<S {E.Dro}.> You would say so Master, if your garments
724    were thin.
725   *Your cake here is warme within: you stand here in the
726    cold.
727   *It would make a man mad as a Bucke to be so bought
728    and sold.
729   *<S {Ant}.> Go fetch me something, Ile break ope the gate.
730   *<S {S.Dro}.> Breake any breaking here, and Ile breake your
731    knaues pate.
732   *<S {E.Dro}.> A man may breake a word with your sir, and
733    words are but winde:
734    #I and breake it in your face, so he break it not behinde.
735   *<S {S.Dro}.> It seemes thou want'st breaking, out vpon thee
736    hinde.
737   *<S {E.Dro}.> Here's too much out vpon thee, I pray thee let
738    me in.
739   *<S {S.Dro}.> #I, when fowles haue no feathers, and fish haue
740    no fin.
741    <S {Ant}.> Well, Ile breake in: go borrow me a crow.
742   *<S {E.Dro}.> A crow without feather, Master meane you so;
      <P H4><C C>
743   *For a fish without a finne, ther's a fowle without a fether,
744   *If a crow help vs in sirra, wee'll plucke a crow together.
745    <S {Ant}.> Go, get thee gon, fetch me an iron Crow.
746    <S {Balth}.> Haue patience sir, oh let it not be so,
747    Heerein you warre against your reputation,
748    And draw within the compasse of suspect
749    Th' vnuiolated  honor of your wife.
750    Once this your long experience of your wisedome,
751    Her sober vertue, yeares, and modestie,
752    Plead on your part some cause to you vnknowne;
753    And doubt not sir, but she will well excuse
754    Why at this time the dores are made against you.
755    Be rul'd by me, depart in patience,
756    And let vs to the Tyger all to dinner,
757    And about euening come your selfe alone,
758    To know the reason of this strange restraint:
759    If by strong hand you offer to breake in
760    Now in the stirring passage of the day,
761    A vulgar comment will be made of it;
762    And that supposed by the common rowt
763    Against your yet vngalled estimation,
764    That may with foule intrusion enter in,
765    And dwell vpon your graue when you are dead;
766    For slander liues vpon succession:
767    For euer hows'd, where it gets possession.
768    <S {Anti}.> You haue preuail'd, I will depart in quiet,
769    And in despight of mirth meane to be merrie:
770    I know a wench of excellent discourse,
771    Prettie and wittie; wilde, and yet too gentle;
772    There will we dine: this woman that I meane
773    My wife (but I protest without desert)
774    Hath oftentimes vpbraided me withall:
775    To her will we to dinner, get you home
776    And fetch the chaine, by this I know 'tis made,
777    Bring it I pray you to the {Porpentine},
778    For there's the house: That chaine will I bestow
779    (Be it for nothing but to spight my wife)
780    Vpon mine hostesse there, good sir make haste:
781    Since mine owne doores refuse to entertaine me,
782    Ile knocke else- where, to see if they'll disdaine me.
783    <S {Ang}.> Ile meet you at that place some houre hence.
784    <S {Anti}.> Do so, this iest shall cost me some expence.
785    <D {Exeunt}.>
786    <D {Enter Iuliana, with Antipholus of Siracusia}.>
787    <S {Iulia}.> And may it be that you haue quite forgot
788    A husbands office? shall {Antipholus}
789    Euen in the spring of Loue, thy Loue- springs rot?
790    Shall loue in buildings grow so ruinate?
791    If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
792   *Then for her wealths- sake vse her with more kindnesse:
793    Or if you like else- where doe it by stealth,
794    Muffle your false loue with some shew of blindnesse:
795    Let not my sister read it in your eye:
796    Be not thy tongue thy owne shames Orator:
797    Looke sweet, speake faire, become disloyaltie:
798    Apparell vice like vertues harbenger:
799    Beare a faire presence, though your heart be tainted,
800    Teach sinne the carriage of a holy Saint,
801    Be secret false: what need she be acquainted?
802    What simple thiefe brags of his owne attaine?
803    'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,
804    And let her read it in thy lookes at boord:
805    Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed,
806    #Ill deeds is doubled with an euill word:
807    Alas poore women, make vs not beleeue
808    (Being compact of credit) that you loue vs,
      <C D>
809    Though others haue the arme, shew vs the sleeue:
810    We in your motion turne, and you may moue vs.
811    Then gentle brother get you in againe;
812    Comfort my sister, cheere her, call her wise;
813    'Tis holy sport to be a little vaine,
814    When the sweet breath of flatterie conquers strife.
815   *<S {S.Anti}.> Sweete Mistris, what your name is else I
816    know not;
817    Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine:
818   *Lesse in your knowledge, and your grace you show not,
819    Then our earths wonder, more then earth diuine.
820    Teach me deere creature how to thinke and speake:
821    Lay open to my earthie grosse conceit:
822    Smothred in errors, feeble, shallow, weake,
823    The foulded meaning of your words deceit:
824    Against my soules pure truth, why labour you,
825    To make it wander in an vnknowne field?
826    Are you a god? would you create me new?
827    Transforme me then, and to your powre Ile yeeld.
828    But if that I am I, then well I know,
829    Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
830    Nor to her bed no homage doe I owe:
831    Farre more, farre more, to you doe I decline:
832    Oh traine me not sweet Mermaide with thy note,
833    To drowne me in thy sister floud of teares:
834    Sing Siren for thy selfe, and I will dote:
835    Spread ore the siluer waues thy golden haires;
836    And as a bud Ile take thee, and there lie:
837    And in that glorious supposition thinke,
838    He gaines by death, that hath such meanes to die:
839    Let Loue, being light, be drowned if she sinke.
840    <S {Luc}.> What are you mad, that you doe reason so?
841    <S {Ant}.> Not mad, but mated, how I doe not know.
842    <S {Luc}.> It is a fault that springeth from your eie.
843   *<S {Ant}.> For gazing on your beames faire sun being by.
844   *<S {Luc}.> Gaze when you should, and that will cleere
845    your sight.
846   *<S {Ant}.> As good to winke sweet loue, as looke on night.
847    <S {Luc}.> Why call you me loue? Call my sister so.
848    <S {Ant}.> Thy sisters sister.
849    <S {Luc}.> That's my sister.
850   *<S {Ant}.> No: it is thy selfe, mine owne selfes better part:
851    Mine eies cleere eie, my deere hearts deerer heart;
852    My foode, my fortune, and my sweet hopes aime;
853    My sole earths heauen, and my heauens claime.
854    <S {Luc}.> All this my sister is, or else should be.
855    <S {Ant}.> Call thy selfe sister sweet, for I am thee:
856    Thee will I loue, and with thee lead my life;
857    Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife:
858    Giue me thy hand.
859    <S {Luc}.> Oh soft sir, hold you still:
860    Ile fetch my sister to get her good #will.  <D {Exit}.>
861    <D {Enter Dromio, Siracusia}.>
862   *<S {Ant}.> Why how now {Dromio}, where run'st thou so
863    fast?
864   *<S {S.Dro}.> Doe you know me sir? Am I {Dromio}? Am I
865    your man? Am I my selfe?
866   *<S {Ant}.> Thou art {Dromio}, thou art my man, thou art
867    thy selfe.
868   *<S {Dro}.> I am an asse, I am a womans man, and besides
869    my selfe.
870   *<S {Ant}.> What womans man? and how besides thy
871    selfe?
872   *<S {Dro}.> Marrie sir, besides my selfe, I am due to a woman:
873   *One that claimes me, one that haunts me, one that will
874    haue me.
      <P H4v><C B>
875    <S {Anti}.> What claime laies she to thee?
876   *<S {Dro}.> Marry sir, such claime as you would lay to your
877   *horse, and she would haue me as a beast, not that I bee-ing
878   *a beast she would haue me, but that she being a ve-rie
879    beastly creature layes claime to me.
880    <S {Anti}.> What is she?
881   *<S {Dro}.> A very reuerent body: #I such a one, as a man
882   *may not speake of, without he say sir reuerence, I haue
883   *but leane lucke in the match, and yet is she a wondrous
884    fat marriage.
885    <S {Anti}.> How dost thou meane a fat marriage?
886   *<S {Dro}.> Marry sir, she's the Kitchin wench, & al grease,
887   *and I know not what vse to put her #too, but to make a
888   *Lampe of her, and run from her by her owne light. I
889   *warrant, her ragges and the Tallow in them, will burne
890   *a {Poland} Winter: If she liues till doomesday, she'l burne
891    a weeke longer then the whole World.
892    <S {Anti}.> What complexion is she of?
893   *<S {Dro}.> Swart like my shoo, but her face nothing like
894   *so cleane kept: for why? she sweats a man may goe o-uer- shooes
895    in the grime of it.
896    <S {Anti}.> That's a fault that water will mend.
897   *<S {Dro}.> No sir, 'tis in graine, {Noahs} flood could not
898    do it.
899    <S {Anti}.> What's her name?
900   *<S {Dro}.> {Nell} Sir: but her name is three quarters, that's
901   *an Ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip
902    to hip.
903    <S {Anti}.> Then she beares some bredth?
904   *<S {Dro}.> No longer from head to foot, then from hippe
905   *to hippe: she is sphericall, like a globe: I could find out
906    Countries in her.
907    <S {Anti}.> In what part of her body stands {Ireland}?
908   *<S {Dro}.> Marry sir in her buttockes, I found it out by
909    the bogges.
910    <S {Ant}.> Where {Scotland}?
911   *<S {Dro}.> I found it by the barrennesse, hard in the palme
912    of the hand.
913    <S {Ant}.> Where {France}?
914   *<S {Dro}.> In her forhead, arm'd and reuerted, making
915    warre against her heire.
916    <S {Ant}.> Where {England}?
917   *<S {Dro}.> I look'd for the chalkle Cliffes, but I could find
918   *no whitenesse in them. But I guesse, it stood in her chin
919    by the salt rheume that ranne betweene {France}, and it.
920    <S {Ant}.> Where {Spaine}?
921   *<S {Dro}.> Faith I saw it not: but I felt it hot in her breth.
922    <S {Ant}.> Where {America}, the {Indies}?
923    <S {Dro}.> Oh sir, vpon her nose, all ore embellished with
924   *Rubies, Carbuncles, Saphires, declining their rich As-pect
925   *to the hot breath of Spaine, who sent whole Ar-madoes
926    of Carrects to be ballast at her nose.
927    <S {Anti}.> Where stood {Belgia}, the {Netherlands}?
928   *<S {Dro}.> Oh sir, I did not looke so low. To conclude,
929   *this drudge or Diuiner layd claime to mee, call'd mee
930   *{Dromio}, swore I was assur'd to her, told me what priuie
931   *markes I had about mee, as the marke of my shoulder,
932   *the Mole in my necke, the great Wart on my left arme,
933   *that I amaz'd ranne from her as a witch. And I thinke, if
934   *my brest had not beene made of faith, and my heart of
935   *steele, she had transform'd me to a Curtull dog, & made
936    me turne i'th wheele.
937    <S {Anti}.> Go hie thee presently, post to the rode,
938    And if the winde blow any way from shore,
939    I will not harbour in this Towne to night.
940    If any Barke put forth, come to the Mart,
941    Where I will walke till thou returne to me:
942    If euerie one knowes vs, and we know none,
943    'Tis time I thinke to trudge, packe, and be gone.
944    <S {Dro}.> As from a Beare a man would run for life,
945    So flie I from her that would be my wife.  <D {Exit}>
946    <S {Anti}.> There's none but Witches do inhabite heere,
947    And therefore 'tis hie time that I were hence:
948    She that doth call me husband, euen my soule
949    Doth for a wife abhorre. But her faire sister
950    Possest with such a gentle soueraigne grace,
951    Of such inchanting presence and discourse,
952    Hath almost made me Traitor to my selfe:
953    But least my selfe be guilty to selfe wrong,
954    Ile stop mine eares against the Mermaids song.
955    <D {Enter Angelo with the Chaine}.>
956    <S {Ang}.> Mr  {Antipholus}.
957    <S {Anti}.> #I that's my name.
958    <S {Ang}.> I know it well sir, loe here's the chaine,
959    I thought to haue tane you at the {Porpentine},
960    The chaine vnfinish'd made me stay thus long.
961    <S {Anti}.> What is your #will that I shal do with this?
962   *<S {Ang}.> What please your selfe sir: I haue made it for
963    you.
964    <S {Anti}.> Made it for me sir, I bespoke it not.
965   *<S {Ang}.> Not once, nor twice, but twentie times you
966    haue:
967    Go home with it, and please your Wife withall,
968    And soone at supper time Ile visit you,
969    And then receiue my money for the chaine.
970    <S {Anti}.> I pray you sir receiue the money now.
971    For feare you ne're see chaine, nor mony more.
972    <S {Ang}.> You are a merry man sir, fare you well.  <D {Exit}.>
973    <S {Ant}.> What I should thinke of this, I cannot tell:
974    But this I thinke, there's no man is so vaine,
975    That would refuse so faire an offer'd Chaine.
976    I see a man heere needs not liue by shifts,
977    When in the streets he meetes such Golden gifts:
978    Ile to the Mart, and there for {Dromio} stay,
979    If any ship put out, then straight away.  <D {Exit}.>
980    <Z {Actus Quartus. Scoena Prima}.>
981    <D {Enter a Merchant, Goldsmith, and an Officer}.>
982    <S {Mar}.> You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
983    And since I haue not much importun'd you,
984    Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
985    To {Persia}, and want Gilders for my voyage:
986    Therefore make present satisfaction,
987    Or Ile attach you by this Officer.
988    <S {Gold}.> Euen iust the sum that I do owe to you,
989    Is growing to me by {Antipholus},
990    And in the instant that I met with you,
991    He had of me a Chaine, at fiue #a clocke
992    I shall receiue the money for the same:
993    Pleaseth you walke with me downe to his house,
994    I will discharge my bond, and thanke you too.
995    <D {Enter Antipholus Ephes.#Dromio from the Courtizans}.>
996   *<S {Offi}.> That labour may you saue: See where he comes.
997   *<S {Ant}.> While I go to the Goldsmiths house, go thou
      <P H5>
998    And buy a ropes end, that will I bestow
999    Among my wife, and their confederates,
1000   For locking me out of my doores by day:
1001   But soft I see the Goldsmith; get thee gone,
1002   Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
1003   <S {Dro}.> I buy a thousand pound a yeare, I buy a rope.
1004   <D {Exit Dromio}>
1005  *<S {Eph.Ant}.> A man is well holpe vp that trusts to you,
1006   I promised your presence, and the Chaine,
1007   But neither Chaine nor Goldsmith came to me:
1008   Belike you thought our loue would last too long
1009   If it were chain'd together: and therefore came not.
1010   <S {Gold}.> Sauing your merrie humor: here's the note
1011  *How much your Chaine weighs to the vtmost charect,
1012   The finenesse of the Gold, and chargefull fashion,
1013   Which doth amount to three odde Duckets more
1014   Then I stand debted to this Gentleman,
1015   I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
1016   For he is bound to Sea, and stayes but for it.
1017   <S {Anti}.> I am not furnish'd with the present monie:
1018   Besides I haue some businesse in the towne,
1019   Good Signior take the stranger to my house,
1020   And with you take the Chaine, and bid my wife
1021   Disburse the summe, on the receit thereof,
1022   Perchance I will be there as soone as you.
1023  *<S {Gold}.> Then you will bring the Chaine to her your
1024   selfe.
1025  *<S {Anti}.> No beare it with you, least I come not time e-nough.
1026  _
1027  *<S {Gold}.> Well sir, I will? Haue you the Chaine about
1028   you?
1029   <S {Ant}.> #And if I haue not sir, I hope you haue:
1030   Or else you may returne without your money.
1031  *<S {Gold}.> Nay come I pray you sir, giue me the Chaine:
1032   Both winde and tide stayes for this Gentleman,
1033   And I #too blame haue held him heere too long.
1034  *<S {Anti}.> Good Lord, you vse this dalliance to excuse
1035   Your breach of promise to the {Porpentine},
1036   I should haue chid you for not bringing it,
1037   But like a shrew you first begin to brawle.
1038   <S {Mar}.> The houre steales on, I pray you sir dispatch.
1039  *<S {Gold}.> You heare how he importunes me, the Chaine.
1040  *<S {Ant}.> Why giue it to my wife, and fetch your mony.
1041  *<S {Gold}.> Come, come, you know I gaue it you euen now.
1042   Either send the Chaine, or send me by some token.
1043   <S {Ant}.> Fie, now you run this humor out of breath,
1044   Come where's the Chaine, I pray you let me see it.
1045   <S {Mar}.> My businesse cannot brooke this dalliance,
1046   Good sir say, #whe'r you'l answer me, or no:
1047   If not, Ile leaue him to the Officer.
1048   <S {Ant}.> I answer you? What should I answer you.
1049   <S {Gold}.> The monie that you owe me for the Chaine.
1050   <S {Ant}.> I owe you none, till I receiue the Chaine.
1051   <S {Gold}.> You know I gaue it you halfe an houre since.
1052  *<S {Ant}.> You gaue me none, you wrong mee much to
1053   say so.
1054   <S {Gold}.> You wrong me more sir in denying it.
1055   Consider how it stands vpon my credit.
1056   <S {Mar}.> Well Officer, arrest him at my suite.
1057  *<S {Offi}.> I do, and charge you in the Dukes name to o-bey
1058   me.
1059   <S {Gold}.> This touches me in reputation.
1060   Either consent to pay this sum for me,
1061   Or I attach you by this Officer.
1062   <S {Ant}.> Consent to pay thee that I neuer had:
1063   Arrest me foolish fellow if thou dar'st.
1064   <S {Gold}.> Heere is thy fee, arrest him Officer.
1065   I would not spare my brother in this case,
1066   If he should scorne me so apparantly.
1067   <S {Offic}.> I do arrest you sir, you heare the suite.
1068   <S {Ant}.> I do obey thee, till I giue thee baile.
1069   But sirrah, you shall buy this sport as deere,
1070   As all the mettall in your shop will answer.
1071   <S {Gold}.> Sir, sir, I shall haue Law in {Ephesus},
1072   To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
1073   <D {Enter Dromio Sira. from the Bay}.>
1074   <S {Dro}.> Master, there's a Barke of {Epidamium},
1075   That staies but till her Owner comes aboord,
1076   And then sir she beares away. Our fraughtage sir,
1077   I haue conuei'd aboord, and I haue bought
1078   The Oyle, the {Balsamum}, and Aqua- vitae.
1079   The ship is in her trim, the merrie winde
1080   Blowes faire from land: they stay for nought at all,
1081   But for their Owner, Master, and your selfe.
1082  *<S {An}.> How now? a Madman? Why thou peeuish sheep
1083   What ship of {Epidamium} staies for me.
1084   <S {S.Dro}.> A ship you sent me #too, to hier waftage.
1085   <S {Ant}.> Thou drunken slaue, I sent thee for a rope,
1086   And told thee to what purpose, and what end.
1087   <S {S.Dro}.> You sent me for a ropes end as soone,
1088   You sent me to the Bay sir, for a Barke.
1089   <S {Ant}.> I will debate this matter at more leisure
1090   And teach your eares to list me with more heede:
1091   To {Adriana} Villaine hie thee straight:
1092   Giue her this key, and tell her in the Deske
1093   That's couer'd o're with Turkish Tapistrie,
1094   There is a purse of Duckets, let her send it:
1095   Tell her, I am arrested in the streete,
1096   And that shall baile me: hie thee slaue, be gone,
1097   On Officer to prison, till it come.  <D {Exeunt}>
1098   <S {S.Dromio}.> To {Adriana}, that is where we din'd,
1099   Where Dowsabell did claime me for her husband,
1100   She is too bigge I hope for me to compasse,
1101   Thither I must, although against my #will:
1102   For seruants must their Masters mindes fulfill.  <D {Exit}>
1103   <D {Enter Adriana} and {Luciana}.>
1104   <S {Adr}.> Ah {Luciana}, did he tempt thee so?
1105   Might'st thou perceiue austeerely in his eie,
1106   That he did plead in earnest, yea or no:
1107   Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
1108   What obseruation mad'st thou in this case?
1109   Oh, his hearts Meteors tilting in his face.
1110   <S {Luc}.> First he deni'de you had in him no right.
1111  *<S {Adr}.> He meant he did me none: the more my spight
1112   <S {Luc}.> Then swore he that he was a stranger heere.
1113  *<S {Adr}.> And true he swore, though yet forsworne hee
1114   were.
1115   <S {Luc}.> Then pleaded I for you.
1116   <S {Adr}.> And what said he?
1117   <S {Luc}.> That loue I begg'd for you, he begg'd of me.
1118  *<S {Adr}.> With what perswasion did he tempt thy loue?
1119  *<S {Luc}.> With words, that in an honest suit might moue.
1120   First, he did praise my beautie, then my speech.
1121   <S {Adr}.> Did'st speake him faire?
1122   <S {Luc}.> Haue patience I beseech.
1123   <S {Adr}.> I cannot, nor I will not hold me still.
1124   My tongue, though not my heart, shall haue his #will.
1125   He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
1126   Ill- fac'd, worse bodied, shapelesse euery where:
1127   Vicious, vngentle, foolish, blunt, vnkinde,
      <P H5v><C D>
1128   Stigmaticall in making worse in minde.
1129   <S {Luc}.> Who would be iealous then of such a one?
1130   No euill lost is wail'd, when it is gone.
1131   <S {Adr}.> Ah but I thinke him better then I say:
1132   And yet would herein others eies were worse:
1133   Farre from her nest the Lapwing cries away;
1134   My heart praies for him, though my tongue doe curse.
1135   <D {Enter S.Dromio}.>
1136  *<S {Dro}.> Here goe: the deske, the purse, sweet now make
1137   haste.
1138   <S {Luc}.> How hast thou lost thy breath?
1139   <S {S.Dro}.> By running fast.
1140   <S {Adr}.> Where is thy Master {Dromio}? Is he well?
1141   <S {S.Dro}.> No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse then #hell:
1142   A diuell in an euerlasting garment hath him;
1143   On whose hard heart is button'd vp with steele:
1144   A Feind, a Fairie, pittilesse and ruffe:
1145   A Wolfe, nay worse, a fellow all in buffe:
1146  *A back friend, a shoulder- clapper, one that counterma[n]ds
1147   The passages of allies, creekes, and narrow lands:
1148   A hound that runs Counter, and yet draws drifoot well,
1149  *One that before the Iudgme[n]t carries poore soules to #hel.
1150   <S {Adr}.> Why man, what is the matter?
1151  *<S {S.Dro}.> I doe not know the matter, hee is rested on
1152   the case.
1153   <S {Adr}.> What is he arrested? tell me at whose suite?
1154  *<S {S.Dro}.> I know not at whose suite he is arested well;
1155  *but is in a suite of buffe which rested him, that can I tell,
1156  *will you send him Mistris redemption, the monie in
1157   his deske.
1158   <S {Adr}.> Go fetch it Sister: this I wonder at.
1159   <D {Exit Luciana}.>
1160   Thus he vnknowne to me should be in debt:
1161   Tell me, was he arested on a band?
1162   <S {S.Dro}.> Not on a band, but on a stronger thing:
1163   A chaine, a chaine, doe you not #here it ring.
1164   <S {Adria}.> What, the chaine?
1165   <S {S.Dro}.> No, no, the bell, 'tis time that I were gone:
1166  *It was two ere I left him, and now the clocke strikes one.
1167   <S {Adr}.> The houres come backe, that did I neuer #here.
1168  *<S {S.Dro}.> Oh yes, if any houre meete a Serieant, #a turnes
1169   backe for verie feare.
1170  *<S {Adri}.> As if time were in debt: how fondly do'st thou
1171   reason?
1172  *<S {S.Dro}.> Time is a verie bankerout, and owes more then
1173   he's worth to season.
1174   Nay, he's a theefe too: haue you not heard men say,
1175   That time comes stealing on by night and day?
1176   If I be in debt and theft, and a Serieant in the way,
1177   Hath he not reason to turne backe an houre in a day?
1178   <D {Enter Luciana}.>
1179  *<S {Adr}.> Go {Dromio}, there's the monie, beare it straight,
1180   And bring thy Master home imediately.
1181   Come sister, I am prest downe with conceit:
1182   Conceit, my comfort and my iniurie.  <D {Exit}.>
1183   <D {Enter Antipholus Siracusia}.>
1184   There's not a man I meete but doth salute me
1185   As if I were their well acquainted friend,
1186   And euerie one doth call me by my name:
1187   Some tender monie to me, some inuite me;
1188   Some other giue me thankes for kindnesses;
1189   Some offer me Commodities to buy.
1190   Euen now a tailor cal'd me in his shop,
1191   And show'd me Silkes that he had bought for me,
1192   And therewithall tooke measure of my body.
1193   Sure these are but imaginarie wiles,
1194   And lapland Sorcerers inhabite here.
1195   <D {Enter Dromio. #Sir}.>
1196  *<S {S.Dro}.> Master, here's the gold you sent me for: what
1197   haue you got the picture of old {Adam} new apparel'd?
1198  *<S {Ant}.> What gold is this? What {Adam} do'st thou
1199   meane?
1200  *<S {S.Dro}.> Not that {Adam} that kept the Paradise: but
1201  *that {Adam} that keepes the prison; hee that goes in the
1202  *calues- skin, that was kil'd for the Prodigall: hee that
1203  *came behinde you sir, like an euill angel, and bid you for-sake
1204   your libertie.
1205   <S {Ant}.> I vnderstand thee not.
1206  *<S {S.Dro}.> No? why 'tis a plaine case: he that went like
1207  *a Base- Viole in a case of leather; the man sir, that when
1208  *gentlemen are tired giues them a sob, and rests them:
1209  *he sir, that takes pittie on decaied men, and giues them
1210  *suites of durance: he that sets vp his rest to doe more ex-ploits
1211   with his Mace, then a Moris Pike.
1212   <S {Ant}.> What thou mean'st an officer?
1213  *<S {S.Dro}.> #I sir, the Serieant of the Band: he that brings
1214  *any man to answer it that breakes his Band: one that
1215  *thinkes a man alwaies going to bed, and saies, God giue
1216   you good rest.
1217   <S {Ant}.> Well sir, there rest in your foolerie:
1218  *Is there any ships puts forth to night? may we be gone?
1219  *<S {S.Dro}.> Why sir, I brought you word an houre since,
1220  *that the Barke {Expedition} put forth to night, and then
1221  *were you hindred by the Serieant to tarry for the {Hoy}
1222  *{Delay}: Here are the angels that you sent for to deliuer
1223   you.
1224   <S {Ant}.> The fellow is distract, and so am I,
1225   And here we wander in illusions:
1226   Some blessed power deliuer vs from hence.
1227   <D {Enter a Curtizan}.>
1228   <S {Cur}.> Well met, well met, Master {Antipholus}:
1229   I see sir you haue found the Gold- smith now:
1230   Is that the chaine you promis'd me to day.
1231   <S {Ant}.> Sathan auoide, I charge thee tempt me not.
1232   <S {S.Dro}.> Master, is this Mistris {Sathan}?
1233   <S {Ant}.> It is the diuell.
1234   <S {S.Dro}.> Nay, she is worse, she is the diuels dam:
      <C C>
1235  *And here she comes in the habit of a light wench, and
1236  *thereof comes, that the wenches say God dam me, That's
1237  *as much to say, God make me a light wench: It is writ-ten,
1238  *they appeare to men like angels of light, light is an
1239  *effect of fire, and fire will burne: {ergo}, light wenches will
1240   burne, come not neere her.
1241   <S {Cur}.> Your man and you are maruailous merrie sir.
1242   Will you goe with me, wee'll mend our dinner here?
1243  *<S {S.Dro}.> Master, if do expect spoon- meate, or bespeake
1244   a long spoone.
1245   <S {Ant}.> Why {Dromio}?
1246  *<S {S.Dro}.> Marrie he must haue a long spoone that must
1247   eate with the diuell.
1248  *<S {Ant}.> Auoid then fiend, what tel'st thou me of sup-|(ping?
1249   Thou art, as you are all a sorceresse:
1250   I coniure thee to leaue me, and be gon.
1251   <S {Cur}.> Giue me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
1252   Or for my Diamond the Chaine you promis'd,
1253   And Ile be gone sir, and not trouble you.
1254  *<S {S.Dro}.> Some diuels aske but the parings of ones naile,
      <P H6><C B>
1255  *a rush, a haire, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, a  cherrie-stone:
1256  *but she more couetous, wold haue a chaine: Ma-ster
1257  *be wise, #and if you giue it her, the diuell will shake
1258   her Chaine, and fright vs with it.
1259   <S {Cur}.> I pray you sir my Ring, or else the Chaine,
1260   I hope you do not meane to cheate me so?
1261   <S {Ant}.> Auant thou witch: Come {Dromio} let vs go.
1262  *<S {S.Dro}.> Flie pride saies the Pea- cocke, Mistris that
1263   you know.  <D {Exit}.>
1264   <S {Cur}.> Now out of doubt {Antipholus} is mad,
1265   Else would he neuer so demeane himselfe,
1266   A Ring he hath of mine worth fortie Duckets,
1267   And for the same he promis'd me a Chaine,
1268   Both one and other he denies me now:
1269   The reason that I gather he is mad,
1270   Besides this present instance of his rage,
1271   Is a mad tale he told to day at dinner,
1272   Of his owne doores being shut against his entrance.
1273   Belike his wife acquainted with his fits,
1274   On purpose shut the doores against his way:
1275   My way is now to hie home to his house,
1276   And tell his wife, that being Lunaticke,
1277   He rush'd into my house, and tooke perforce
1278   My Ring away. This course I fittest choose,
1279   For fortie Duckets is too much to loose.
1280   <D {Enter Antipholus Ephes. with a Iailor}.>
1281   <S {An}.> Feare me not man, I will not breake away,
1282   Ile giue thee ere I leaue thee so much money
1283   To warrant thee as I am rested for.
1284   My wife is in a wayward moode to day,
1285   And will not lightly trust the Messenger,
1286   That I should be attach'd in {Ephesus},
1287   I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her eares.
1288   <D {Enter Dromio Eph. with a ropes end}.>
1289   Heere comes my Man, I thinke he brings the monie.
1290   How now sir? Haue you that I sent you for?
1291   <S {E.Dro}.> Here's that I warrant you will pay them all.
1292   <S {Anti}.> But where's the Money?
1293   <S {E.Dro}.> Why sir, I gaue the Monie for the Rope.
1294   <S {Ant}.> Fiue hundred Duckets villaine for a rope?
1295   <S {E.Dro}.> Ile serue you sir fiue hundred at the rate.
1296   <S {Ant}.> To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
1297  *<S {E.Dro}.> To a ropes end sir, and to that end am I re-turn'd.
1298  _
1299   <S {Ant}.> And to that end sir, I will welcome you.
1300   <S {Offi}.> Good sir be patient.
1301  *<S {E.Dro}.> Nay 'tis for me to be patient, I am in aduer-sitie.
1302  _
1303   <S {Offi}.> Good now hold thy tongue.
1304  *<S {E.Dro}.> Nay, rather perswade him to hold his hands.
1305   <S {Anti}.> Thou whoreson senselesse Villaine.
1306  *<S {E.Dro}.> I would I were senselesse sir, that I might
1307   not feele your blowes.
1308  *<S {Anti}.> Thou art sensible in nothing but blowes, and
1309   so is an Asse.
1310  *<S {E.Dro}.> I am an Asse indeede, you may prooue it by
1311  *my long eares. I haue serued him from the houre of my
1312  *Natiuitie to this instant, and haue nothing at his hands
1313  *for my seruice but blowes. When I am cold, he heates
1314  *me with beating: when I am warme, he cooles me with
1315  *beating: I am wak'd with it when I sleepe, rais'd with
1316  *it when I sit, driuen out of doores with it when I goe
1317  *from home, welcom'd home with it when I returne, nay
1318  *I beare it on my shoulders, as a begger woont her brat:
1319  *and I thinke when he hath lam'd me, I shall begge with
1320   it from doore to doore.
1321   <D {Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtizan, and a Schoole-master},
1322   {call'd Pinch}.>
1323  *<S {Ant}.> Come goe along, my wife is comming yon-der.
1324  _
1325  *<S {E.Dro}.> Mistris {respice finem}, respect your end, or ra-ther
1326  *the prophesie like the Parrat, beware the ropes end.
1327   <S {Anti}.> Wilt thou still talke?  <D {Beats Dro}.>
1328  *<S {Curt}.> How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
1329   <S {Adri}.> His inciuility confirmes no lesse:
1330   Good Doctor {Pinch}, you are a Coniurer,
1331   Establish him in his true sence againe,
1332   And I will please you what you will demand.
1333   <S {Luc}.> Alas how fiery, and how sharpe he lookes.
1334   <S {Cur}.> Marke, how he trembles in his extasie.
1335  *<S {Pinch}.> Giue me your hand, and let mee feele your
1336   pulse.
1337   <S {Ant}.> There is my hand, and let it feele your eare.
1338  *<S {Pinch}.> I charge thee Sathan, hous'd within this man,
1339   To yeeld possession to my holie praiers,
1340   And to thy state of darknesse hie thee straight,
1341   I coniure thee by all the Saints in heauen.
1342   <S {Anti}.> Peace doting wizard, peace; I am not mad.
1343  *<S {Adr}.> Oh that thou wer't not, poore distressed soule.
1344  *<S {Anti}.> You Minion you, are these your Customers?
1345   Did this Companion with the saffron face
1346   Reuell and feast it at my house to day,
1347   Whil'st vpon me the guiltie doores were shut,
1348   And I denied to enter in my house.
1349  *<S {Adr}.> O husband, God doth know you din'd at home
1350   Where would you had remain'd vntill this time,
1351   Free from these slanders, and this open shame.
1352  *<S {Anti}.> Din'd at home? Thou Villaine, what sayest
1353   thou?
1354   <S {Dro}.> Sir sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
1355  *<S {Ant}.> Were not my doores lockt vp, and I shut out?
1356  *<S {Dro}.> Perdie, your doores were lockt, and you shut
1357   out.
1358   <S {Anti}.> And did not she her selfe reuile me there?
1359   <S {Dro}.> {Sans} Fable, she her selfe reuil'd you there.
1360  *<S {Anti}.> Did not her Kitchen maide raile, taunt, and
1361   scorne me?
1362   <S {Dro}.> {Certis} she did, the kitchin vestall scorn'd you.
1363   <S {Ant}.> And did not I in rage depart from thence?
1364  *<S {Dro}.> In veritie you did, my bones beares witnesse,
1365   That since haue felt the vigor of his rage.
1366   <S {Adr}.> Is't good to sooth him in these contraries?
1367   <S {Pinch}.> It is no shame, the fellow finds his vaine,
1368   And yeelding to him, humors well his frensie.
1369  *<S {Ant}.> Thou hast subborn'd the Goldsmith to arrest
1370   mee.
1371   <S {Adr}.> Alas, I sent you Monie to redeeme you,
1372   By {Dromio} heere, who came in #hast for it.
1373  *<S {Dro}.> Monie by me? Heart and good #will you might,
1374   But surely Master not a ragge of Monie.
1375  *<S {Ant}.> Wentst not thou to her for a purse of Duckets.
1376   <S {Adri}.> He came to me, and I deliuer'd it.
1377   <S {Luci}.> And I am witnesse with her that she did:
1378   <S {Dro}.> God and the Rope- maker beare me witnesse,
1379   That I was sent for nothing but a rope.
1380   <S {Pinch}.> Mistris, both Man and Master is possest,
1381   I know it by their pale and deadly lookes,
      <P H6v>
1382   They must be bound and laide in some darke roome.
1383  *<S {Ant}.> Say wherefore didst thou  locke me forth to day,
1384   And why dost thou denie the bagge of gold?
1385   <S {Adr}.> I did not gentle husband locke thee forth.
1386   <S {Dro}.> And gentle Mr I receiu'd no gold:
1387   But I confesse sir, that we were lock'd out.
1388  *<S {Adr}.> Dissembling Villain, thou speak'st false in both
1389   <S {Ant}.> Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
1390   And art confederate with a damned packe,
1391   To make a loathsome abiect scorne of me:
1392   But with these nailes, Ile plucke out these false eyes,
1393   That would behold in me this shamefull sport.
1394   <D {Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him}:
1395   {Hee striues}.>
1396  *<S {Adr}.> Oh binde him, binde him, let him not come
1397   neere me.
1398  *<S {Pinch}.> More company, the fiend is strong within him
1399  *<S {Luc}.> Aye me poore man, how pale and wan he looks.
1400  *<S {Ant}.> What will you murther me, thou Iailor thou?
1401  *I am thy prisoner, wilt thou suffer them to make a res-cue?
1402  _
1403  *<S {Offi}.> Masters let him go: he is my prisoner, and you
1404   shall not haue him.
1405   <S {Pinch}.> Go binde this man, for he is franticke too.
1406   <S {Adr}.> What wilt thou do, thou peeuish Officer?
1407   Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
1408   Do outrage and displeasure to himselfe?
1409   <S {Offi}.> He is my prisoner, if I let him go,
1410   The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
1411   <S {Adr}.> I will discharge thee ere I go from thee,
1412   Beare me forthwith vnto his Creditor,
1413   And knowing how the debt growes I will pay it.
1414   Good Master Doctor see him safe conuey'd
1415   Home to my house, oh most vnhappy day.
1416   <S {Ant}.> Oh most vnhappie strumpet.
1417   <S {Dro}.> Master, I am heere entred in bond for you.
1418  *<S {Ant}.> Out on thee Villaine, wherefore dost thou mad
1419   mee?
1420  *<S {Dro}.> Will you be bound for nothing, be mad good
1421   Master, cry the diuell.
1422  *<S {Luc}.> God helpe poore soules, how idlely doe they
1423   talke.
1424   <S {Adr}.> Go beare him hence, sister go you with me:
1425   Say now, whose suite is he arrested at?
1426   <D {Exeunt. Manet Offic. Adri. Luci. Courtizan}>
1427   <S {Off}.> One {Angelo} a Goldsmith, do you know him?
1428  *<S {Adr}.> I know the man: what is the summe he owes?
1429   <S {Off}.> Two hundred Duckets.
1430   <S {Adr}.> Say, how growes it due.
1431   <S {Off}.> Due for a Chaine your husband had of him.
1432  *<S {Adr}.> He did bespeake a Chain for me, but had it not.
1433   <S {Cur}.> When as your husband all in rage to day
1434   Came to my house, and tooke away my Ring,
1435   The Ring I saw vpon his finger now,
1436   Straight after did I meete him with a Chaine.
1437   <S {Adr}.> It may be so, but I did neuer see it.
1438   Come Iailor, bring me where the Goldsmith is,
1439   I long to know the truth heereof at large.
1440   <D {Enter Antipholus Siracusia with his Rapier drawne},
1441   {and Dromio Sirac}.>
1442   <S {Luc}.> God for thy mercy, they are loose againe.
1443   <S {Adr}.> And come with naked swords,
1444   Let's call more helpe to haue them bound againe.
1445   <D {Runne all out}.>
1446   <S {Off}.> Away, they'l kill vs.
1447   <D {Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted}.>
1448   <S {S.Ant}.> I see these Witches are affraid of swords.
1449  *<S {S.Dro}.> She that would be your wife, now ran from
1450   you.
1451  *<S {Ant}.> Come to the Centaur, fetch our stuffe from
1452   thence:
1453   I long that we were safe and sound aboord.
1454  *<S {Dro}.> Faith stay heere this night, they will surely do
1455  *vs no harme: you saw they speake vs faire, giue vs gold:
1456  *me thinkes they are such a gentle Nation, that but for
1457  *the Mountaine of mad flesh that claimes mariage of me,
1458  *I could finde in my heart to stay heere still, and turne
1459   Witch.
1460   <S {Ant}.> I will not stay to night for all the Towne,
1461   Therefore away, to get our stuffe aboord. <D {Exeunt}>
1462   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima}.>
1463   <D {Enter the Merchant and the Goldsmith}.>
1464   <S {Gold}.> I am sorry Sir that I haue hindred you,
1465   But I protest he had the Chaine of me,
1466   Though most dishonestly he doth denie it.
1467   <S {Mar}.> How is the man esteem'd heere in the Citie?
1468   <S {Gold}.> Of very reuerent reputation sir,
1469   Of credit infinite, highly belou'd,
1470   Second to none that liues heere in the Citie:
1471   His word might beare my wealth at any time.
1472  *<S {Mar}.> Speake  softly, yonder as I thinke he walkes.
1473   <D {Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe}.>
1474  *<S {Gold}.> 'Tis so: and that selfe chaine about his necke,
1475   Which he forswore most monstrously to haue.
1476   Good sir draw neere to me, Ile speake to him:
1477   Signior {Antipholus}, I wonder much
1478   That you would put me to this shame and trouble,
1479   And not without some scandall to your selfe,
1480   With circumstance and oaths, so to denie
1481   This Chaine, which now you weare so openly.
1482   Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
1483   You haue done wrong to this my honest friend,
1484   Who but for staying on our Controuersie,
1485   Had hoisted saile, and put to sea to day:
1486   This Chaine you had of me, can you deny it?
1487   <S {Ant}.> I thinke I had, I neuer did deny it.
1488   <S {Mar}.> Yes that you did sir, and forswore it too.
1489   <S {Ant}.> Who heard me to denie it or forsweare it?
1490  *<S {Mar}.> These eares of mine thou knowst did hear thee:
1491   Fie on thee wretch, 'tis pitty that thou liu'st
1492   To walke where any honest men resort.
1493   <S {Ant}.> Thou art a Villaine to impeach me thus,
1494   Ile proue mine honor, and mine honestie
1495   Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand:
1496   <S {Mar}.> I dare and do defie thee for a villaine.
1497  *<D {They draw. Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtezan, & others}.>
1498   <S {Adr}.> Hold, hurt him not for God sake, he is mad,
1499   Some get within him, take his sword away:
1500   Binde {Dromio} too, and beare them to my house.
1501  *<S {S.Dro}.> Runne master run, for Gods sake take a house,
1502   This is some Priorie, in, or we are spoyl'd.
1503   <D {Exeunt to the Priorie}.>
      <P I1>
1504   <D {Enter Ladie Abbesse}.>
1505   <S {Ab}.> Be quiet people, wherefore throng you hither?
1506   <S {Adr}.> To fetch my poore distracted husband hence,
1507   Let vs come in, that we may binde him fast,
1508   And beare him home for his recouerie.
1509   <S {Gold}.> I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
1510   <S {Mar}.> I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
1511   <S {Ab}.> How long hath this possession held the man.
1512   <S {Adr}.> This weeke he hath beene heauie, sower sad,
1513   And much different from the man he was:
1514   But till this afternoone his passion
1515   Ne're brake into extremity of rage.
1516  *<S {Ab}.> Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea,
1517   Buried some deere friend, hath not else his eye
1518   Stray'd his affection in vnlawfull loue,
1519   A sinne preuailing much in youthfull men,
1520   Who giue their eies the liberty of gazing.
1521   Which of these sorrowes is he subiect #too?
1522   <S {Adr}.> To none of these, except it be the last,
1523   Namely, some loue that drew him oft from home.
1524   <S {Ab}.> You should for that haue reprehended him.
1525   <S {Adr}.> Why so I did.
1526   <S {Ab}.> #I but not rough enough.
1527   <S {Adr}.> As roughly as my modestie would let me.
1528   <S {Ab}.> Haply in priuate.
1529   <S {Adr}.> And in assemblies too.
1530   <S {Ab}.> #I, but not enough.
1531   <S {Adr}.> It was the copie of our Conference.
1532   In bed he slept not for my vrging it,
1533   At boord he fed not for my vrging it:
1534   Alone, it was the subiect of my Theame:
1535   In company I often glanced it:
1536   Still did I tell him, it was vilde and bad.
1537   <S {Ab}.> And thereof came it, that the man was mad.
1538   The venome clamors of a iealous woman,
1539   Poisons more deadly then a mad dogges tooth.
1540   It seemes his sleepes were hindred by thy railing,
1541   And thereof comes it that his head is light.
1542   Thou saist his meate was sawc'd with thy vpbraidings,
1543   Vnquiet meales make #ill digestions,
1544   Thereof the raging fire of feauer bred,
1545   And what's a Feauer, but a fit of madnesse?
1546   Thou sayest his sports were hindred by thy bralles.
1547   Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
1548   But moodie and dull melancholly,
1549   Kinsman to grim and comfortlesse dispaire,
1550   And at her heeles a huge infectious troope
1551   Of  pale distemperatures, and foes to life?
1552   In food, in sport, and life- preseruing rest
1553   To be disturb'd, would mad or man, or beast:
1554   The consequence is then, thy iealous fits
1555   Hath scar'd thy husband from the vse of wits.
1556   <S {Luc}.> She neuer reprehended him but mildely,
1557   When he demean'd himselfe, rough, rude, and wildly,
1558   Why beare you these rebukes, and answer not?
1559   <S {Adri}.> She did betray me to my owne reproofe,
1560   Good people enter, and lay hold on him.
1561   <S {Ab}.> No, not a creature enters in my house.
1562  *<S {Ad}.> Then let your seruants bring my husband forth
1563   <S {Ab}.> Neither: he tooke this place for sanctuary,
1564   And it shall priuiledge him from your hands,
1565   Till I haue brought him to his wits againe,
1566   Or loose my labour in assaying it.
1567   <S {Adr}.> I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
1568   Diet his sicknesse, for it is my Office,
1569   And will haue no atturney but my selfe,
1570   And therefore let me haue him home with me.
1571   <S {Ab}.> Be patient, for I will not let him stirre,
1572   Till I haue vs'd the approoued meanes I haue,
1573   With wholsome sirrups, drugges, and holy prayers
1574   To make of him a formall man againe:
1575   It is a branch and parcell of mine oath,
1576   A charitable dutie of my order,
1577   Therefore depart, and leaue him heere with me.
1578  *<S {Adr}.> I will not hence, and leaue my husband heere:
1579   And #ill it doth beseeme your holinesse
1580   To separate the husband and the wife.
1581   <S {Ab}.> Be quiet and depart, thou shalt not haue him.
1582   <S {Luc}.> Complaine vnto the Duke of this indignity.
1583   <S {Adr}.> Come go, I will fall prostrate at his feete,
1584   And neuer rise vntill my teares and prayers
1585   Haue won his grace to come in person hither,
1586   And take perforce my husband from the Abbesse.
1587   <S {Mar}.> By this I thinke the Diall points at fiue:
1588   Anon I'me sure the Duke himselfe in person
1589   Comes this way to the melancholly vale;
1590   The place of depth, and sorrie execution,
1591   Behinde the ditches of the Abbey heere.
1592   <S {Gold}.> Vpon what cause?
1593   <S {Mar}.> To see a reuerent {Siracusian} Merchant,
1594   Who put vnluckily into this Bay
1595   Against the Lawes and Statutes of this Towne,
1596   Beheaded publikely for his offence.
1597  *<S {Gold}.> See where  they come, we wil behold his death
1598  *<S {Luc}.> Kneele to the Duke before he passe the Abbey.
1599   <D {Enter the Duke of Ephesus, and the Merchant of Siracuse}
1600   {bare head, with the Headsman, & other}
1601   {Officers}.>
1602   <S {Duke}.> Yet once againe proclaime it publikely,
1603   If any friend will pay the summe for him,
1604   He shall not die, so much we tender him.
1605  *<S {Adr}.> Iustice most sacred Duke against the Abbesse.
1606   <S {Duke}.> She is a vertuous and a reuerend Lady,
1607   It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
1608  *<S {Adr}.> May it please your Grace, {Antipholus} my husba[n]d,
1609   Who I made Lord of me, and all I had,
1610   At your important Letters this #ill day,
1611   A most outragious fit of madnesse tooke him:
1612   That desp'rately he hurried through the streete,
1613   With him his bondman, all as mad as he,
1614   Doing displeasure to the Citizens,
1615   By rushing in their houses: bearing thence
1616   Rings, Iewels, any thing his rage did like.
1617   Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,
1618   Whil'st to take order for the wrongs I went,
1619   That heere and there his furie had committed,
1620   Anon I wot not, by what strong escape
1621   He broke from those that had the guard of him,
1622   And with his mad attendant and himselfe,
1623   Each one with irefull passion, with drawne swords
1624   Met vs againe, and madly bent on vs
1625   Chac'd vs away: till raising of more aide
1626   We came againe to binde them: then they fled
1627   Into this Abbey, whether we pursu'd them,
1628   And heere the Abbesse shuts the gates on vs,
1629   And will not suffer vs to fetch him out,
1630   Nor send him forth, that we may beare him hence.
      <P I1v>
1631   Therefore most gracious Duke with thy command,
1632   Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for helpe.
1633  *<S {Duke}.> Long since thy husband seru'd me in my wars
1634   And I to thee ingag'd a Princes word,
1635   When thou didst make him Master of thy bed,
1636   To do him all the grace and good I could.
1637   Go some of you, knocke at the Abbey gate,
1638   And bid the Lady Abbesse come to me:
1639   I will determine this before I stirre.
1640   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1641   Oh Mistris, Mistris, shift and saue your selfe,
1642   My Master and his man are both broke loose,
1643   Beaten the Maids a- row, and bound the Doctor,
1644   Whose beard they haue sindg'd off with brands of fire,
1645   And euer as it blaz'd, they threw on him
1646   Great pailes of puddled myre to quench the haire;
1647   My Mr preaches patience to him, and the while
1648   His man with Cizers nickes him like a foole:
1649   And sure (vnlesse you send some present helpe)
1650   Betweene them they will kill the Coniurer.
1651  *<S {Adr}.> Peace foole, thy Master and his man are here,
1652   And that is false thou dost report to vs.
1653   <S {Mess}.> Mistris, vpon my life I tel you true,
1654   I haue not breath'd almost since I did see it.
1655   He cries for you, and vowes if he can take you,
1656   To scorch your face, and to disfigure you:
1657   <D {Cry within}.>
1658   Harke, harke, I heare him Mistris: flie, be gone.
1659  *<S {Duke}.> Come stand by me, feare nothing: guard with
1660   Halberds.
1661   <S {Adr}.> Ay me, it is my husband: witnesse you,
1662   That he is borne about inuisible,
1663   Euen now we hous'd him in the Abbey heere.
1664   And now he's there, past thought of humane reason.
1665   <D {Enter Antipholus, and E.#Dromio of Ephesus}.>
1666  *<S {E.Ant}.> Iustice most gracious Duke, oh grant me iu-|(stice,
1667   Euen for the seruice that long since I did thee,
1668   When I bestrid thee in the warres, and tooke
1669   Deepe scarres to saue thy life; euen for the blood
1670   That then I lost for thee, now grant me iustice.
1671  *<S {Mar.Fat}.> Vnlesse the feare of death doth make me
1672   dote, I see my sonne {Antipholus} and {Dromio}.
1673  *<S {E.Ant}.> Iustice (sweet Prince) against y Woman there:
1674   She whom thou gau'st to me to be my wife;
1675   That hath abused and dishonored me,
1676   Euen in the strength and height of iniurie:
1677   Beyond imagination is the wrong
1678   That she this day hath shamelesse throwne on me.
1679   <S {Duke}.> Discouer how, and thou shalt finde me iust.
1680  *<S {E.Ant}.> This day (great Duke) she shut the doores
1681   vpon me,
1682   While she with Harlots feasted in my house.
1683   <S {Duke}.> A greeuous fault: say woman, didst thou so?
1684  *<S {Adr}.> No my good Lord. My selfe, he, and my sister,
1685   To day did dine together: so befall my soule,
1686   As this is false he burthens me withall.
1687   <S {Luc}.> Nere may I looke on day, nor sleepe on night,
1688   But she tels to your Highnesse simple truth.
1689  *<S {Gold}.> O periur'd woman! They are both forsworne,
1690   In this the Madman iustly chargeth them.
1691   <S {E.Ant}.> My Liege, I am aduised what I say,
1692   Neither disturbed with the effect of Wine,
1693   Nor headie- rash prouoak'd with raging ire,
1694   Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
1695   This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
1696   That Goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
1697   Could witnesse it: for he was with me then,
1698   Who parted with me to go fetch a Chaine,
1699   Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
1700   Where {Balthasar} and I did dine together.
1701   Our dinner done, and he not comming thither,
1702   I went to seeke him. In the street I met him,
1703   And in his companie that Gentleman.
1704   There did this periur'd Goldsmith sweare me downe,
1705   That I this day of him receiu'd the Chaine,
1706   Which God he knowes, I saw not. For the which,
1707   He did arrest me with an Officer.
1708   I did obey, and sent my Pesant home
1709   For certaine Duckets: he with none return'd.
1710   Then fairely I bespoke the Officer
1711   To go in person with me to my house.
1712  *By'th' way, we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
1713   Of vilde Confederates: Along with them
1714  *They brought one {Pinch}, a hungry leane- fac'd Villaine;
1715   A meere Anatomie, a Mountebanke,
1716   A thred- bare Iugler, and a Fortune- teller,
1717   A needy- hollow- ey'd- sharpe- looking- wretch;
1718   A liuing dead man. This pernicious slaue,
1719   Forsooth tooke on him as a Coniurer:
1720   And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
1721   And with no- face (as 'twere) out- facing me,
1722   Cries out, I was possest. Then altogether
1723   They fell vpon me, bound me, bore me thence,
1724   And in a darke and dankish vault at home
1725   There left me and my man, both bound together,
1726   Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
1727   I gain'd my freedome; and immediately
1728   Ran hether to your Grace, whom I beseech
1729   To giue me ample satisfaction
1730   For these deepe shames, and great indignities.
1731  *<S {Gold}.> My Lord, in truth, thus far I witnes with him:
1732   That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
1733   <S {Duke}.> But had he such a Chaine of thee, or no?
1734   <S {Gold}.> He had my Lord, and when he ran in heere,
1735   These people saw the Chaine about his necke.
1736  *<S {Mar}.> Besides, I will be sworne these eares of mine,
1737   Heard you confesse you had the Chaine of him,
1738   After you first forswore it on the Mart,
1739   And thereupon I drew my sword on you:
1740   And then you fled into this Abbey heere,
1741   From whence I thinke you are come by Miracle.
1742   <S {E.Ant}.> I neuer came within these Abbey wals,
1743   Nor euer didst thou draw thy sword on me:
1744   I neuer saw the Chaine, so helpe me heauen:
1745   And this is false you burthen me withall.
1746   <S {Duke}.> Why what an intricate impeach is this?
1747   I thinke you all haue drunke of {Circes} cup:
1748   If heere you hous'd him, heere he would haue bin.
1749   If he were mad, he would not pleade so coldly:
1750   You say he din'd at home, the Goldsmith heere
1751   Denies that saying. Sirra, what say you?
1752  *<S {E.Dro}.> Sir he din'de with her there, at the Porpen-tine.
1753  _
1754   <S {Cur}.> He did, and from my finger snacht that Ring.
1755   <S {E.Anti}.> Tis true (my Liege) this Ring I had of her.
1756   <S {Duke}.> Saw'st thou him enter at the Abbey heere?
1757   <S {Curt}.> As sure (my Liege) as I do see your Grace.
1758  *<S {Duke}.> Why this is straunge: Go call the Abbesse hi-ther.
1759  _
1760   I thinke you are all mated, or starke mad.
      <P I2>
1761   <D {Exit one to the Abbesse}.>
1762  *<S {Fa}.> Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
1763   Haply I see a friend will saue my life,
1764   And pay the sum that may deliuer me.
1765   <S {Duke}.> Speake freely {Siracusian} what thou wilt.
1766   <S {Fath}.> Is not your name sir call'd {Antipholus}?
1767   And is not that your bondman {Dromio}?
1768   <S {E.Dro}.> Within this houre I was his bondman sir,
1769   But he I thanke him gnaw'd in two my cords,
1770   Now am I {Dromio}, and his man, vnbound.
1771   <S {Fath}.> I am sure you both of you remember me.
1772   <S {Dro}.> Our selues we do remember sir by you:
1773   For lately we were bound as you are now.
1774   You are not {Pinches} patient, are you sir?
1775  *<S {Father}.> Why looke you strange on me? you know
1776   me well.
1777   <S {E.Ant}.> I neuer saw you in my life till now.
1778  *<S {Fa}.> Oh! griefe hath chang'd me since you saw me last,
1779   And carefull houres with times deformed hand,
1780   Haue written strange defeatures in my face:
1781   But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
1782   <S {Ant}.> Neither.
1783   <S {Fat}.> {Dromio}, nor thou?
1784   <S {Dro}.> No trust me sir, nor I.
1785   <S {Fa}.> I am sure thou dost?
1786  *<S {E.Dromio}.> #I sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatso-euer
1787   a man denies, you are now bound to beleeue him.
1788   <S {Fath}.> Not know my voice, oh times extremity
1789   Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poore tongue
1790   In seuen short yeares, that heere my onely sonne
1791   Knowes not my feeble key of vntun'd cares?
1792   Though now this grained face of mine be hid
1793   In sap- consuming Winters drizled snow,
1794   And all the Conduits of my blood froze vp:
1795   Yet hath my night of life some memorie:
1796   My wasting lampes some fading glimmer left;
1797   My dull deafe eares a little vse to heare:
1798   All these old witnesses, I cannot erre.
1799   Tell me, thou art my sonne {Antipholus}.
1800   <S {Ant}.> I neuer saw my Father in my life.
1801   <S {Fa}.> But seuen yeares since, in {Siracusa} boy
1802   Thou know'st we parted, but perhaps my sonne,
1803   Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in miserie.
1804   <S {Ant}.> The Duke, and all that know me in the City,
1805   Can witnesse with me that it is not so.
1806   I ne're saw {Siracusa} in my life.
1807   <S {Duke}.> I tell thee {Siracusian}, twentie yeares
1808   Haue I bin Patron to {Antipholus},
1809   During which time, he ne're saw {Siracusa}:
1810   I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
1811   <D {Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus Siracusa},
1812   {and Dromio #Sir}.>
1813  *<S {Abbesse}.> Most mightie Duke, behold a man much
1814   wrong'd.
1815   <D {All gather to see them}.>
1816   <S {Adr}.> I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceiue me.
1817   <S {Duke}.> One of these men is {genius} to the other:
1818   And so of these, which is the naturall man,
1819   And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
1820   <S {S.Dromio}.> I Sir am {Dromio}, command him away.
1821   <S {E.Dro}.> I Sir am {Dromio}, pray let me stay.
1822   <S {S.Ant}.> {Egeon} art thou not? or else his ghost.
1823  *<S {S.Drom}.> Oh my olde Master, who hath bound him
1824   heere?
1825   <S {Abb}.> Who euer bound him, I will lose his bonds,
1826   And gaine a husband by his libertie:
1827   Speake olde {Egeon}, if thou bee'st the man
1828   That hadst a wife once call'd {Aemilia},
1829   That bore thee at a burthen two faire sonnes?
1830   Oh if thou bee'st the same {Egeon}, speake:
1831   And speake vnto the same {Aemilia}.
1832   <S {Duke}.> Why heere begins his Morning storie right:
1833   These two {Antipholus}, these two so like,
1834   And these two {Dromio's}, one in semblance:
1835   Besides her vrging of her wracke at sea,
1836   These are the parents to these children,
1837   Which accidentally are met together.
1838   <S {Fa}.> If I dreame not, thou art {Aemilia},
1839   If thou art she, tell me, where is that sonne
1840   That floated with thee on the fatall rafte.
1841   <S {Abb}.> By men of {Epidamium}, he, and I,
1842   And the twin {Dromio}, all were taken vp;
1843   But #by and by, rude Fishermen of {Corinth}
1844   By force tooke {Dromio}, and my sonne from them,
1845   And me they left with those of {Epidamium}.
1846   What then became of them, I cannot tell:
1847   I, to this fortune that you see mee in.
1848   <S {Duke}.> {Antipholus} thou cam'st from {Corinth} first.
1849   <S {S.Ant}.> No sir, not I, I came from {Siracuse}.
1850  *<S {Duke}.> Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.
1851  *<S {E.Ant}.> I came from {Corinth} my most gracious Lord
1852   <S {E.Dro}.> And I with him.
1853  *<S {E.Ant}.> Brought to this Town by that most famous
1854   Warriour,
1855   Duke {Menaphon} your most renowned Vnckle.
1856   <S {Adr}.> Which of you two did dine with me to day?
1857   <S {S.Ant}.> I, gentle Mistris.
1858   <S {Adr}.> And are not you my husband?
1859   <S {E.Ant}.> No, I say nay to that.
1860   <S {S.Ant}.> And so do I, yet did she call me so:
1861   And this faire Gentlewoman her sister heere
1862   Did call me brother. What I told you then,
1863   I hope I shall haue leisure to make good,
1864   If this be not a dreame I see and heare.
1865  *<S {Goldsmith}.> That is the Chaine sir, which you had of
1866   mee.
1867   <S {S.Ant}.> I thinke it be sir, I denie it not.
1868   <S {E.Ant}.> And you sir for this Chaine arrested me.
1869   <S {Gold}.> I thinke I did sir, I deny it not.
1870   <S {Adr}.> I sent you monie sir to be your baile
1871   By {Dromio}, but I thinke he brought it not.
1872   <S {E.Dro}.> No, none by me.
1873   <S {S.Ant}.> This purse of Duckets I receiu'd from you,
1874   And {Dromio} my man did bring them me:
1875   I see we still did meete each others man,
1876   And I was tane for him, and he for me,
1877   And thereupon these errors are arose.
1878  *<S {E.Ant}.> These Duckets pawne I for my father heere.
1879   <S {Duke}.> It shall not neede, thy father hath his life.
1880   <S {Cur}.> Sir I must haue that Diamond from you.
1881  *<S {E.Ant}.> There take it, and much thanks for my good
1882   cheere.
1883  *<S {Abb}.> Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the paines
1884   To go with vs into the Abbey heere,
1885   And heare at large discoursed all our fortunes,
1886   And all that are assembled in this place:
1887   That by this simpathized one daies error
1888   Haue suffer'd wrong. Goe, keepe vs companie,
      <P I2v>
1889   And we shall make full satisfaction.
1890   Thirtie three yeares haue I but gone in trauaile
1891   Of you my sonnes, and till this present houre
1892   My heauie burthen are deliuered:
1893   The Duke my husband, and my children both,
1894   And you the Kalenders of their Natiuity,
1895   Go to a Gossips feast, and go with mee,
1896   After so long greefe such Natiuitie.
1897   <S {Duke}.> With all my heart, Ile Gossip at this feast.
1898   <D {Exeunt omnes. Manet the two Dromio's and}
1899   {two Brothers}.>
1900  *<S {S.Dro}.> Mast[er]. shall I fetch your stuffe from shipbord?
1901  *<S {E.An}.> {Dromio}, what stuffe of mine hast thou imbarkt
1902  *<S {S.Dro}.> Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur.
1903  *<S {S.Ant}.> He speakes to me, I am your master {Dromio}.
1904   Come go with vs, wee'l looke to that anon,
1905   Embrace thy brother there, reioyce with him.  <D {Exit}>
1906   <S {S.Dro}.> There is a fat friend at your masters house,
1907   That kitchin'd me for you to day at dinner:
1908   She now shall be my sister, not my wife,
1909  *<S {E.D}.> Me thinks you are my glasse, & not my brother:
1910   I see by you, I am a sweet- fac'd youth,
1911   Will you walke in to see their gossipping?
1912   <S {S.Dro}.> Not I sir, you are my elder.
1913   <S {E.Dro}.> That's a question, how shall we trie it.
1914  *<S {S.Dro}.> Wee'l draw Cuts for the Signior, till then,
1915   lead thou first.
1916   <S {E.Dro}.> Nay then thus:
1917   We came into the world like brother and brother:
1918  *And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
1919   <D {Exeunt}.>
1920   <Z FINIS.
