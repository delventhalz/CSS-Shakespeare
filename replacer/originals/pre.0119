1      To the Reader.
2      This Figure, that thou here seest put,
3      It was for gentle Shakespeare cut;
4      Wherein the Grauer had a strife
5      with Nature, to out- doo the life:
6      O, could he but haue drawne his wit
7      As well in brasse, as he hath hit
8      His face; the Print would then surpasse
9      All, that was euer writ in brasse.
10     But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
11     Not on his Picture, but his Booke.

34     Right Honourable,
35    *{Whilst we studie to be thankful in our particular, for}
36    *{the many fauors we haue receiued from your L.L}
37    *{we are falne vpon the #ill fortune, to mingle}
38    *{two the most diuerse things that that can bee, feare},
39    *{and rashnesse; rashnesse in the enterprize, and}
40    *{feare of the successe. For, when we valew the places your H.H}.
41    *{sustaine, we cannot but know their dignity greater, then to descend to}
42    *{the reading of these trifles: and, while we name them trifles, we haue}
43    *{depriu'd our selues of the defence of our Dedication. But since your}
44    *{L.L. haue beene pleas'd to thinke these trifles some- thing, heereto-fore};
45    *{and haue prosequuted both them, and their Authour liuing},
46    *{with so much fauour: we hope, that (they out- liuing him, and he not}
47    *{hauing the fate, common with some, to be exequutor to his owne wri-tings)}
48    *{you will vse the like indulgence toward them, you haue done}
      <P pA2v>
49    *{vnto their parent. There is a great difference, whether any Booke}
50    *{choose his Patrones, or finde them: This hath done both. For},
51    *{so much were your L.L. likings of the seuerall parts, when}
52    *{they were acted, as before they were published, the Volume ask'd to}
53    *{be yours. We haue but collected them, and done an office to the}
54    *{dead, to procure his Orphanes, Guardians; without ambition ei-ther}
55    *{of selfe- profit, or fame: onely to keepe the memory of so worthy}
56    *{a Friend, & Fellow aliue, as was our} SHAKESPEARE, {by hum-ble}
57    *{offer of his playes, to your most noble patronage. Wherein, as}
58    *{we haue iustly obserued, no man to come neere your L.L. but with}
59    *{a kind of religious addresse; it hath bin the height of our care, who}
60    *{are the Presenters, to make the present worthy of your H.H. by the}
61    *{perfection. But, there we must also craue our abilities to be considerd},
62    *{my Lords. We cannot go beyond our owne powers. Country hands}
63    *{reach foorth milke, creame, fruites, or what they haue: and many}
64    *{Nations (we haue heard) that had not gummes & incense, obtai-ned}
65    *{their requests with a leauened Cake. It was no fault to approch}
66    *{their Gods, by what meanes they could: And the most, though}
67    *{meanest, of things are made more precious, when they are dedicated}
68    *{to Temples. In that name therefore, we most humbly consecrate to}
69    *{your H.H. these remaines of your seruant} Shakespeare; {that}
70    *{what delight is in them, may be euer your L.L. the reputation}

76     {To the great Variety of Readers}.
77    *From the most able, to him that can but spell: There
78    *you are number'd. We had rather you were weighd.
79    *Especially, when the fate of all Bookes depends vp-on
80    *your capacities: and not of your heads alone,
81    *but of your purses. Well! It is now publique, & you
82    *wil stand for your priuiledges wee know: to read,
83    *and censure. Do so, but buy it first. That doth best
84    *commend a Booke, the Stationer saies. Then, how odde soeuer your
85    *braines be, or your wisedomes, make your licence the same, and spare
86    *not. Iudge your sixe- pen'orth, your shillings worth, your fiue shil-lings
87    *worth at a time, or higher, so you rise to the iust rates, and wel-come.
88    *But, what euer you do, Buy. Censure will not driue a Trade,
89    *or make the Iacke go. And though you be a Magistrate of wit, and sit
90    *on the Stage at {Black- Friers}, or the {Cock- pit}, to arraigne Playes dailie,
91    *know, these Playes haue had their triall alreadie, and stood out all Ap-peales;
92    *and do now come forth quitted rather by a Decree of Court,
93     then any purchas'd Letters of commendation.
94    *It had bene a thing, we confesse, worthie to haue bene wished, that
95    *the Author himselfe had liu'd to haue set forth, and ouerseen his owne
96    *writings; But since it hath bin ordain'd otherwise, and he by death de-parted
97    *from that right, we pray you do not envie his Friends, the office
98    *of their care, and paine, to haue collected & publish'd them; and so to
99    *haue publish'd them, as where (before) you were abus'd with diuerse
100   *stolne, and surreptitious copies, maimed, and deformed by the frauds
101   *and stealthes of iniurious impostors, that expos'd them: euen those,
102   *are now offer'd to your view cur'd, and perfect of their limbes; and all
103   *the rest, absolute in their numbers, as he conceiued the[m]. Who, as he was
104   *a happie imitator of Nature, was a most gentle expresser of it. His mind
105   *and hand went together: And what he thought, he vttered with that
106   *easinesse, that wee haue scarse receiued from him a blot in his papers.
107   *But it is not our prouince, who onely gather his works, and giue them
108   *you, to praise him. It is yours that reade him. And there we hope, to
109   *your diuers capacities, you will finde enough, both to draw, and hold
110   *you: for his wit can no more lie hid, then it could be lost. Reade him,
111   *therefore; and againe, and againe: And if then you doe not like him,
112   *surely you are in some manifest danger, not to vnderstand him. And so
113   *we leaue you to other of his Friends, whom if you need, can bee your
114   *guides: if you neede them not, you can leade your selues, and others.
115    And such Readers we wish him.

118   *To the memory of my beloued,
119    The AVTHOR
120    MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE:
121    AND
122    what he hath left vs.
123    {To draw no enuy} (Shakespeare) {on thy name},
124    {Am I thus ample to thy Booke, and Fame}:
125    {While I confesse thy writings to be such},
126    {As neither} Man, {nor} Muse, {can praise too much}.
127    {'Tis true, and all mens suffrage. But these wayes}
128    {Were not the paths I meant vnto thy praise}:
129    {For seeliest Ignorance on these may light},
130    {Which, when it sounds at best, but eccho's right};
131    {Or blinde Affection, which doth ne're aduance}
132    {The truth, but gropes, and vrgeth all by chance};
133    {Or crafty Malice, might pretend this praise},
134    {And thinke to ruine, where it seem'd to raise}.
135    {These are, as some infamous Baud, or Whore},
136    {Should praise a Matron. What could hurt her more}?
137    {But thou art proofe against them, and indeed}
138    {Aboue the #ill fortune of them, or the need}.
139    {I, therefore will begin. Soule of the Age}!
140    {The applause! delight! the wonder of our Stage}!
141    {My} Shakespeare, {rise; I will not lodge thee by}
142    Chaucer, {or} Spenser, {or bid} Beaumont {lye}
143    {A little further, to make thee a roome}:
144    {Thou art a Moniment, without a tombe},
145    {And art aliue still, while thy Booke doth liue},
146    {And we haue wits to read, and praise to giue}.
147    {That I not mixe thee so, my braine excuses};
148    {I meane with great, but disproportion'd} Muses:
149    {For, if I thought my iudgement were of yeeres},
150    {I should commit thee surely with thy peeres},
151    {And tell, how farre thou didst our} Lily {out- shine},
152    {Or sporting} Kid, {or} Marlowes {mighty line}.
153    {And though thou hadst small} Latine, {and lesse} Greeke,
154    {From thence to honour thee, I would not seeke}
155    {For names; but call forth thund'ring} Aeschilus,
156    Euripides, {and} Sophocles {to vs},
157    Paccuuius, Accius, {him of} Cordoua {dead},
158    {To life againe, to heare thy Buskin tread},
159    {And shake a Stage: Or, when thy Sockes were on},
160    {Leaue thee alone, for the comparison}
      <P pA4v>
161    {Of all, that insolent} Greece, {or haughtie} Rome
162    {sent forth, or since did from their ashes come}.
163    {Triumph, my} Britaine, {thou hast one to showe},
164    {To whom all Scenes of} Europe {homage owe}.
165    {He was not of an age, but for all time}!
166    {And all the} Muses {still were in their prime},
167    {When like} Apollo {he came forth to warme}
168    {Our eares, or like a} Mercury {to charme}!
169    {Nature herselfe was proud of his designes},
170    {And ioy'd to weare the dressing of his lines}!
171    {Which were so richly spun, and wouen so fit},
172    {As, since, she will vouchsafe no other Wit}.
173    {The merry} Greeke, {tart} Aristophanes,
174    {Neat} Terence, {witty} Plautus, {now not please};
175    {But antiquated, and deserted lye}
176    {As they were not of Natures family}.
177    {Yet must I not giue Nature all: Thy #Art},
178    {My gentle} Shakespeare, {must enioy a part}.
179    {For though the} Poets {matter, Nature be},
180    {His #Art doth giue the fashion. And, that he},
181    {Who casts to write a liuing line, must sweat},
182    ({such as thine are) and strike the second heat}
183    {Vpon the} Muses {anuile: turne the same},
184    ({And himselfe with it) that he thinkes to frame};
185    {Or for the lawrell, he may gaine a scorne},
186    {For a good} Poet's {made, as well as borne}.
187    {And such wert thou. Looke how the fathers face}
188    {Liues in his issue, euen so, the race}
189    {Of} Shakespeares {minde, and manners brightly shines}
190    {In his well torned, and true- filed lines}:
191    {In each of which, he seemes to shake a Lance},
192    {As brandish't at the eyes of Ignorance}.
193    {Sweet Swan of} Auon! {what a sight it were}
194    {To see thee in our waters yet appeare},
195    {And make those flights vpon the bankes of} Thames,
196    {That so did take} Eliza, {and our} Iames!
197    {But stay, I see thee in the} Hemisphere
198    {Aduanc'd, and made a Constellation there}!
199    {Shine forth, thou Starre of} Poets, {and with rage},
200    {Or influence, chide, or cheere the drooping Stage};
201    {Which, since thy flight fro[m] hence, hath mourn'd like night},
202    {And despaires day, but for thy Volumes  light}.

204   *Vpon the Lines and Life of the Famous
205    Scenicke Poet, Master WILLIAM
206    SHAKESPEARE.
207    Those hands, which you so clapt, go now, and wring
208    You {Britaines} braue; for done are {Shakespeares} dayes;
209    His dayes are done, that made the dainty Playes,
210    Which made the Globe of heau'n and earth to ring.
211    Dry'de is that veine, dry'd is the {Thespian} Spring,
212    Turn'd all to teares, and {Phoebus} clouds his rayes:
213    That corp's, that coffin now besticke those bayes,
214    Which crown'd him {Poet} first, then {Poets} King.
215    If {Tragedies} might any {Prologue} haue,
216    All those he made, would scarse make one to this:
217    Where {Fame}, now that he gone is to the graue
218    (Deaths publique tyring- house) the {Nuncius} is.
219    For though his line of life went soone about,
220    The life yet of his lines shall neuer out.
