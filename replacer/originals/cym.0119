1      <Z {Actus  Primus. Scoena Prima}.>
2      <D {Enter two Gentlemen}.>
3      <S 1.{Gent}.>
4      You do not meet a man but Frownes.
5      Our bloods no more obey the Heauens
6      Then our Courtiers:
7      Still seeme, as do's the Kings.
8      <S 2 {Gent}.> But what's the matter?
9     *<S 1.> His daughter, and the heire of's kingdome (whom
10     He purpos'd to his wiues sole Sonne, a Widdow
11     That late he married) hath referr'd her selfe
12     Vnto a poore, but worthy Gentleman. She's wedded,
13     Her Husband banish'd; she imprison'd, all
14     Is outward sorrow, though I thinke the King
15     Be touch'd at very heart.
16     <S 2> None but the King?
17     <S 1> He that hath lost her too: so is the Queene,
18     That most desir'd the Match. But not a Courtier,
19     Although they weare their faces to the bent
20     Of the Kings lookes, hath a heart that is not
21     Glad at the thing they scowle at.
22     <S 2> And why so?
23     <S 1> He that hath miss'd the Princesse, is a thing
24     Too bad, for bad report: and he that hath her,
25     (I meane, that married her, alacke good man,
26     And therefore banish'd) is a Creature, such,
27     As to seeke through the Regions of the Earth
28     For one, his like; there would be something failing
29     In him, that should compare. I do not thinke,
30     So faire an Outward, and such stuffe Within
31     Endowes a man, but hee.
32     <S 2> You speake him farre.
33     <S 1> I do extend him (Sir) within himselfe,
34     Crush him together, rather then vnfold
35     His measure duly.
36     <S 2> What's his name, and Birth?
37     <S 1> I cannot delue him to the roote: His Father
38     Was call'd {Sicillius}, who did ioyne his Honor
39     Against the Romanes, with {Cassibulan},
40     But had his Titles by {Tenantius}, whom
41     He seru'd with Glory, and admir'd Successe:
42     So gain'd the Sur- addition, {Leonatus}.
43     And had (besides this Gentleman in question)
44     Two other Sonnes, who in the Warres o'th' time
45    *Dy'de with their Swords in hand. For which, their Father
46     Then old, and fond of yssue, tooke such sorrow
47     That he quit Being; and his gentle Lady
48     Bigge of this Gentleman (our Theame) deceast
49     As he was borne. The King he takes the Babe
50     To his protection, cals him {Posthumus Leonatus},
51     Breedes him, and makes him of his Bed- chamber,
52     Puts to him all the Learnings that his time
53     Could make him the receiuer of, which he tooke
54     As we do ayre, fast as 'twas ministred,
55     And in's Spring, became a Haruest: Liu'd in Court
56     (Which rare it is to do) most prais'd, most lou'd,
57     A sample to the yongest: to th' more Mature,
58     A glasse that feated them: and to the grauer,
59     A Childe that guided Dotards. To his Mistris,
60     (For whom he now is banish'd) her owne price
61     Proclaimes how she esteem'd him; and his Vertue
62    *By her electio[n] may be truly read, what kind of man he is.
63     <S 2> I honor him, euen out of your report.
64     But pray you tell me, is she sole childe to'th' King?
65     <S 1> His onely childe:
66     He had two Sonnes (if this be worth your hearing,
67     Marke it) the eldest of them, at three yeares old
68     I'th' swathing cloathes, the other from their Nursery
69    *Were stolne, and to this houre, no ghesse in knowledge
70     Which way they went.
71     <S 2> How long is this ago?
72     <S 1> Some twenty yeares.
73     <S 2> That a Kings Children should be so conuey'd,
74     So slackely guarded, and the search so slow
75     That could not trace them.
76     <S 1> Howsoere, 'tis strange,
77     Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at:
78     Yet is it true Sir.
79     <S 2> I do well beleeue you.
80     <S 1> We must forbeare. Heere comes the Gentleman,
81     The Queene, and Princesse.  <D {Exeunt}>
82     <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
83     <D {Enter the Queene, Posthumus, and Imogen}.>
84    *<S {Qu}.> No, be assur'd you shall not finde me (Daughter)
85     After the slander of most Step- Mothers,
86     Euill- ey'd vnto you. You're my Prisoner, but
87     Your Gaoler shall deliuer you the keyes
      <P zz3v>
88     That locke vp your restraint. For you {Posthumus},
89     So soone as I can win th' offended King,
90     I will be knowne your Aduocate: marry yet
91     The fire of Rage is in him, and 'twere good
92     You lean'd vnto his Sentence, with what patience
93     Your wisedome may informe you.
94     <S {Post}.> 'Please your Highnesse,
95     I will from hence to day.
96     <S {Qu}.> You know the perill:
97     Ile fetch a turne about the Garden, pittying
98     The pangs of barr'd Affections, though the King
99     Hath charg'd you should not speake together.  <D {Exit}>
100    <S {Imo}.> O dissembling Curtesie! How fine this Tyrant
101    Can tickle where she wounds? My deerest Husband,
102    I something feare my Fathers wrath, but nothing
103    (Alwayes reseru'd my holy duty) what
104    His rage can do on me. You must be gone,
105    And I shall heere abide the hourely shot
106    Of angry eyes: not comforted to liue,
107    But that there is this Iewell in the world,
108    That I may see againe.
109    <S {Post}.> My Queene, my Mistris:
110    O Lady, weepe no more, least I giue cause
111    To be suspected of more tendernesse
112    Then doth become a man. I will remaine
113    The loyall'st husband, that did ere plight troth.
114    My residence in Rome, at one {Filorio's},
115    Who, to my Father was a Friend, to me
116    Knowne but by Letter; thither write (my Queene)
117    And with mine eyes, Ile drinke the words you send,
118    Though Inke be made of Gall.
119    <D {Enter Queene}.>
120    <S {Qu}.> Be briefe, I pray you:
121    If the King come, I shall incurre, I know not
122    How much of his displeasure: yet Ile moue him
123    To walke this way: I neuer do him wrong,
124    But he do's buy my Iniuries, to be Friends:
125    Payes deere for my offences.
126    <S {Post}.> Should we be taking leaue
127    As long a terme as yet we haue to liue,
128    The loathnesse to depart, would grow: Adieu.
129    <S {Imo}.> Nay, stay a little:
130    Were you but riding forth to ayre your selfe,
131    Such parting were too petty. Looke heere (Loue)
132    This Diamond was my Mothers; take it (Heart)
133    But keepe it till you woo another Wife,
134    When {Imogen} is dead.
135    <S {Post}.> How, how? Another?
136    You gentle Gods, giue me but this I haue,
137    And seare vp my embracements from a next,
138    With bonds of death. Remaine, remaine thou heere,
139    While sense can keepe it on: And sweetest, fairest,
140    As I (my poore selfe) did exchange for you
141    To your so infinite losse; so in our trifles
142    I still winne of you. For my sake weare this,
143    It is a Manacle of Loue, Ile place it
144    Vpon this fayrest Prisoner.
145    <S {Imo}.> O the Gods!
146    When shall we see againe?
147    <D {Enter Cymbeline, and Lords}.>
148    <S {Post}.> Alacke, the King.
149   *<S {Cym}.> Thou basest thing, auoyd hence, from my sight:
150    If after this command thou fraught the Court
151    With thy vnworthinesse, thou dyest. Away,
152    Thou'rt poyson to my blood.
153    <S {Post}.> The Gods protect you,
154    And blesse the good Remainders of the Court:
155    I am gone.
156    <S {Imo}.> There cannot be a pinch in death
157    More sharpe then this is.
158    <S {Cym}.> O disloyall thing,
159    That should'st repayre my youth, thou heap'st
160    A yeares age on mee.
161    <S {Imo}.> I beseech you Sir,
162    Harme not your selfe with your vexation,
163    I am senselesse of your Wrath; a Touch more rare
164    Subdues all pangs, all feares.
165    <S {Cym}.> Past Grace? Obedience?
166    <S {Imo}.> Past hope, and in dispaire, that way past Grace.
167    <S {Cym}.> That might'st haue had
168    The sole Sonne of my Queene.
169    <S {Imo}.> O blessed, that I might not: I chose an Eagle,
170    And did auoyd a Puttocke.
171   *<S {Cym}.> Thou took'st a Begger, would'st haue made my
172    Throne, a Seate for basenesse.
173    <S {Imo}.> No, I rather added a lustre to it.
174    <S {Cym}.> O thou vilde one!
175    <S {Imo}.> Sir,
176    It is your fault that I haue lou'd {Posthumus}:
177    You bred him as my Play- fellow, and he is
178    A man, worth any woman: Ouer- buyes mee
179    Almost the summe he payes.
180    <S {Cym}.> What? art thou mad?
181    <S {Imo}.> Almost Sir: Heauen restore me: would I were
182    A Neat- heards Daughter, and my {Leonatus}
183    Our Neighbour- Shepheards Sonne.
184    <D {Enter Queene}.>
185    <S {Cym}.> Thou foolish thing;
186    They were againe together: you haue done
187    Not after our command. Away with her,
188    And pen her vp.
189    <S {Qu}.> Beseech your patience: Peace
190    Deere Lady daughter, peace. Sweet Soueraigne,
191   *Leaue vs to our selues, and make your self some comfort
192    Out of your best aduice.
193    <S {Cym}.> Nay, let her languish
194    A drop of blood a day, and being aged
195    Dye of this Folly. <D {Exit}.>
196    <D {Enter Pisanio}.>
197    <S {Qu}.> Fye, you must giue way:
198    Heere is your Seruant. How now Sir? What newes?
199    <S {Pisa}.> My Lord your Sonne, drew on my Master.
200    <S {Qu}.> Hah?
201    No harme I trust is done?
202    <S {Pisa}.> There might haue beene,
203    But that my Master rather plaid, then fought,
204    And had no helpe of Anger: they were parted
205    By Gentlemen, at hand.
206    <S {Qu}.> I am very glad on't.
207   *<S {Imo}.> Your Son's my Fathers friend, he takes his part
208    To draw vpon an Exile. O braue Sir,
209    I would they were in Affricke both together,
210    My selfe by with a Needle, that I might pricke
211    The goer backe. Why came you from your Master?
212    <S {Pisa}.> On his command: he would not suffer mee
213    To bring him to the Hauen: left these Notes
214    Of what commands I should be subiect #too,
215    When't pleas'd you to employ me.
216    <S {Qu}.> This hath beene
217    Your faithfull Seruant: I dare lay mine Honour
218    He will remaine so.
219    <S {Pisa}.> I humbly thanke your Highnesse.
      <P zz4>
220    <S {Qu}.> Pray walke a- while.
221    <S {Imo}.> About some halfe houre hence,
222    Pray you speake with me;
223    You shall (at least) go see my Lord aboord.
224    For this time leaue me.  <D {Exeunt}.>
225    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
226    <D {Enter Clotten, and two Lords}.>
227   *<S 1.> Sir, I would aduise you to shift a Shirt; the Vio-lence
228   *of Action hath made you reek as a Sacrifice: where
229   *ayre comes out, ayre comes in: There's none abroad so
230    wholesome as that you vent.
231    <S {Clot}.> If my Shirt were bloody, then to shift it.
232    Haue I hurt him?
233    <S 2> No faith: not so much as his patience.
234   *<S 1> Hurt him? His bodie's a passable Carkasse if he bee
235    not hurt. It is a through- fare for Steele if it be not hurt.
236   *<S 2> His Steele was in debt, it went o'th' Backe- side the
237    Towne.
238    <S {Clot}.> The Villaine would not stand me.
239    <S 2> No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.
240   *<S 1> Stand you? you haue Land enough of your owne:
241    But he added to your #hauing, gaue you some ground.
242    <S 2> As many Inches, as you haue Oceans (Puppies.)
243    <S {Clot}.> I would they had not come betweene vs.
244   *<S 2> So would I, till you had measur'd how long a Foole
245    you were vpon the ground.
246   *<S {Clot}.> And that shee should loue this Fellow, and re-fuse
247    mee.
248   *<S 2> If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn'd.
249   *<S 1> Sir, as I told you alwayes: her Beauty & her Braine
250   *go not together. Shee's a good signe, but I haue seene
251    small reflection of her wit.
252    <S 2> She shines not vpon Fooles, least the reflection
253    Should hurt her.
254   *<S {Clot}.> Come, Ile to my Chamber: would there had
255    beene some hurt done.
256   *<S 2> I wish not so, vnlesse it had bin the fall of an Asse,
257    which is no great hurt.
258    <S {Clot}.> You'l go with vs?
259    <S 1> Ile attend your Lordship.
260    <S {Clot}.> Nay come, let's go together.
261    <S 2> Well my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
262    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
263    <D {Enter Imogen, and Pisanio}.>
264   *<S {Imo}.> I would thou grew'st vnto the shores o'th' Hauen,
265    And questioned'st euery Saile: if he should write,
266    And I not haue it, 'twere a Paper lost
267    As offer'd mercy is: What was the last
268    That he spake to thee?
269    <S {Pisa}.> It was his Queene, his Queene.
270    <S {Imo}.> Then wau'd his Handkerchiefe?
271    <S {Pisa}.> And kist it, Madam.
272    <S {Imo}.> Senselesse Linnen, happier therein then I:
273    And that was all?
274    <S {Pisa}.> No Madam: for so long
275    As he could make me with his eye, or eare,
276    Distinguish him from others, he did keepe
277    The Decke, with Gloue, or Hat, or Handkerchife,
278    Still wauing, as the fits and stirres of's mind
279    Could best expresse how slow his Soule sayl'd on,
280    How swift his Ship.
281    <S {Imo}.> Thou should'st haue made him
282    As little as a Crow, or lesse, ere left
283    To after- eye him.
284    <S {Pisa}.> Madam, so I did.
285    <S {Imo}.> I would haue broke mine eye- strings;
286   *Crack'd them, but to looke vpon him, till the diminution
287    Of space, had pointed him sharpe as my Needle:
288    Nay, followed him, till he had melted from
289    The smalnesse of a Gnat, to ayre: and then
290    Haue turn'd mine eye, and wept. But good {Pisanio},
291    When shall we heare from him.
292    <S {Pisa}.> Be assur'd Madam,
293    With his next vantage.
294    <S {Imo}.> I did not take my leaue of him, but had
295    Most pretty things to say: Ere I could tell him
296    How I would thinke on him at certaine houres,
297    Such thoughts, and such: Or I could make him sweare,
298    The Shees of Italy should not betray
299    Mine Interest, and his Honour: or haue charg'd him
300    At the sixt houre of Morne, at Noone, at Midnight,
301    T' encounter me with Orisons, for then
302    I am in Heauen for him: Or ere I could,
303    Giue him that parting kisse, which I had set
304    Betwixt two charming words, comes in my Father,
305    And like the Tyrannous breathing of the North,
306    Shakes all our buddes from growing.
307    <D {Enter a Lady}.>
308    <S {La}.> The Queene (Madam)
309    Desires your Highnesse Company.
310   *<S {Imo}.> Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd,
311    I will attend the Queene.
312    <S {Pisa}.> Madam, I shall.  <D {Exeunt}.>
313    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
314    <D {Enter Philario, Iachimo: a Frenchman, a Dutch-man},
315    {and a Spaniard}.>
316   *<S {Iach}.> Beleeue it Sir, I haue seene him in Britaine; hee
317   *was then of a Cressent note, expected to proue so woor-thy,
318   *as since he hath beene allowed the name of. But I
319   *could then haue look'd on him, without the help of Ad-miration,
320   *though the Catalogue of his endowments had
321    bin tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by Items.
322   *<S {Phil}.> You speake of him when he was lesse furnish'd,
323   *then now hee is, with that which makes him both with-out,
324    and within.
325   *<S {French}.> I haue seene him in France: wee had very ma-ny
326   *there, could behold the Sunne, with as firme eyes as
327    hee.
328   *<S {Iach}.> This matter of marrying his Kings Daughter,
329   *wherein he must be weighed rather by her valew, then
330   *his owne, words him (I doubt not) a great deale from the
331    matter.
332    <S {French}.> And then his banishment.
333   *<S {Iach}.> #I, and the approbation of those that weepe this
334   *lamentable diuorce vnder her colours, are wonderfully
      <P zz4v><C E>
335   *to extend him, be it but to fortifie her iudgement, which
336   *else an easie battery might lay flat, for taking a Begger
337   *without lesse quality. But how comes it, he is to soiourne
338    with you? How creepes acquaintance?
339   *<S {Phil}.> His Father and I were Souldiers together, to
340   *whom I haue bin often bound for no lesse then my life.
341    <D {Enter Posthumus}.>
342   *Heere comes the Britaine. Let him be so entertained a-mong'st
343   *you, as suites with Gentlemen of your knowing,
344   *to a Stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better
345   *knowne to this Gentleman, whom I commend to you,
346   *as a Noble Friend of mine. How Worthy he is, I will
347   *leaue to appeare hereafter, rather then story him in his
348    owne hearing.
349    <S {French}.> Sir, we haue knowne togither in Orleance.
350   *<S {Post}.> Since when, I haue bin debtor to you for courte-sies,
351    which I will be euer to pay, and yet pay still.
352   *<S {French}.> Sir, you o're- rate my poore kindnesse, I was
353   *glad I did attone my Countryman and you: it had beene
354   *pitty you should haue beene put together, with so mor-tall
355   *a purpose, as then each bore, vpon importance of so
356    slight and triuiall a nature.
357   *<S {Post}.> By your pardon Sir, I was then a young Trauel-ler,
358   *rather shun'd to go euen with what I heard, then in
359   *my euery action to be guided by others experiences: but
360   *vpon my mended iudgement (if I offend to say it is men-ded)
361    my Quarrell was not altogether slight.
362   *<S {French}.> Faith yes, to be put to the arbiterment of
363   *Swords, and by such two, that would by all likelyhood
364    haue confounded one the other, or haue falne both.
365   *<S {Iach}.> Can we with manners, aske what was the dif-ference?
366   _
367   *<S {French}.> Safely, I thinke, 'twas a contention in pub-licke,
368   *which may (without contradiction) suffer the re-port.
369   *It was much like an argument that fell out last
370   *night, where each of vs fell in praise of our Country- Mistresses.
371   *This Gentleman, at that time vouching (and
372   *vpon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more
373   *Faire, Vertuous, Wise, Chaste, Constant, Qualified, and
374   *lesse attemptible then any, the rarest of our Ladies in
375    Fraunce.
376   *<S {Iach}.> That Lady is not now liuing; or this Gentle-mans
377    opinion by this, worne out.
378    <S {Post}.> She holds her Vertue still, and I my mind.
379   *<S {Iach}.> You must not so farre preferre her, 'fore ours of
380    Italy.
381   *<S {Posth}.> Being so farre prouok'd as I was in France: I
382   *would abate her nothing, though I professe my selfe her
383    Adorer, not her Friend.
384   *<S {Iach}.> As faire, and as good: a kind of hand in hand
385   *comparison, had beene something too faire, and too
386   *good for any Lady in Britanie; if she went before others.
387   *I haue seene as that Diamond of yours out- lusters many
388   *I haue beheld, I could not beleeue she excelled many:
389   *but I haue not seene the most pretious Diamond that is,
390    nor you the Lady.
391    <S {Post}.> I prais'd her, as I rated her: so do I my Stone.
392    <S {Iach}.> What do you esteeme it at?
393    <S {Post}.> More then the world enioyes.
394   *<S {Iach}.> Either your vnparagon'd Mistris is dead, or
395    she's out- priz'd by a trifle.
396   *<S {Post}.> You are mistaken: the one may be solde or gi-uen,
397   *or if there were wealth enough for the purchases, or
398   *merite for the guift. The other is not a thing for sale,
399    and onely the guift of the Gods.
400    <S {Iach}.> Which the Gods haue giuen you?
401    <S {Post}.> Which by their Graces I will keepe.
402   *<S {Iach}.> You may weare her in title yours: but you
403   *know strange Fowle light vpon neighbouring Ponds.
404   *Your Ring may be stolne too, so your brace of vnprizea-ble
405   *Estimations, the one is but fraile, and the other Casu-all;
406   *A cunning Thiefe, or a (that way) accomplish'd
407   *Courtier, would hazzard the winning both of first and
408    last.
409   *<S {Post}.> Your Italy, containes none so accomplish'd a
410   *Courtier to conuince the Honour of my Mistris: if in the
411   *holding or losse of that, you terme her fraile, I do no-thing
412   *doubt you haue store of Theeues, notwithstanding
413    I feare not my Ring.
414    <S {Phil}.> Let vs leaue heere, Gentlemen?
415   *<S {Post}.> Sir, with all my heart. This worthy Signior I
416   *thanke him, makes no stranger of me, we are familiar at
417    first.
418   *<S {Iach}.> With fiue times so much conuersation, I should
419   *get ground of your faire Mistris; make her go backe, e-uen
420   *to the yeilding, had I admittance, and opportunitie
421    to friend.
422    <S {Post}.> No, no.
423   *<S {Iach}.> I dare thereupon pawne the moytie of my E-state,
424   *to your Ring, which in my opinion o're- values it
425   *something: but I make my wager rather against your
426   *Confidence, then her Reputation. And to barre your of-fence
427   *heerein #to, I durst attempt it against any Lady in
428    the world.
429   *<S {Post}.> You are a great deale abus'd in too bold a per-swasion,
430   *and I doubt not you sustaine what y'are worthy
431    of, by your Attempt.
432    <S {Iach}.> What's that?
433   *<S {Posth}.> A Repulse though your Attempt (as you call
434    it) deserue more; a punishment too.
435   *<S {Phi}.> Gentlemen enough of this, it came in too so-dainely,
436   *let it dye as it was borne, and I pray you be bet-ter
437    acquainted.
438   *<S {Iach}.> Would I had put my Estate, and my Neighbors
439    on th' approbation of what I haue spoke.
440    <S {Post}.> What Lady would you chuse to assaile?
441   *<S {Iach}.> Yours, whom in constancie you thinke stands
442   *so safe. I will lay you ten thousands Duckets to your
443   *Ring, that commend me to the Court where your La-dy
444   *is, with no more aduantage then the opportunitie of a
445   *second conference, and I will bring from thence, that
446    Honor of hers, which you imagine so reseru'd.
447   *<S {Posthmus}.> I will wage against your Gold, Gold to
448   *it: My Ring I holde deere as my finger, 'tis part of
449    it.
450   *<S {Iach}.> You are a Friend, and there in the wiser: if you
451   *buy Ladies flesh at a Million a Dram, you cannot pre-serue
452   *it from tainting; but I see you haue some Religion
453    in you, that you feare.
454   *<S {Posthu}.> This is but a custome in your tongue: you
455    beare a grauer purpose I hope.
456   *<S {Iach}.> I am the Master of my speeches, and would vn-der- go
457    what's spoken, I sweare.
458   *<S {Posthu}.> Will you? I shall but lend my Diamond till
459   *your returne: let there be Couenants drawne between's.
460   *My Mistris exceedes in goodnesse, the hugenesse of your
461   *vnworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: heere's my
462    Ring.
463    <S {Phil}.> I will haue it no lay.
464   *<S {Iach}.> By the Gods it is one: if I bring you no suffi-cient
465   *testimony that I haue enioy'd the deerest bodily
466   *part of your Mistris: my ten thousand Duckets are yours,
      <P zz5><C B>
467   *so is your Diamond too: if I come off, and leaue her in
468   *such honour as you haue trust in; Shee your Iewell, this
469   *your Iewell, and my Gold are yours: prouided, I haue
470    your commendation, for my more free entertainment.
471   *<S {Post}.> I embrace these Conditions, let vs haue Articles
472   *betwixt vs: onely thus farre you shall answere, if you
473   *make your voyage vpon her, and giue me directly to vn-derstand,
474   *you haue preuayl'd, I am no further your Ene-my,
475   *shee is not worth our debate. If shee remaine vnse-duc'd,
476   *you not making it appeare otherwise: for your #ill
477   *opinion, and th' assault you haue made to her chastity, you
478    shall answer me with your Sword.
479   *<S {Iach}.> Your hand, a Couenant: wee will haue these
480   *things set downe by lawfull Counsell, and straight away
481   *for Britaine, least the Bargaine should catch colde, and
482   *sterue: I will fetch my Gold, and haue our two Wagers
483    recorded.
484    <S {Post}.> Agreed.
485    <S {French}.> Will this hold, thinke you.
486    <S {Phil}.> Signior {Iachimo} will not from it.
487    Pray let vs follow 'em.  <D {Exeunt}>
488    <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
489    <D {Enter Queene, Ladies, and Cornelius}.>
490    <S {Qu}.> Whiles yet the dewe's on ground,
491    Gather those Flowers,
492    Make haste. Who ha's the note of them?
493    <S {Lady}.> I Madam.
494    <S {Queen}.> Dispatch.  <D {Exit Ladies}.>
495   *Now Master Doctor, haue you brought those drugges?
496   *<S {Cor}.> Pleaseth your Highnes, #I: here they are, Madam:
497    But I beseech your Grace, without offence
498    (My Conscience bids me aske) wherefore you haue
499    Commanded of me these most poysonous Compounds,
500    Which are the moouers of a languishing death:
501    But though slow, deadly.
502    <S {Qu}.> I wonder, Doctor,
503    Thou ask'st me such a Question: Haue I not bene
504    Thy Pupill long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
505    To make Perfumes? Distill? Preserue? Yea so,
506    That our great King himselfe doth woo me oft
507    For my Confections? Hauing thus farre proceeded,
508    (Vnlesse thou think'st me diuellish) is't not meete
509    That I did amplifie my iudgement in
510    Other Conclusions? I will try the forces
511    Of these thy Compounds, on such Creatures as
512    We count not worth the hanging (but none humane)
513    To try the vigour of them, and apply
514    Allayments to their Act, and by them gather
515    Their seuerall vertues, and effects.
516    <S {Cor}.> Your Highnesse
517    Shall from this practise, but make hard your heart:
518    Besides, the seeing these effects will be
519    Both noysome, and infectious.
520    <S {Qu}.> O content thee.
521    <D {Enter Pisanio}.>
522    Heere comes a flattering Rascall, vpon him
523    Will I first worke: Hee's for his Master,
524    And enemy to my Sonne. How now {Pisanio}?
525    Doctor, your seruice for this time is ended,
526    Take your owne way.
527    <S {Cor}.> I do suspect you, Madam,
528    But you shall do no harme.
529    <S {Qu}.> Hearke thee, a word.
530    <S {Cor}.> I do not like her. She doth thinke she ha's
531    Strange ling'ring poysons: I do know her spirit,
532    And will not trust one of her malice, with
533    A drugge of such damn'd Nature. Those she ha's,
534    Will stupifie and dull the Sense a- while,
535    Which first (perchance) shee'l proue on Cats and Dogs,
536    Then afterward vp higher: but there is
537    No danger in what shew of death it makes,
538    More then the locking vp the Spirits a time,
539    To be more fresh, reuiuing. She is fool'd
540    With a most false effect: and I, the truer,
541    So to be false with her.
542    <S {Qu}.> No further seruice, Doctor,
543    Vntill I send for thee.
544    <S {Cor}.> I humbly take my leaue.  <D {Exit}.>
545    <S {Qu}.> Weepes she still (saist thou?)
546    Dost thou thinke in time
547    She will not quench, and let instructions enter
548    Where Folly now possesses? Do thou worke:
549    When thou shalt bring me word she loues my Sonne,
550    Ile tell thee on the instant, thou art then
551    As great as is thy Master: Greater, for
552    His Fortunes all lye speechlesse, and his name
553    Is at last gaspe. Returne he cannot, nor
554    Continue where he is: To shift his being,
555    Is to exchange one misery with another,
556    And euery day that comes, comes to decay
557    A dayes worke in him. What shalt thou expect
558    To be depender on a thing that leanes?
559    Who cannot be new built, nor ha's no Friends
560    So much, as but to prop him? Thou tak'st vp
561    Thou know'st not what: But take it for thy labour,
562    It is a thing I made, which hath the King
563    Fiue times redeem'd from death. I do not know
564    What is more Cordiall. Nay, I prythee take it,
565    It is an earnest of a farther good
566    That I meane to thee. Tell thy Mistris how
567    The case stands with her: doo't, as from thy selfe;
568    Thinke what a chance thou changest on, but thinke
569    Thou hast thy Mistris still, to boote, my Sonne,
570    Who shall take notice of thee. Ile moue the King
571    To any shape of thy Preferment, such
572    As thou'lt desire: and then my selfe, I cheefely,
573    That set thee on to this desert, am bound
574   *To loade thy merit richly. Call my women.  <D {Exit Pisa}.>
575    Thinke on my words. A slye, and constant knaue,
576    Not to be shak'd: the Agent for his Master,
577    And the Remembrancer of her, to hold
578    The hand- fast to her Lord. I haue giuen him that,
579    Which if he take, shall quite vnpeople her
580    Of Leidgers for her Sweete: and which, she after
581    Except she bend her humor, shall be assur'd
582    To taste of too.
583    <D {Enter Pisanio, and Ladies}.>
584    So, so: Well done, well done:
585    The Violets, Cowslippes, and the Prime- Roses
586    Beare to my Closset: Fare thee well, {Pisanio}.
587    Thinke on my words.  <D {Exit Qu. and Ladies}>
588    <S {Pisa}.> And shall do:
589    But when to my good Lord, I proue vntrue,
590    Ile choake my selfe: there's all Ile do for you.  <D {Exit}.>
      <P zz5v><C E>
591    <Z {Scena Septima}.>
592    <D {Enter Imogen alone}.>
593    <S {Imo}.> A Father cruell, and a Stepdame false,
594    A Foolish Suitor to a Wedded- Lady,
595    That hath her Husband banish'd: O, that Husband,
596    My supreame Crowne of griefe, and those repeated
597    Vexations of it. Had I bin Theefe- stolne,
598    As my two Brothers, happy: but most miserable
599    Is the desires that's glorious. Blessed be those
600    How meane so ere, that haue their honest wills,
601    Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fye.
602    <D {Enter Pisanio, and Iachimo}.>
603    <S {Pisa}.> Madam, a Noble Gentleman of Rome,
604    Comes from my Lord with Letters.
605    <S {Iach}.> Change you, Madam:
606    The Worthy {Leonatus} is in safety,
607    And greetes your Highnesse deerely.
608    <S {Imo}.> Thanks good Sir,
609    You're kindly welcome.
610    <S {Iach}.> All of her, that is out of doore, most rich:
611    If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
612    She is alone th' Arabian- Bird; and I
613    Haue lost the wager. Boldnesse be my Friend:
614    Arme me Audacitie from head to foote,
615    Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight,
616    Rather directly fly.
617    <S {Imogen reads}.>
618   *{He is one of the Noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am most in-finitely}
619   *{tied. Reflect vpon him accordingly, as you value your}
620    {trust}. Leonatus.
621    So farre I reade aloud.
622    But euen the very middle of my heart
623    Is warm'd by'th' rest, and take it thankefully.
624    You are as welcome (worthy Sir) as I
625    Haue words to bid you, and shall finde it so
626    In all that I can do.
627    <S {Iach}.> Thankes fairest Lady:
628    What are men mad? Hath Nature giuen them eyes
629    To see this vaulted Arch, and the rich Crop
630    Of Sea and Land, which can distinguish 'twixt
631    The firie Orbes aboue, and the twinn'd Stones
632    Vpon the number'd Beach, and can we not
633    Partition make with Spectacles so pretious
634    Twixt faire, and foule?
635    <S {Imo}.> What makes your admiration?
636    <S {Iach}.> It cannot be i'th' eye: for Apes, and Monkeys
637    'Twixt two such She's, would chatter this way, and
638   *Contemne with mowes the other. Nor i'th' iudgment:
639    For Idiots in this case of fauour, would
640    Be wisely definit: Nor i'th' Appetite.
641    Sluttery to such neate Excellence, oppos'd
642    Should make desire vomit emptinesse,
643    Not so allur'd to feed.
644    <S {Imo}.> What is the matter trow?
645    <S {Iach}.> The Cloyed #will:
646    That satiate yet vnsatisfi'd desire, that Tub
647    Both fill'd and running: Rauening first the Lambe,
648    Longs after for the Garbage.
649    <S {Imo}.> What, deere Sir,
650    Thus rap's you? Are you well?
651    <S {Iach}.> Thanks Madam well: Beseech you Sir,
652    Desire my Man's abode, where I did leaue him:
653    He's strange and peeuish.
654    <S {Pisa}.> I was going Sir,
655    To giue him welcome.  <D {Exit}.>
656    <S {Imo}.> Continues well my Lord?
657    His health beseech you?
658    <S {Iach}.> Well, Madam.
659    <S {Imo}.> Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.
660    <S {Iach}.> Exceeding pleasant: none a stranger there,
661    So merry, and so gamesome: he is call'd
662    The Britaine Reueller.
663    <S {Imo}.> When he was heere
664    He did incline to sadnesse, and oft times
665    Not knowing why.
666    <S {Iach}.> I neuer saw him sad.
667    There is a Frenchman his Companion, one
668    An eminent Monsieur, that it seemes much loues
669    A Gallian- Girle at home. He furnaces
670    The thicke sighes from him; whiles the iolly Britaine,
671   *(Your Lord I meane) laughes from's free lungs: cries oh,
672    Can my sides hold, to think that man who knowes
673    By History, Report, or his owne proofe
674    What woman is, yea what she cannot choose
675    But must be: will's free houres languish:
676    For assured bondage?
677    <S {Imo}.> Will my Lord say so?
678   *<S {Iach}.> #I Madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter,
679    It is a Recreation to be by
680    And heare him mocke the Frenchman:
681    But Heauen's know some men are much #too blame.
682    <S {Imo}.> Not he I hope.
683    <S {Iach}.> Not he:
684    But yet Heauen's bounty towards him, might
685    Be vs'd more thankfully. In himselfe 'tis much;
686    In you, which I account his beyond all Talents.
687    Whil'st I am bound to wonder, I am bound
688    To pitty #too.
689    <S {Imo}.> What do you pitty Sir?
690    <S {Iach}.> Two Creatures heartyly.
691    <S {Imo}.> Am I one Sir?
692    You looke on me: what wrack discerne you in me
693    Deserues your pitty?
694    <S {Iach}.> Lamentable: what
695    To hide me from the radiant Sun, and solace
696    I'th' Dungeon by a Snuffe.
697    <S {Imo}.> I pray you Sir,
698    Deliuer with more opennesse your answeres
699    To my demands. Why do you pitty me?
700    <S {Iach}.> That others do,
701    (I was about to say) enioy your=== but
702    It is an office of the Gods to venge it,
703    Not mine to speake on't.
704    <S {Imo}.> You do seeme to know
705    Something of me, or what concernes me; pray you
706    Since doubting things go #ill, often hurts more
707    Then to be sure they do. For Certainties
708    Either are past remedies; or timely knowing,
709    The remedy then borne. Discouer to me
710    What both you spur and stop.
711    <S {Iach}.> Had I this cheeke
712    To bathe my lips vpon: this hand, whose touch,
713    (Whose euery touch) would force the Feelers soule
714    To'th' oath of loyalty. This obiect, which
715    Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
716    Fiering it onely heere, should I (damn'd then)
      <P zz6><C B>
717    Slauuer with lippes as common as the stayres
718    That mount the Capitoll: Ioyne gripes, with hands
719    Made hard with hourely falshood (falshood as
720    With labour:) then by peeping in an eye
721    Base and illustrious as the smoakie light
722    That's fed with stinking Tallow: it were fit
723    That all the plagues of #Hell should at one time
724    Encounter such reuolt.
725    <S {Imo}.> My Lord, I feare
726    Has forgot Brittaine.
727    <S {Iach}.> And himselfe, not I
728    Inclin'd to this intelligence, pronounce
729    The Beggery of his change: but 'tis your Graces
730    That from my mutest Conscience, to my tongue,
731    Charmes this report out.
732    <S {Imo}.> Let me heare no more.
733   *<S {Iach}.> O deerest Soule: your Cause doth strike my hart
734    With pitty, that doth make me sicke. A Lady
735    So faire, and fasten'd to an Emperie
736    Would make the great'st King double, to be partner'd
737    With Tomboyes hyr'd, with that selfe exhibition
738   *Which your owne Coffers yeeld: with diseas'd ventures
739    That play with all Infirmities for Gold,
740    Which rottennesse can lend Nature. Such boyl'd stuffe
741    As well might poyson Poyson. Be reueng'd,
742    Or she that bore you, was no Queene, and you
743    Recoyle from your great Stocke.
744    <S {Imo}.> Reueng'd:
745    How should I be reueng'd? If this be true,
746    (As I haue such a Heart, that both mine eares
747    Must not in haste abuse) if it be true,
748    How should I be reueng'd?
749    <S {Iach}.> Should he make me
750    Liue like {Diana's} Priest, betwixt cold sheets,
751    Whiles he is vaulting variable Rampes
752    In your despight, vpon your purse: reuenge it.
753    I dedicate my selfe to your sweet pleasure,
754    More Noble then that runnagate to your bed,
755    And will continue fast to your Affection,
756    Still close, as sure.
757    <S {Imo}.> What hoa, {Pisanio}?
758    <S {Iach}.> Let me my seruice tender on your lippes.
759    <S {Imo}.> Away, I do condemne mine eares, that haue
760    So long attended thee. If thou wert Honourable
761    Thou would'st haue told this tale for Vertue, not
762    For such an end thou seek'st, as base, as strange:
763    Thou wrong'st a Gentleman, who is as farre
764    From thy report, as thou from Honor: and
765    Solicites heere a Lady, that disdaines
766    Thee, and the Diuell alike. What hoa, {Pisanio}?
767    The King my Father shall be made acquainted
768    Of thy Assault: if he shall thinke it fit,
769    A sawcy Stranger in his Court, to Mart
770    As in a Romish Stew, and to expound
771    His beastly minde to vs; he hath a Court
772    He little cares for, and a Daughter, who
773    He not respects at all. What hoa, {Pisanio}?
774    <S {Iach}.> O happy {Leonatus} I may say,
775    The credit that thy Lady hath of thee
776    Deserues thy trust, and thy most perfect goodnesse
777    Her assur'd credit. Blessed liue you long,
778    A Lady to the worthiest #Sir, that euer
779    Country call'd his; and you his Mistris, onely
780    For the most worthiest fit. Giue me your pardon,
781    I haue spoke this to know if your Affiance
782    Were deeply rooted, and shall make your Lord,
783    That which he is, new o're: And he is one
784    The truest manner'd: such a holy Witch,
785    That he enchants Societies into him:
786    Halfe all men hearts are his.
787    <S {Imo}.> You make amends.
788    <S {Iach}.> He sits 'mongst men, like a defended God;
789    He hath a kinde of Honor sets him off,
790    More then a mortall seeming. Be not angrie
791    (Most mighty Princesse) that I haue aduentur'd
792    To try your taking of a false report, which hath
793    Honour'd with confirmation your great Iudgement,
794    In the election of a #Sir, so rare,
795    Which you know, cannot erre. The loue I beare him,
796    Made me to fan you thus, but the Gods made you
797    (Vnlike all others) chaffelesse. Pray your pardon.
798    <S {Imo}.> All's well Sir:
799    Take my powre i'th' Court for yours.
800    <S {Iach}.> My humble thankes: I had almost forgot
801    T' intreat your Grace, but in a small request,
802    And yet of moment too, for it concernes:
803    Your Lord, my selfe, and other Noble Friends
804    Are partners in the businesse.
805    <S {Imo}.> Pray what is't?
806    <S {Iach}.> Some dozen Romanes of vs, and your Lord
807    (The best Feather of our wing) haue mingled summes
808    To buy a Present for the Emperor:
809    Which I (the Factor for the rest) haue done
810    In France: 'tis Plate of rare deuice, and Iewels
811    Of rich, and exquisite forme, their valewes great,
812    And I am something curious, being strange
813    To haue them in safe stowage: May it please you
814    To take them in protection.
815    <S {Imo}.> Willingly:
816    And pawne mine Honor for their safety, since
817    My Lord hath interest in them, I will keepe them
818    In my Bed- chamber.
819    <S {Iach}.> They are in a Trunke
820    Attended by my men: I will make bold
821    To send them to you, onely for this night:
822    I must aboord to morrow.
823    <S {Imo}.> O no, no.
824    <S {Iach}.> Yes I beseech: or I shall short my word
825    By length'ning my returne. From Gallia,
826    I crost the Seas on purpose, and on promise
827    To see your Grace.
828    <S {Imo}.> I thanke you for your paines:
829    But not away to morrow.
830    <S {Iach}.> O I must Madam.
831    Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
832    To greet your Lord with writing, doo't to night,
833    I haue out- stood my time, which is materiall
834    To'th' tender of our Present.
835    <S {Imo}.> I will write:
836    Send your Trunke to me, it shall safe be kept,
837   *And truely yeelded you: you're very welcome.  <D {Exeunt}.>
838    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
839    <D {Enter Clotten, and the two Lords}.>
840   *<S {Clot}.> Was there euer man had such lucke? when I kist
841   *the Iacke vpon an vp- cast, to be hit away? I had a hun-dred
842   *pound on't: and then a whorson Iacke- an- Apes,
      <P zz6v><C E>
843   *must take me vp for swearing, as if I borrowed mine
844   *oathes of him, and might not spend them at my pleasure.
845   *<S 1.> What got he by that? you haue broke his pate
846    with your Bowle.
847   *<S 2.> If his wit had bin like him that broke it: it would
848    haue run all out.
849   *<S {Clot}.> When a Gentleman is dispos'd to sweare: it is
850    not for any standers by to curtall his oathes. Ha?
851    <S 2.> No my Lord; nor crop the eares of them.
852   *<S {Clot}.> Whorson dog: I gaue him satisfaction? would
853    he had bin one of my Ranke.
854    <S 2.> To haue smell'd like a Foole.
855   *<S {Clot}.> I am not vext more at any thing in th' earth: a
856   *pox on't I had rather not be so Noble as I am: they dare
857   *not fight with me, because of the Queene my Mo-ther:
858   *euery Iacke- Slaue hath his belly full of Fighting,
859   *and I must go vp and downe like a Cock, that no body
860    can match.
861   *<S 2.> You are Cocke and Capon too, and you crow
862    Cock, with your combe on.
863    <S {Clot}.> Sayest thou?
864   *<S 2.> It is not fit your Lordship should vndertake euery
865    Companion, that you giue offence #too.
866   *<S {Clot}.> No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
867    offence to my inferiors.
868    <S 2.> #I, it is fit for your Lordship onely.
869    <S {Clot}.> Why so I say.
870   *<S 1.> Did you heere of a Stranger that's come to Court
871    night?
872    <S {Clot}.> A Stranger, and I not know on't?
873   *<S 2.> He's a strange Fellow himselfe, and knowes it not.
874   *<S 1.> There's an Italian come, and 'tis thought one of
875    {Leonatus} Friends.
876   *<S {Clot}.> {Leonatus}? A banisht Rascall; and he's another,
877    whatsoeuer he be. Who told you of this Stranger?
878    <S 1.> One of your Lordships Pages.
879   *<S {Clot}.> Is it fit I went to looke vpon him? Is there no
880    derogation in't?
881    <S 2.> You cannot derogate my Lord.
882    <S {Clot}.> Not easily I thinke.
883   *<S 2.> You are a Foole graunted, therefore your Issues
884    being foolish do not derogate.
885   *<S {Clot}.> Come, Ile go see this Italian: what I haue lost
886   *to day at Bowles, Ile winne to night of him. Come: go.
887    <S 2.> Ile attend your Lordship.  <D {Exit}.>
888    That such a craftie Diuell as is his Mother
889    Should yeild the world this Asse: A woman, that
890    Beares all downe with her Braine, and this her Sonne,
891    Cannot take two from twenty for his heart,
892    And leaue eighteene. Alas poore Princesse,
893    Thou diuine {Imogen}, what thou endur'st,
894    Betwixt a Father by thy Step- dame gouern'd,
895    A Mother hourely coyning plots: A Wooer,
896    More hatefull then the foule expulsion is
897    Of thy deere Husband. Then that horrid Act
898    Of the diuorce, heel'd make the Heauens hold firme
899    The walls of thy deere Honour. Keepe vnshak'd
900    That Temple thy faire mind, that thou maist stand
901   *T' enioy thy banish'd Lord: and this great Land.  <D {Exeunt}.>
902    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
903    <D {Enter Imogen, in her Bed, and a Lady}.>
904    <S {Imo}.> Who's there? My woman: {Helene}?
905    <S {La}.> Please you Madam.
906    <S {Imo}.> What houre is it?
907    <S {Lady}.> Almost midnight, Madam.
908    <S {Imo}.> I haue read three houres then:
909    Mine eyes are weake,
910    Fold downe the leafe where I haue left: to bed.
911    Take not away the Taper, leaue it burning:
912    And if thou canst awake by foure o'th' clock,
913    I prythee call me: Sleepe hath ceiz'd me wholly.
914    To your protection I commend me, Gods,
915    From Fayries, and the Tempters of the night,
916    Guard me beseech yee.  <D {Sleepes}.>
917    <D {Iachimo from the Trunke}.>
918    <S {Iach}.> The Crickets sing, and mans ore- labor'd sense
919    Repaires it selfe by rest: Our {Tarquine} thus
920    Did softly presse the Rushes, ere he waken'd
921    The Chastitie he wounded. {Cytherea},
922    How brauely thou becom'st thy Bed; fresh Lilly,
923    And whiter then the Sheetes: that I might touch,
924    But kisse, one kisse. Rubies vnparagon'd,
925    How deerely they doo't: 'Tis her breathing that
926    Perfumes the Chamber thus: the Flame o'th' Taper
927    Bowes toward her, and would vnder- peepe her lids.
928    To see th' inclosed Lights, now Canopied
929    Vnder these windowes, White and Azure lac'd
930    With Blew of Heauens owne tinct. But my designe.
931    To note the Chamber, I will write all downe,
932    Such, and such pictures: There the window, such
933    Th' adornement of her Bed; the Arras, Figures,
934    Why such, and such: and the Contents o'th' Story.
935    Ah, but some naturall notes about her Body,
936    Aboue ten thousand meaner Moueables
937    Would testifie, t' enrich mine Inuentorie.
938    O sleepe, thou Ape of death, lye dull vpon her,
939    And be her Sense but as a Monument,
940    Thus in a Chappell lying. Come off, come off;
941    As slippery as the Gordian- knot was hard.
942    'Tis mine, and this will witnesse outwardly,
943    As strongly as the Conscience do's within:
944    To'th' madding of her Lord. On her left brest
945    A mole Cinque- spotted: Like the Crimson drops
946    I'th' bottome of a Cowslippe. Heere's a Voucher,
947    Stronger then euer Law could make; this Secret
948    Will force him thinke I haue pick'd the lock, and t'ane
949    The treasure of her Honour. No more: to what end?
950    Why should I write this downe, that's riueted,
951    Screw'd to my memorie. She hath bin reading late,
952    The Tale of {Tereus}, heere the leaffe's turn'd downe
953    Where {Philomele} gaue vp. I haue enough,
954    To'th' Truncke againe, and shut the spring of it.
955    Swift, swift, you Dragons of the night, that dawning
956    May beare the Rauens eye: I lodge in feare,
957    Though this a heauenly Angell: #hell is heere.
958    <D {Clocke strikes}>
959    One, two, three: time, time. <D {Exit}.>
960    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
961    <D {Enter Clotten, and Lords}.>
962   *<S 1.> Your Lordship is the most patient man in losse, the
963    most coldest that euer turn'd vp Ace.
964    <S {Clot}.> It would make any man cold to loose.
965   *<S 1.> But not euery man patient after the noble temper
966   *of your Lordship; You are most hot, and furious when
967    you winne.
      <P aaa1><C B>
968   *Winning will put any man into courage: if I could get
969   *this foolish {Imogen}, I should haue Gold enough: it's al-most
970    morning, is't not?
971    <S 1> Day, my Lord.
972   *<S {Clot}.> I would this Musicke would come: I am adui-sed
973   *to giue her Musicke #a mornings, they say it will pene-trate.
974    <D {Enter Musitians}.>
975   *Come on, tune: If you can penetrate her with your fin-gering,
976   *so: wee'l try with tongue too: if none will do, let
977   *her remaine: but Ile neuer giue o're. First, a very excel-lent
978   *good conceyted thing; after a wonderful sweet aire,
979   *with admirable rich words to it, and then let her consi-der.

993    <D {Enter Cymbaline, and Queene}.>
994    <S 2> Heere comes the King.
995   *<S {Clot}.> I am glad I was vp so late, for that's the reason
996   *I was vp so earely: he cannot choose but take this Ser-uice
997   *I haue done, fatherly. Good morrow to your Ma-iesty,
998    and to my gracious Mother.
999   *<S {Cym}.> Attend you here the doore of our stern daughter
1000   Will she not forth?
1001  *<S {Clot}.> I haue assayl'd her with Musickes, but she vouch-safes
1002   no notice.
1003   <S {Cym}.> The Exile of her Minion is too new,
1004   She hath not yet forgot him, some more time
1005   Must weare the print of his remembrance on't,
1006   And then she's yours.
1007   <S {Qu}.> You are most bound to'th' King,
1008   Who let's go by no vantages, that may
1009   Preferre you to his daughter: Frame your selfe
1010   To orderly solicity, and be friended
1011   With aptnesse of the season: make denials
1012   Encrease your Seruices: so seeme, as if
1013   You were inspir'd to do those duties which
1014   You tender to her: that you in all obey her,
1015   Saue when command to your dismission tends,
1016   And therein you are senselesse.
1017   <S {Clot}.> Senselesse? Not so.
1018   <S {Mes}.> So like you (Sir) Ambassadors from Rome;
1019   The one is {Caius Lucius}.
1020   <S {Cym}.> A worthy Fellow,
1021   Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
1022   But that's no fault of his: we must receyue him
1023   According to the Honor of his Sender,
1024   And towards himselfe, his goodnesse fore- spent on vs
1025   We must extend our notice: Our deere Sonne,
1026   When you haue giuen good morning to your Mistris,
1027   Attend the Queene, and vs, we shall haue neede
1028   T' employ you towards this Romane.
1029   Come our Queene.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1030   <S {Clot}.> If she be vp, Ile speake with her: if not
1031   Let her lye still, and dreame: by your leaue hoa,
1032   I know her women are about her: what
1033   If I do line one of their hands, 'tis Gold
1034   Which buyes admittance (oft it doth) yea, and makes
1035   {Diana's} Rangers false themselues, yeeld vp
1036   Their Deere to'th' stand o'th' Stealer: and 'tis Gold
1037  *Which makes the True- man kill'd, and saues the Theefe:
1038  *Nay, sometime hangs both Theefe, and True- man: what
1039   Can it not do, and vndoo? I will make
1040   One of her women Lawyer to me, for
1041   I yet not vnderstand the case my selfe.
1042   By your leaue.  <D {Knockes}.>
1043   <D {Enter a Lady}.>
1044   <S {La}.> Who's there that knockes?
1045   <S {Clot}.> A Gentleman.
1046   <S {La}.> No more.
1047   <S {Clot}.> Yes, and a Gentlewomans Sonne.
1048   <S {La}.> That's more
1049   Then some whose Taylors are as deere as yours,
1050   Can iustly boast of: what's your Lordships pleasure?
1051   <S {Clot}.> Your Ladies person, is she ready?
1052   <S {La}.> #I, to keepe her Chamber.
1053   <S {Clot}.> There is Gold for you,
1054   Sell me your good report.
1055   <S {La}.> How, my good name? or to report of you
1056   What I shall thinke is good. The Princesse.
1057   <D {Enter Imogen}.>
1058   <S {Clot}.> Good morrow fairest, Sister your sweet hand.
1059  *<S {Imo}.> Good morrow Sir, you lay out too much paines
1060   For purchasing but trouble: the thankes I giue,
1061   Is telling you that I am poore of thankes,
1062   And scarse can spare them.
1063   <S {Clot}.> Still I sweare I loue you.
1064   <S {Imo}.> If you but said so, 'twere as deepe with me:
1065   If you sweare still, your recompence is still
1066   That I regard it not.
1067   <S {Clot}.> This is no answer.
1068   <S {Imo}.> But that you shall not say, I yeeld being silent,
1069   I would not speake. I pray you spare me, 'faith
1070   I shall vnfold equall discourtesie
1071   To your best kindnesse: one of your great knowing
1072   Should learne (being taught) forbearance.
1073   <S {Clot}.> To leaue you in your madnesse, 'twere my sin,
1074   I will not.
1075   <S {Imo}.> Fooles are not mad Folkes.
1076   <S {Clot}.> Do you call me Foole?
1077   <S {Imo}.> As I am mad I do:
1078   If you'l be patient, Ile no more be mad,
1079   That cures vs both. I am much sorry (Sir)
1080   You put me to forget a Ladies manners
1081   By being so verball: and learne now, for all,
1082   That I which know my heart, do heere pronounce
1083   By th' very truth of it, I care not for you,
1084   And am so neere the lacke of Charitie
1085   To accuse my selfe, I hate you: which I had rather
1086   You felt, then make't my boast.
1087   <S {Clot}.> You sinne against
1088   Obedience, which you owe your Father, for
1089   The Contract you pretend with that base Wretch,
1090   One, bred of Almes, and foster'd with cold dishes,
1091   With scraps o'th' Court: It is no Contract, none;
1092   And though it be allowed in meaner parties
1093   (Yet who then he more meane) to knit their soules
1094   (On whom there is no more dependancie
1095   But Brats and Beggery) in selfe- figur'd knot,
1096   Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement, by
      <P aaa1v><C E>
1097   The consequence o'th' Crowne, and must not foyle
1098   The precious note of it; with a base Slaue,
1099   A Hilding for a Liuorie, a Squires Cloth,
1100   A Pantler; not so eminent.
1101   <S {Imo}.> Prophane Fellow:
1102   Wert thou the Sonne of {Iupiter}, and no more,
1103   But what thou art besides: thou wer't too base,
1104   To be his Groome: thou wer't dignified enough
1105   Euen to the point of Enuie. If 'twere made
1106   Comparatiue for your Vertues, to be stil'd
1107   The vnder Hangman of his Kingdome; and hated
1108   For being prefer'd so well.
1109   <S {Clot}.> The South- Fog rot him.
1110  *<S {Imo}.> He neuer can meete more mischance, then come
1111   To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st Garment
1112   That euer hath but clipt his body; is dearer
1113   In my respect, then all the Heires aboue thee,
1114   Were they all made such men: How now {Pisanio}?
1115   <D {Enter Pisanio}.>
1116   <S {Clot}.> His Garments? Now the diuell.
1117   <S {Imo}.> To {Dorothy} my woman hie thee presently.
1118   <S {Clot}.> His Garment?
1119   <S {Imo}.> I am sprighted with a Foole,
1120   Frighted, and angred worse: Go bid my woman
1121   Search for a Iewell, that too casually
1122   Hath left mine Arme: it was thy Masters. Shrew me
1123   If I would loose it for a Reuenew,
1124   Of any Kings in Europe. I do think,
1125   I saw't this morning: Confident I am.
1126   Last night 'twas on mine Arme; I kiss'd it,
1127   I hope it be not gone, to tell my Lord
1128   That I kisse aught but he.
1129   <S {Pis}.> 'Twill not be lost.
1130   <S {Imo}.> I hope so: go and search.
1131   <S {Clot}.> You haue abus'd me:
1132   His meanest Garment?
1133   <S {Imo}.> #I, I said so Sir,
1134   If you will make't an Action, call witnesse to't.
1135   <S {Clot}.> I will enforme your Father.
1136   <S {Imo}.> Your Mother too:
1137   She's my good Lady; and will concieue, I hope
1138   But the worst of me. So I leaue you Sir,
1139   To'th' worst of discontent.  <D {Exit}.>
1140   <S {Clot}.> Ile be reueng'd:
1141   His mean'st Garment? Well.  <D {Exit}.>
1142   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1143   <D {Enter Posthumus, and Philario}.>
1144   <S {Post}.> Feare it not Sir: I would I were so sure
1145   To winne the King, as I am bold, her Honour
1146   Will remaine her's.
1147   <S {Phil}.> What meanes do you make to him?
1148   <S {Post}.> Not any: but abide the change of Time,
1149   Quake in the present winters state, and wish
1150   That warmer dayes would come: In these fear'd hope
1151   I barely gratifie your loue; they fayling
1152   I must die much your debtor.
1153   <S {Phil}.> Your very goodnesse, and your company,
1154   Ore- payes all I can do. By this your King,
1155   Hath heard of Great {Augustus}: {Caius Lucius},
1156   Will #do's Commission throughly. And I think
1157   Hee'le grant the Tribute: send th' Arrerages,
1158   Or looke vpon our Romaines, whose remembrance
1159   Is yet fresh in their griefe.
1160   <S {Post}.> I do beleeue
1161   (Statist though I am none, nor like to be)
1162   That this will proue a Warre; and you shall heare
1163   The Legion now in Gallia, sooner landed
1164   In our not- fearing- Britaine, then haue tydings
1165   Of any penny Tribute paid. Our Countrymen
1166   Are men more order'd, then when {Iulius Caesar}
1167   Smil'd at their lacke of skill, but found their courage
1168   Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
1169  *(Now wing- led with their courages) will make knowne
1170   To their Approuers, they are People, such
1171   That mend vpon the world.  <D {Enter Iachimo}.>
1172   <S {Phi}.> See {Iachimo}.
1173   <S {Post}.> The swiftest Harts, haue posted you by land;
1174   And Windes of all the Corners kiss'd your Sailes,
1175   To make your vessell nimble.
1176   <S {Phil}.> Welcome Sir.
1177   <S {Post}.> I hope the briefenesse of your answere, made
1178   The speedinesse of your returne.
1179   <S {Iachi}.> Your Lady,
1180   Is one of the fayrest that I haue look'd vpon
1181   <S {Post}.> And therewithall the best, or let her beauty
1182   Looke thorough a Casement to allure false hearts,
1183   And be false with them.
1184   <S {Iachi}.> Heere are Letters for you.
1185   <S {Post}.> Their tenure good I trust.
1186   <S {Iach}.> 'Tis very like.
1187   <S {Post}.> Was {Caius Lucius} in the Britaine Court,
1188   When you were there?
1189   <S {Iach}.> He was expected then,
1190   But not approach'd.
1191   <S {Post}.> All is well yet,
1192   Sparkles this Stone as it was wont, or is't not
1193   Too dull for your good wearing?
1194   <S {Iach}.> If I haue lost it,
1195   I should haue lost the worth of it in Gold,
1196   Ile make a iourney twice as farre, t' enioy
1197   A second night of such sweet shortnesse, which
1198   Was mine in Britaine, for the Ring is wonne.
1199   <S {Post}.> The Stones too hard to come by.
1200   <S {Iach}.> Not a whit,
1201   Your Lady being so easy.
1202   <S {Post}.> Make note Sir
1203   Your losse, your Sport: I hope you know that we
1204   Must not continue Friends.
1205   <S {Iach}.> Good Sir, we must
1206   If you keepe Couenant: had I not brought
1207   The knowledge of your Mistris home, I grant
1208   We were to question farther; but I now
1209   Professe my selfe the winner of her Honor,
1210   Together with your Ring; and not the wronger
1211   Of her, or you hauing proceeded but
1212   By both your willes.
1213   <S {Post}.> If you can mak't apparant
1214   That you haue tasted her in Bed; my hand,
1215   And Ring is yours. If not, the foule opinion
1216   You had of her pure Honour; gaines, or looses,
1217   Your Sword, or mine, or Masterlesse leaue both
1218   To who shall finde them.
1219   <S {Iach}.> Sir, my Circumstances
1220   Being so nere the Truth, as I will make them,
1221   Must first induce you to beleeue; whose strength
1222   I will confirme with oath, which I doubt not
      <P aaa2><C B>
1223   You'l giue me leaue to spare, when you shall finde
1224   You neede it not.
1225   <S {Post}.> Proceed.
1226   <S {Iach}.> First, her Bed- chamber
1227   (Where I confesse I slept not, but professe
1228   Had that was well worth watching) it was hang'd
1229   With Tapistry of Silke, and Siluer, the Story
1230   Proud {Cleopatra}, when she met her Roman,
1231   And {Sidnus} swell'd aboue the Bankes, or for
1232   The presse of Boates, or Pride. A peece of Worke
1233   So brauely done, so rich, that it did striue
1234   In Workemanship, and Value, which I wonder'd
1235   Could be so rarely, and exactly wrought
1236   Since the true life on't was===
1237   <S {Post}.> This is true:
1238   And this you might haue heard of heere, by me,
1239   Or by some other.
1240   <S {Iach}.> More particulars
1241   Must iustifie my knowledge.
1242   <S {Post}.> So they must,
1243   Or doe your Honour iniury.
1244   <S {Iach}.> The Chimney
1245   Is South the Chamber, and the Chimney- peece
1246   Chaste {Dian}, bathing: neuer saw I figures
1247   So likely to report themselues; the Cutter
1248   Was as another Nature dumbe, out- went her,
1249   Motion, and Breath left out.
1250   <S {Post}.> This is a thing
1251   Which you might from Relation likewise reape,
1252   Being, as it is, much spoke of.
1253   <S {Iach}.> The Roofe o'th' Chamber,
1254   With golden Cherubins is fretted. Her Andirons
1255   (I had forgot them) were two winking Cupids
1256   Of Siluer, each on one foote standing, nicely
1257   Depending on their Brands.
1258   <S {Post}.> This is her Honor:
1259   Let it be granted you haue seene all this (and praise
1260   Be giuen to your remembrance) the description
1261   Of what is in her Chamber, nothing saues
1262   The wager you haue laid.
1263   <S {Iach}.> Then if you can
1264   Be pale, I begge but leaue to ayre this Iewell: See,
1265   And now 'tis vp againe: it must be married
1266   To that your Diamond, Ile keepe them.
1267   <S {Post}.> Ioue===
1268   Once more let me behold it: Is it that
1269   Which I left with her?
1270   <S {Iach}.> Sir (I thanke her) that
1271   She stript it from her Arme: I see her yet:
1272   Her pretty Action, did out- sell her guift,
1273   And yet enrich'd it too: she gaue it me,
1274   And said, she priz'd it once.
1275   <S {Post}.> May be, she pluck'd it off
1276   To send it me.
1277   <S {Iach}.> She writes so to you? doth shee?
1278   <S {Post}.> O no, no, no, 'tis true. Heere, take this too,
1279   It is a Basiliske vnto mine eye,
1280   Killes me to looke on't: Let there be no Honor,
1281   Where there is Beauty: Truth, where semblance: Loue,
1282   Where there's another man. The Vowes of Women,
1283   Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
1284   Then they are to their Vertues, which is nothing:
1285   O, aboue measure false.
1286   <S {Phil}.> Haue patience Sir,
1287   And take your Ring againe, 'tis not yet wonne:
1288   It may be probable she lost it: or
1289   Who knowes if one her women, being corrupted
1290   Hath stolne it from her.
1291   <S {Post}.> Very true,
1292   And so I hope he came by't: backe my Ring,
1293   Render to me some corporall signe about her
1294   More euident then this: for this was stolne.
1295   <S {Iach}.> By Iupiter, I had it from her Arme.
1296  *<S {Post}.> Hearke you, he sweares: by Iupiter he sweares.
1297   'Tis true, nay keepe the Ring; 'tis true: I am sure
1298   She would not loose it: her Attendants are
1299   All sworne, and honourable: they induc'd to steale it?
1300   And by a Stranger? No, he hath enioy'd her,
1301   The Cognisance of her incontinencie
1302  *Is this: she hath bought the name of Whore, thus deerly
1303   There, take thy hyre, and all the Fiends of #Hell
1304   Diuide themselues betweene you.
1305   <S {Phil}.> Sir, be patient:
1306   This is not strong enough to be beleeu'd
1307   Of one perswaded well of.
1308   <S {Post}.> Neuer talke on't:
1309   She hath bin colted by him.
1310   <S {Iach}.> If you seeke
1311   For further satisfying, vnder her Breast
1312   (Worthy her pressing) lyes a Mole, right proud
1313   Of that most delicate Lodging. By my life
1314   I kist it, and it gaue me present hunger
1315   To feede againe, though full. You do remember
1316   This staine vpon her?
1317   <S {Post}.> #I, and it doth confirme
1318   Another staine, as bigge as #Hell can hold,
1319   Were there no more but it.
1320   <S {Iach}.> Will you heare more?
1321   <S {Post}.> Spare your Arethmaticke,
1322   Neuer count the Turnes: Once, and a Million.
1323   <S {Iach}.> Ile be sworne.
1324   <S {Post}.> No swearing:
1325   If you will sweare you haue not done't, you lye,
1326   And I will kill thee, if thou do'st deny
1327   Thou'st made me Cuckold.
1328   <S {Iach}.> Ile deny nothing.
1329  *<S {Post}.> O that I had her heere, to teare her Limb- meale:
1330   I will go there and doo't, i'th' Court, before
1331   Her Father. Ile do something. <D {Exit}.>
1332   <S {Phil}.> Quite besides
1333   The gouernment of Patience. You haue wonne:
1334   Let's follow him, and peruert the present wrath
1335   He hath against himselfe.
1336   <S {Iach}.> With all my heart.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1337   <D {Enter Posthumus}.>
1338   <S {Post}.> Is there no way for Men to be, but Women
1339   Must be halfe- workers? We are all Bastards,
1340   And that most venerable man, which I
1341   Did call my Father, was, I know not where
1342   When I was stampt. Some Coyner with his Tooles
1343   Made me a counterfeit: yet my Mother seem'd
1344   The {Dian} of that time: so doth my Wife
1345   The Non- pareill of this. Oh Vengeance, Vengeance!
1346   Me of my lawfull pleasure she restrain'd,
1347   And pray'd me oft forbearance: did it with
1348   A pudencie so Rosie, the sweet view on't
1349   Might well haue warm'd olde Saturne;
1350   That I thought her
1351   As Chaste, as vn- Sunn'd Snow. Oh, all the Diuels!
1352   This yellow {Iachimo} in an houre, #was't not?
      <P aaa2v>
1353   Or lesse; at first? Perchance he spoke not, but
1354   Like a full Acorn'd Boare, a Iarmen #on,
1355   Cry'de #oh, and mounted; found no opposition
1356   But what he look'd for, should oppose, and she
1357   Should from encounter guard. Could I finde out
1358   The Womans part in me, for there's no motion
1359   That tends to vice in man, but I affirme
1360   It is the Womans part: be it Lying, note it,
1361   The womans: Flattering, hers; Deceiuing, hers:
1362   Lust, and ranke thoughts, hers, hers: Reuenges hers:
1363   Ambitions, Couetings, change of Prides, Disdaine,
1364   Nice- longing, Slanders, Mutability;
1365   All Faults that name, nay, that #Hell knowes,
1366  *Why hers, in part, or all: but rather all. For euen to Vice
1367   They are not constant, but are changing still;
1368   One Vice, but of a minute old, for one
1369   Not halfe so old as that. Ile write against them,
1370   Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater Skill
1371   In a true Hate, to pray they haue their #will:
1372   The very Diuels cannot plague them better.  <D {Exit}.>
1373   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1374   <D {Enter in State, Cymbeline, Queene, Clotten, and Lords at}
1375   {one doore, and at another, Caius, Lucius};
1376   {and Attendants}.>
1377  *<S {Cym}.> Now say, what would {Augustus Caesar} with vs?
1378   <S {Luc}.> When {Iulius Caesar} (whose remembrance yet
1379   Liues in mens eyes, and will to Eares and Tongues
1380   Be Theame, and hearing euer) was in this Britain,
1381   And Conquer'd it, {Cassibulan} thine Vnkle
1382   (Famous in {Caesars} prayses, no whit lesse
1383   Then in his Feats deseruing it) for him,
1384   And his Succession, granted Rome a Tribute,
1385   Yeerely three thousand pounds; which (by thee) lately
1386   Is left vntender'd.
1387   <S {Qu}.> And to kill the meruaile,
1388   Shall be so euer.
1389   <S {Clot}.> There be many {Caesars},
1390   Ere such another {Iulius}: Britaine's a world
1391   By it selfe, and we will nothing pay
1392   For wearing our owne Noses.
1393   <S {Qu}.> That opportunity
1394   Which then they had to take from's, to resume
1395   We haue againe. Remember Sir, my Liege,
1396   The Kings your Ancestors, together with
1397   The naturall brauery of your Isle, which stands
1398   As Neptunes Parke, ribb'd, and pal'd in
1399   With Oakes vnskaleable, and roaring Waters,
1400   With Sands that will not beare your Enemies Boates,
1401  *But sucke them vp to'th' Top- mast. A kinde of Conquest
1402   {Caesar} made heere, but made not heere his bragge
1403   Of Came, and Saw, and Ouer- came: with shame
1404   (The first that euer touch'd him) he was carried
1405   From off our Coast, twice beaten: and his Shipping
1406   (Poore ignorant Baubles) on our terrible Seas
1407   Like Egge- shels mou'd vpon their Surges, crack'd
1408   As easily 'gainst our Rockes. For ioy whereof,
1409   The fam'd {Cassibulan}, who was once at point
1410   (Oh giglet Fortune) to master {Caesars} Sword,
1411   Made {Luds- Towne} with reioycing- Fires bright,
1412   And Britaines strut with Courage.
1413  *<S {Clot}.> Come, there's no more Tribute to be paid: our
1414  *Kingdome is stronger then it was at that time: and (as I
1415  *said) there is no mo such {Caesars}, other of them may haue
1416   crook'd Noses, but to owe such straite Armes, none.
1417   <S {Cym}.> Son, let your Mother end.
1418  *<S {Clot}.> We haue yet many among vs, can gripe as hard
1419  *as {Cassibulan}, I doe not say I am one: but I haue a hand.
1420  *Why Tribute? Why should we pay Tribute? If {Caesar}
1421  *can hide the Sun from vs with a Blanket, or put the Moon
1422  *in his pocket, we will pay him Tribute for light: else Sir,
1423   no more Tribute, pray you now.
1424   <S {Cym}.> You must know,
1425   Till the iniurious Romans, did extort
1426   This Tribute from vs, we were free. {Caesars} Ambition,
1427   Which swell'd so much, that it did almost stretch
1428   The sides o'th' World, against all colour heere,
1429   Did put the yoake vpon's; which to shake off
1430   Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
1431   Our selues to be, we do. Say then to {Caesar},
1432   Our Ancestor was that {Mulmutius}, which
1433   Ordain'd our Lawes, whose vse the Sword of {Caesar}
1434  *Hath too much mangled; whose repayre, and franchise,
1435   Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,
1436  *Tho Rome be therfore angry. {Mulmutius} made our lawes
1437   Who was the first of Britaine, which did put
1438   His browes within a golden Crowne, and call'd
1439   Himselfe a King.
1440   <S {Luc}.> I am sorry {Cymbeline},
1441   That I am to pronounce {Augustus Caesar}
1442   ({Caesar}, that hath moe Kings his Seruants, then
1443   Thy selfe Domesticke Officers) thine Enemy:
1444   Receyue it from me then. Warre, and Confusion
1445   In {Caesars} name pronounce I 'gainst thee: Looke
1446   For fury, not to be resisted. Thus defide,
1447   I thanke thee for my selfe.
1448   <S {Cym}.> Thou art welcome {Caius},
1449   Thy {Caesar} Knighted me; my youth I spent
1450   Much vnder him; of him, I gather'd Honour,
1451   Which he, to seeke of me againe, perforce,
1452   Behooues me keepe at vtterance. I am perfect,
1453   That the Pannonians and Dalmatians, for
1454   Their Liberties are now in Armes: a President
1455   Which not to reade, would shew the Britaines cold:
1456   So {Caesar} shall not finde them.
1457   <S {Luc}.> Let proofe speake.
1458  *<S {Clot}.> His Maiesty biddes you welcome. Make pa-stime
1459  *with vs, a day, or two, or longer: if you seek vs af-terwards
1460  *in other tearmes, you shall finde vs in our Salt-water- Girdle:
1461  *if you beate vs out of it, it is yours: if you
1462  *fall in the aduenture, our Crowes shall fare the better for
1463   you: and there's an end.
1464   <S {Luc}.> So sir.
1465   <S {Cym}.> I know your Masters pleasure, and he mine:
1466   All the Remaine, is welcome.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1467   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1468   <D {Enter Pisanio reading of a Letter}.>
1469   <S {Pis}.> How? of Adultery? Wherefore write you not
1470   What Monsters her accuse? {Leonatus}:
1471   Oh Master, what a strange infection
      <P aaa3><C E>
1472   Is falne into thy eare? What false Italian,
1473   (As poysonous tongu'd, as handed) hath preuail'd
1474   On thy too ready hearing? Disloyall? No.
1475   She's punish'd for her Truth; and vndergoes
1476   More Goddesse- like, then Wife- like; such Assaults
1477   As would take in some Vertue. Oh my Master,
1478   Thy mind to her, is now as lowe, as were
1479   Thy Fortunes. How? That I should murther her,
1480   Vpon the Loue, and Truth, and Vowes; which I
1481   Haue made to thy command? I her? Her blood?
1482   If it be so, to do good seruice, neuer
1483   Let me be counted seruiceable. How looke I,
1484   That I should seeme to lacke humanity,
1485   So much as this Fact comes to? Doo't: The Letter.
1486   {That I haue sent her, by her owne command},
1487   {Shall giue thee opportunitie}. Oh damn'd paper,
1488   Blacke as the Inke that's on thee: senselesse bauble,
1489   Art thou a Foedarie for this Act; and look'st
1490   So Virgin- like without? Loe here she comes.
1491   <D {Enter Imogen}.>
1492   I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
1493   <S {Imo}.> How now {Pisanio}?
1494   <S {Pis}.> Madam, heere is a Letter from my Lord.
1495   <S {Imo}.> Who, thy Lord? That is my Lord {Leonatus}?
1496   Oh, learn'd indeed were that Astronomer
1497   That knew the Starres, as I his Characters,
1498   Heel'd lay the Future open. You good Gods,
1499   Let what is heere contain'd, rellish of Loue,
1500   Of my Lords health, of his content: yet not
1501   That we two are asunder, let that grieue him;
1502   Some griefes are medcinable, that is one of them,
1503   For it doth physicke Loue, of his content,
1504   All but in that. Good Wax, thy leaue: blest be
1505  *You Bees that make these Lockes of counsaile. Louers,
1506   And men in dangerous Bondes pray not alike,
1507   Though Forfeytours you cast in prison, yet

1514  *{all happinesse, that remaines loyall to his Vow, and your encrea-sing}
1515   {in Loue}.  Leonatus Posthumus.
1516   Oh for a Horse with wings: Hear'st thou {Pisanio}?
1517   He is at Milford- Hauen: Read, and tell me
1518   How farre 'tis thither. If one of meane affaires
1519   May plod it in a weeke, why may not I
1520   Glide thither in a day? Then true {Pisanio},
1521   Who long'st like me, to see thy Lord; who long'st
1522   (Oh let me bate) but not like me: yet long'st
1523   But in a fainter kinde. Oh not like me:
1524   For mine's beyond, beyond: say, and speake thicke
1525   (Loues Counsailor should fill the bores of hearing,
1526   To'th' smothering of the Sense) how farre it is
1527   To this same blessed Milford. And by'th' way
1528   Tell me how Wales was made so happy, as
1529   T' inherite such a Hauen. But first of all,
1530   How we may steale from hence: and for the gap
1531   That we shall make in Time, from our hence- going,
1532   And our returne, to excuse: but first, how get hence.
1533   Why should excuse be borne or ere begot?
1534   Weele talke of that heereafter. Prythee speake,
1535   How many store of Miles may we well rid
1536   Twixt houre, and houre?
1537   <S {Pis}.> One score 'twixt Sun, and Sun,
1538   Madam's enough for you: and too much too.
1539   <S {Imo}.> Why, one that rode to's Execution Man,
1540  *Could neuer go so slow: I haue heard of Riding wagers,
1541   Where Horses haue bin nimbler then the Sands
1542   That run i'th' Clocks behalfe. But this is Foolrie,
1543   Go, bid my Woman faigne a Sicknesse, say
1544   She'le home to her Father; and prouide me presently
1545   A Riding Suit: No costlier then would fit
1546   A Franklins Huswife.
1547   <S {Pisa}.> Madam, you're best consider.
1548   <S {Imo}.> I see before me (Man) nor heere, nor heere;
1549   Nor what ensues but haue a Fog in them
1550   That I cannot looke through. Away, I prythee,
1551   Do as I bid thee: There's no more to say:
1552   Accessible is none but Milford way.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1553   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
1554   <D {Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Aruiragus}.>
1555   <S {Bel}.> A goodly day, not to keepe house with such,
1556  *Whose Roofe's as lowe as ours: Sleepe Boyes, this gate
1557  *Instructs you how t' adore the Heauens; and bowes you
1558   To a mornings holy office. The Gates of Monarches
1559   Are Arch'd so high, that Giants may iet through
1560   And keepe their impious Turbonds on, without
1561   Good morrow to the Sun. Haile thou faire Heauen,
1562   We house i'th' Rocke, yet vse thee not so hardly
1563   As prouder liuers do.
1564   <S {Guid}.> Haile Heauen.
1565   <S {Aruir}.> Haile Heauen.
1566  *<S {Bela}.> Now for our Mountaine sport, vp to yond hill
1567   Your legges are yong: Ile tread these Flats. Consider,
1568   When you aboue perceiue me like a Crow,
1569   That it is Place, which lessen's, and sets off,
1570   And you may then reuolue what Tales, I haue told you,
1571   Of Courts, of Princes; of the Tricks in Warre.
1572   This Seruice, is not Seruice; so being done,
1573   But being so allowed. To apprehend thus,
1574   Drawes vs a profit from all things we see:
1575   And often to our comfort, shall we finde
1576   The sharded- Beetle, in a safer hold
1577   Then is the full- wing'd Eagle. Oh this life,
1578   Is Nobler, then attending for a checke:
1579   Richer, then doing nothing for a Babe:
1580   Prouder, then rustling in vnpayd- for Silke:
1581   Such gaine the Cap of him, that makes him fine,
1582   Yet keepes his Booke vncros'd: no life to ours.
1583  *<S {Gui}.> Out of your proofe you speak: we poore vnfledg'd
1584  *Haue neuer wing'd from view o'th' nest; nor knowes not
1585   What Ayre's from home. Hap'ly this life is best,
1586   (If quiet life be best) sweeter to you
1587   That haue a sharper knowne. Well corresponding
1588   With your stiffe Age; but vnto vs, it is
1589   A Cell of Ignorance: trauailing #a bed,
1590   A Prison, or a Debtor, that not dares
1591   To stride a limit.
1592   <S {Arui}.> What should we speake of
1593   When we are old as you? When we shall heare
1594   The Raine and winde beate darke December? How
1595   In this our pinching Caue, shall we discourse
      <P aaa3v><C B>
1596   The freezing houres away? We haue seene nothing:
1597   We are beastly; subtle as the Fox for prey,
1598   Like warlike as the Wolfe, for what we eate:
1599   Our Valour is to chace what flyes: Our Cage
1600   We make a Quire, as doth the prison'd Bird,
1601   And sing our Bondage freely.
1602   <S {Bel}.> How you speake.
1603   Did you but know the Citties Vsuries,
1604   And felt them knowingly: the #Art o'th' Court,
1605   As hard to leaue, as keepe: whose top to climbe
1606   Is certaine falling: or so slipp'ry, that
1607   The feare's as bad as falling. The toyle o'th' Warre,
1608   A paine that onely seemes to seeke out danger
1609   I'th' name of Fame, and Honor, which dyes i'th' search,
1610   And hath as oft a sland'rous Epitaph,
1611   As Record of faire Act. Nay, many times
1612   Doth #ill deserue, by doing well: what's worse
1613   Must curt'sie at the Censure. Oh Boyes, this Storie
1614   The World may reade in me: My bodie's mark'd
1615   With Roman Swords; and my report, was once
1616   First, with the best of Note. {Cymbeline} lou'd me,
1617   And when a Souldier was the Theame, my name
1618   Was not farre off: then was I as a Tree
1619  *Whose boughes did bend with fruit. But in one night,
1620   A Storme, or Robbery (call it what you will)
1621   Shooke downe my mellow hangings: nay my Leaues,
1622   And left me bare to weather.
1623   <S {Gui}.> Vncertaine fauour.
1624  *<S {Bel}.> My fault being nothing (as I haue told you oft)
1625   But that two Villaines, whose false Oathes preuayl'd
1626   Before my perfect Honor, swore to {Cymbeline},
1627   I was Confederate with the Romanes: so
1628   Followed my Banishment, and this twenty yeeres,
1629  *This Rocke, and these Demesnes, haue bene my World,
1630   Where I haue liu'd at honest freedome, payed
1631   More pious debts to Heauen, then in all
1632   The fore- end of my time. But, vp to'th' Mountaines,
1633   This is not Hunters Language; he that strikes
1634   The Venison first, shall be the Lord o'th' Feast,
1635   To him the other two shall minister,
1636   And we will feare no poyson, which attends
1637   In place of greater State:
1638   Ile meete you in the Valleyes.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1639   How hard it is to hide the sparkes of Nature?
1640   These Boyes know little they are Sonnes to'th' King,
1641   Nor {Cymbeline} dreames that they are aliue.
1642   They thinke they are mine,
1643   And though train'd vp thus meanely
1644   I'th' Caue, whereon the Bowe their thoughts do hit,
1645   The Roofes of Palaces, and Nature prompts them
1646   In simple and lowe things, to Prince it, much
1647   Beyond the tricke of others. This {Paladour},
1648   The heyre of {Cymbeline} and Britaine, who
1649   The King his Father call'd {Guiderius}. Ioue,
1650   When on my three- foot stoole I sit, and tell
1651   The warlike feats I haue done, his spirits flye out
1652   Into my Story: say thus mine Enemy fell,
1653   And thus I set my foote on's necke, euen then
1654   The Princely blood flowes in his Cheeke, he sweats,
1655   Straines his yong Nerues, and puts himselfe in posture
1656   That acts my words. The yonger Brother {Cadwall},
1657   Once {Aruiragus}, in as like a figure
1658   Strikes life into my speech, and shewes much more
1659   His owne conceyuing. Hearke, the Game is rows'd,
1660   Oh {Cymbeline}, Heauen and my Conscience knowes
1661   Thou didd'st vniustly banish me: whereon
1662   At three, and two yeeres old, I stole these Babes,
1663   Thinking to barre thee of Succession, as
1664   Thou refts me of my Lands. {Euriphile},
1665  *Thou was't their Nurse, they took thee for their mother,
1666   And euery day do honor to her graue:
1667   My selfe {Belarius}, that am {Mergan} call'd
1668   They take for Naturall Father. The Game is vp.  <D {Exit}.>
1669   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1670   <D {Enter Pisanio and Imogen}.>
1671  *<S {Imo}.> Thou told'st me when we came fro[m] horse, y place
1672   Was neere at hand: Ne're long'd my Mother so
1673   To see me first, as I haue now. {Pisanio}, Man:
1674   Where is {Posthumus}? What is in thy mind
1675  *That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
1676   From th' inward of thee? One, but painted thus
1677   Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
1678   Beyond selfe- explication. Put thy selfe
1679   Into a hauiour of lesse feare, ere wildnesse
1680   Vanquish my stayder Senses. What's the matter?
1681   Why render'st thou that Paper to me, with
1682   A looke vntender? If't be Summer Newes
1683   Smile too't before: if Winterly, thou need'st
1684   But keepe that count'nance stil. My Husbands hand?
1685   That Drug- damn'd Italy, hath out- craftied him,
1686  *And hee's at some hard point. Speake man, thy Tongue
1687   May take off some extreamitie, which to reade
1688   Would be euen mortall to me.
1689   <S {Pis}.> Please you reade,
1690   And you shall finde me (wretched man) a thing
1691   The most disdain'd of Fortune.
1692   <S {Imogen reades}.>
1693  *{Thy Mistris (Pisanio) hath plaide the Strumpet in my}
1694  *{Bed: the Testimonies whereof, lyes bleeding in me. I speak}
1695  *{not out of weake Surmises, but from proofe as strong as my}
1696  *{greefe, and as certaine as I expect my Reuenge. That part, thou}
1697  *({Pisanio) must acte for me, if thy Faith be not tainted with the}
1698  *{breach of hers; let thine owne hands take away her life: I shall}
1699  *{giue thee opportunity at Milford Hauen. She hath my Letter}
1700  *{for the purpose; where, if thou feare to strike, and to make mee}
1701  *{certaine it is done, thou art the Pander to her dishonour, and}
1702   {equally to me disloyall}.
1703   <S {Pis}.> What shall I need to draw my Sword, the Paper
1704   Hath cut her throat alreadie? No, 'tis Slander,
1705   Whose edge is sharper then the Sword, whose tongue
1706   Out- venomes all the Wormes of Nyle, whose breath
1707   Rides on the posting windes, and doth belye
1708   All corners of the World. Kings, Queenes, and States,
1709   Maides, Matrons, nay the Secrets of the Graue
1710   This viperous slander enters. What cheere, Madam?
1711   <S {Imo}.> False to his Bed? What is it to be false?
1712   To lye in watch there, and to thinke on him?
1713  *To weepe 'twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge Nature,
1714   To breake it with a fearfull dreame of him,
1715   And cry my selfe awake? That's false to's bed? Is it?
1716   <S {Pisa}.> Alas good Lady.
1717   <S {Imo}.> I false? Thy Conscience witnesse: {Iachimo},
1718   Thou didd'st accuse him of Incontinencie,
1719   Thou then look'dst like a Villaine: now, me thinkes
      <P aaa4>
1720   Thy fauours good enough. Some Iay of Italy
1721   (Whose mother was her painting) hath betraid him:
1722   Poore I am stale, a Garment out of fashion,
1723   And for I am richer then to hang by th' walles,
1724   I must be ript: To peeces with me: Oh!
1725   Mens Vowes are womens Traitors. All good seeming
1726   By thy reuolt (oh Husband) shall be thought
1727   Put on for Villainy; not borne where't growes,
1728   But worne a Baite for Ladies.
1729   <S {Pisa}.> Good Madam, heare me.
1730  *<S {Imo}.> True honest men being heard, like false {Aeneas},
1731   Were in his time thought false: and {Synons} weeping
1732   Did scandall many a holy teare: tooke pitty
1733   From most true wretchednesse. So thou, {Posthumus}
1734   Wilt lay the Leauen on all proper men;
1735   Goodly, and gallant, shall be false and periur'd
1736   From thy great faile: Come Fellow, be thou honest,
1737   Do thou thy Masters bidding. When thou seest him,
1738   A little witnesse my obedience. Looke
1739   I draw the Sword my selfe, take it, and hit
1740   The innocent Mansion of my Loue (my Heart:)
1741   Feare not, 'tis empty of all things, but Greefe:
1742   Thy Master is not there, who was indeede
1743   The riches of it. Do his bidding, strike,
1744   Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
1745   But now thou seem'st a Coward.
1746   <S {Pis}.> Hence vile Instrument,
1747   Thou shalt not damne my hand.
1748   <S {Imo}.> Why, I must dye:
1749   And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
1750   No Seruant of thy Masters. Against Selfe- slaughter,
1751   There is a prohibition so Diuine,
1752  *That crauens my weake hand: Come, heere's my heart:
1753   Something's a- foot: Soft, soft, wee'l no defence,
1754   Obedient as the Scabbard. What is heere,
1755   The Scriptures of the Loyall {Leonatus},
1756   All turn'd to Heresie? Away, away
1757   Corrupters of my Faith, you shall no more
1758   Be Stomachers to my heart: thus may pooru Fooles
1759   Beleeue false Teachers: Though those that are betraid
1760   Do feele the Treason sharpely, yet the Traitor
1761   Stands in worse case of woe. And thou {Posthumus},
1762   That didd'st set vp my disobedience 'gainst the King
1763   My Father, and makes me put into contempt the suites
1764   Of Princely Fellowes, shalt heereafter finde
1765   It is no acte of common passage, but
1766   A straine of Rarenesse: and I greeue my selfe,
1767   To thinke, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her,
1768   That now thou tyrest on, how thy memory
1769   Will then be pang'd by me. Prythee dispatch,
1770   The Lambe entreats the Butcher. Wher's thy knife?
1771   Thou art too slow to do thy Masters bidding
1772   When I desire it too.
1773   <S {Pis}.> Oh gracious Lady:
1774   Since I receiu'd command to do this businesse,
1775   I haue not slept one winke.
1776   <S {Imo}.> Doo't, and to bed then.
1777   <S {Pis}.> Ile wake mine eye- balles first.
1778   <S {Imo}.> Wherefore then
1779   Didd'st vndertake it? Why hast thou abus'd
1780   So many Miles, with a pretence? This place?
1781   Mine Action? and thine owne? Our Horses labour?
1782   The Time inuiting thee? The perturb'd Court
1783   For my being absent? whereunto I neuer
1784   Purpose returne. Why hast thou gone so farre
1785   To be vn- bent? when thou hast 'tane thy stand,
1786   Th' elected Deere before thee?
1787   <S {Pis}.> But to win time
1788   To loose so bad employment, in the which
1789   I haue consider'd of a course: good Ladie
1790   Heare me with patience.
1791   <S {Imo}.> Talke thy tongue weary, speake:
1792   I haue heard I am a Strumpet, and mine eare
1793   Therein false strooke, can take no greater wound,
1794   Nor tent, to bottome that. But speake.
1795   <S {Pis}.> Then Madam,
1796   I thought you would not backe againe.
1797   <S {Imo}.> Most like,
1798   Bringing me heere to kill me.
1799   <S {Pis}.> Not so neither:
1800   But if I were as wise, as honest, then
1801   My purpose would proue well: it cannot be,
1802   But that my Master is abus'd. Some Villaine,
1803   #I, and singular in his #Art, hath done you both
1804   This cursed iniurie.
1805   <S {Imo}.> Some Roman Curtezan?
1806   <S {Pisa}.> No, on my life:
1807   Ile giue but notice you are dead, and send him
1808   Some bloody signe of it. For 'tis commanded
1809   I should do so: you shall be mist at Court,
1810   And that will well confirme it.
1811   <S {Imo}.> Why good Fellow,
1812   What shall I do the while? Where bide? How liue?
1813   Or in my life, what comfort, when I am
1814   Dead to my Husband?
1815   <S {Pis}.> If you'l backe to'th' Court.
1816   <S {Imo}.> No Court, no Father, nor no more adoe
1817   With that harsh, noble, simple nothing:
1818   That {Clotten}, whose Loue- suite hath bene to me
1819   As fearefull as a Siege.
1820   <S {Pis}.> If not at Court,
1821   Then not in Britaine must you bide.
1822   <S {Imo}.> Where then?
1823   Hath Britaine all the Sunne that shines? Day? Night?
1824   Are they not but in Britaine? I'th' worlds Volume
1825   Our Britaine seemes as of it, but not in't:
1826   In a great Poole, a Swannes- nest, prythee thinke
1827   There's liuers out of Britaine.
1828   <S {Pis}.> I am most glad
1829   You thinke of other place: Th' Ambassador,
1830   {Lucius} the Romane comes to Milford- Hauen
1831   To morrow. Now, if you could weare a minde
1832   Darke, as your Fortune is, and but disguise
1833   That which t' appeare it selfe, must not yet be,
1834   But by selfe- danger, you should tread a course
1835   Pretty, and full of view: yea, happily, neere
1836   The residence of {Posthumus}; so nie (at least)
1837   That though his Actions were not visible, yut
1838   Report should render him hourely to your eare,
1839   As truely as he mooues.
1840   <S {Imo}.> Oh for such meanes,
1841   Though perill to my modestie, not death on't
1842   I would aduenture.
1843   <S {Pis}.> Well then, heere's the point:
1844   You must forget to be a Woman: change
1845   Command, into obedience. Feare, and Nicenesse
1846   (The Handmaides of all Women, or more truely
1847   Woman #it pretty selfe) into a waggish courage,
1848   Ready in gybes, quicke- answer'd, sawcie, and
1849   As quarrellous as the Weazell: Nay, you must
1850   Forget that rarest Treasure of your Cheeke,
1851   Exposing it (but oh the harder heart,
      <P aaa4v>
1852   Alacke no remedy) to the greedy touch
1853   Of common- kissing {Titan}: and forget
1854   Your laboursome and dainty Trimmes, wherein
1855   You made great {Iuno} angry.
1856   <S {Imo}.> Nay be breefe?
1857   I see into thy end, and am almost
1858   A man already.
1859   <S {Pis}.> First, make your selfe but like one,
1860   Fore- thinking this. I haue already fit
1861   ('Tis in my Cloake- bagge) Doublet, Hat, Hose, all
1862   That answer to them: Would you in their seruing,
1863   (And with what imitation you can borrow
1864   From youth of such a season) 'fore Noble {Lucius}
1865   Present your selfe, desire his seruice: tell him
1866   Wherein you're happy; which will make him know,
1867   If that his head haue eare in Musicke, doubtlesse
1868   With ioy he will imbrace you: for hee's Honourable,
1869   And doubling that, most holy. Your meanes abroad:
1870   You haue me rich, and I will neuer faile
1871   Beginning, nor supplyment.
1872   <S {Imo}.> Thou art all the comfort
1873   The Gods will diet me with. Prythee away,
1874   There's more to be consider'd: but wee'l euen
1875   All that good time will giue vs. This attempt,
1876   I am Souldier #too, and will abide it with
1877   A Princes Courage. Away, I prythee.
1878   <S {Pis}.> Well Madam, we must take a short farewell,
1879   Least being mist, I be suspected of
1880   Your carriage from the Court. My Noble Mistris,
1881   Heere is a boxe, I had it from the Queene,
1882   What's in't is precious: If you are sicke at Sea,
1883   Or Stomacke- qualm'd at Land, a Dramme of this
1884   Will driue away distemper. To some shade,
1885   And fit you to your Manhood: may the Gods
1886   Direct you to the best.
1887   <S {Imo}.> Amen: I thanke thee.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1888   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
1889   <D {Enter Cymbeline, Queene, Cloten, Lucius},
1890   {and Lords}.>
1891   <S {Cym}.> Thus farre, and so farewell.
1892   <S {Luc}.> Thankes, Royall Sir:
1893   My Emperor hath wrote, I must from hence,
1894   And am right sorry, that I must report ye
1895   My Masters Enemy.
1896   <S {Cym}.> Our Subiects (Sir)
1897   Will not endure his yoake; and for our selfe
1898   To shew lesse Soueraignty then they, must needs
1899   Appeare vn- Kinglike.
1900   <S {Luc}.> So Sir: I desire of you
1901   A Conduct ouer Land, to Milford- Hauen.
1902   Madam, all ioy befall your Grace, and you.
1903  *<S {Cym}.> My Lords, you are appointed for that Office:
1904   The due of Honor, in no point omit:
1905   So farewell Noble {Lucius}.
1906   <S {Luc}.> Your hand, my Lord.
1907   <S {Clot}.> Receiue it friendly: but from this time forth
1908   I weare it as your Enemy.
1909   <S {Luc}.> Sir, the Euent
1910   Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.
1911   <S {Cym}.> Leaue not the worthy {Lucius}, good my Lords
1912  *Till he haue crost the Seuern. Happines.  <D {Exit Lucius, &c}>
1913   <S {Qu}.> He goes hence frowning: but it honours vs
1914   That we haue giuen him cause.
1915   <S {Clot}.> 'Tis all the better,
1916   Your valiant Britaines haue their wishes in it.
1917   <S {Cym}.> {Lucius} hath wrote already to the Emperor
1918   How it goes heere. It fits vs therefore ripely
1919   Our Chariots, and our Horsemen be in readinesse:
1920   The Powres that he already hath in Gallia
1921   Will soone be drawne to head, from whence he moues
1922   His warre for Britaine.
1923   <S {Qu}.> 'Tis not sleepy businesse,
1924   But must be look'd #too speedily, and strongly.
1925   <S {Cym}.> Our expectation that it would be thus
1926   Hath made vs forward. But my gentle Queene,
1927   Where is our Daughter? She hath not appear'd
1928   Before the Roman, nor to vs hath tender'd
1929   The duty of the day. She looke vs like
1930   A thing more made of malice, then of duty,
1931   We haue noted it. Call her before vs, for
1932   We haue beene too slight in sufferance.
1933   <S {Qu}.> Royall Sir,
1934   Since the exile of {Posthumus}, most retyr'd
1935   Hath her life bin: the Cure whereof, my Lord,
1936   'Tis time must do. Beseech your Maiesty,
1937   Forbeare sharpe speeches to her. Shee's a Lady
1938   So tender of rebukes, that words are stroke;
1939   And strokes death to her.
1940   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1941   <S {Cym}.> Where is she Sir? How
1942   Can her contempt be answer'd?
1943   <S {Mes}.> Please you Sir,
1944   Her Chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer
1945   That will be giuen to'th' lowd of noise, we make.
1946   <S {Qu}.> My Lord, when last I went to visit her,
1947   She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
1948   Whereto constrain'd by her infirmitie,
1949   She should that dutie leaue vnpaide to you
1950   Which dayly she was bound to proffer: this
1951   She wish'd me to make knowne: but our great Court
1952   Made me #too blame in memory.
1953   <S {Cym}.> Her doores lock'd?
1954   Not seene of late? Grant Heauens, that which I
1955   Feare, proue false.  <D {Exit}.>
1956   <S {Qu}.> Sonne, I say, follow the King.
1957   <S {Clot}.> That man of hers, {Pisanio}, her old Seruant
1958   I haue not seene these two dayes.  <D {Exit}.>
1959   <S {Qu}.> Go, looke after:
1960   {Pisanio}, thou that stand'st so for {Posthumus},
1961   He hath a Drugge of mine: I pray, his absence
1962   Proceed by swallowing that. For he beleeues
1963   It is a thing most precious. But for her,
1964   Where is she gone? Haply dispaire hath seiz'd her:
1965   Or wing'd with feruour of her loue, she's flowne
1966   To her desir'd {Posthumus}: gone she is,
1967   To death, or to dishonor, and my end
1968   Can make good vse of either. Shee being downe,
1969   I haue the placing of the Brittish Crowne.
1970   <D {Enter Cloten}.>
1971   How now, my Sonne?
1972   <S {Clot}.> 'Tis certaine she is fled:
1973   Go in and cheere the King, he rages, none
1974   Dare come about him.
1975   <S {Qu}.> All the better: may
1976  *This night fore- stall him of the comming day.  <D {Exit Qu}.>
1977   <S {Clo}.> I loue, and hate her: for she's Faire and Royall,
1978   And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
      <P aaa5>
1979   Then Lady, Ladies, Woman, from euery one
1980   The best she hath, and she of all compounded
1981   Out- selles them all. I loue her therefore, but
1982   Disdaining me, and throwing Fauours on
1983   The low {Posthumus}, slanders so her iudgement,
1984   That what's else rare, is choak'd: and in that point
1985   I will conclude to hate her, nay indeede,
1986   To be reueng'd vpon her. For, when Fooles shall===
1987   <D {Enter Pisanio}.>
1988   Who is heere? What, are you packing sirrah?
1989   Come hither: Ah you precious Pandar, Villaine,
1990   Where is thy Lady? In a word, or else
1991   Thou art straightway with the Fiends.
1992   <S {Pis}.> Oh, good my Lord.
1993   <S {Clo}.> Where is thy Lady? Or, by Iupiter,
1994   I will not aske againe. Close Villaine,
1995   Ile haue this Secret from thy heart, or rip
1996   Thy heart to finde it. Is she with {Posthumus}?
1997   From whose so many waights of basenesse, cannot
1998   A dram of worth be drawne.
1999   <S {Pis}.> Alas, nay Lord,
2000   How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?
2001   He is in Rome.
2002   <S {Clot}.> Where is she Sir? Come neerer:
2003   No farther halting: satisfie me home,
2004   What is become of her?
2005   <S {Pis}.> Oh, my all- worthy Lord.
2006   <S {Clo}.> All- worthy Villaine,
2007   Discouer where thy Mistris is, at once,
2008   At the next word: no more of worthy Lord:
2009   Speake, or thy silence on the instant, is
2010   Thy condemnation, and thy death.
2011   <S {Pis}.> Then Sir:
2012   This Paper is the historie of my knowledge
2013   Touching her flight.
2014   <S {Clo}.> Let's see't: I will pursue her
2015   Euen to {Augustus} Throne.
2016   <S {Pis}.> Or this, or perish.
2017   She's farre enough, and what he learnes by this,
2018   May proue his trauell, not her danger.
2019   <S {Clo}.> Humh.
2020   <S {Pis}.> Ile write to my Lord she's dead: Oh {Imogen},
2021   Safe mayst thou wander, safe returne agen.
2022   <S {Clot}.> Sirra, is this Letter true?
2023   <S {Pis}.> Sir, as I thinke.
2024  *<S {Clot}.> It is {Posthumus} hand, I know't. Sirrah, if thou
2025  *would'st not be a Villain, but do me true seruice: vnder-go
2026  *those Imployments wherin I should haue cause to vse
2027  *thee with a serious industry, that is, what villainy soere I
2028  *bid thee do to performe it, directly and truely, I would
2029  *thinke thee an honest man: thou should'st neither want
2030  *my meanes for thy releefe, nor my voyce for thy prefer-ment.
2031  _
2032   <S {Pis}.> Well, my good Lord.
2033  *<S {Clot}.> Wilt thou serue mee? For since patiently and
2034  *constantly thou hast stucke to the bare Fortune of that
2035  *Begger {Posthumus}, thou canst not in the course of grati-tude,
2036  *but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serue
2037   mee?
2038   <S {Pis}.> Sir, I will.
2039  *<S {Clo}.> Giue mee thy hand, heere's my purse. Hast any
2040   of thy late Masters Garments in thy possession?
2041  *<S {Pisan}.> I haue (my Lord) at my Lodging, the same
2042  *Suite he wore, when he tooke leaue of my Ladie & Mi-stresse.
2043  _
2044  *<S {Clo}.> The first seruice thou dost mee, fetch that Suite
2045   hither, let it be thy first seruice, go.
2046   <S {Pis}.> I shall my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
2047  *<S {Clo}.> Meet thee at Milford- Hauen: (I forgot to aske
2048  *him one thing, Ile remember't anon:) euen there, thou
2049  *villaine {Posthumus} will I kill thee. I would these Gar-ments
2050  *were come. She saide vpon a time (the bitternesse
2051  *of it, I now belch from my heart) that shee held the very
2052  *Garment of {Posthumus}, in more respect, then my Noble
2053  *and naturall person; together with the adornement of
2054  *my Qualities. With that Suite vpon my backe wil I ra-uish
2055  *her: first kill him, and in her eyes; there shall she see
2056  *my valour, which wil then be a torment to hir contempt.
2057  *He on the ground, my speech of insulment ended on his
2058  *dead bodie, and when my Lust hath dined (which, as I
2059  *say, to vex her, I will execute in the Cloathes that she so
2060  *prais'd:) to the Court Ile knock her backe, foot her home
2061  *againe. She hath despis'd mee reioycingly, and Ile bee
2062   merry in my Reuenge.
2063   <D {Enter Pisanio}.>
2064   Be those the Garments?
2065   <S {Pis}.> #I, my Noble Lord.
2066  *<S {Clo}.> How long is't since she went to Milford- Hauen?
2067   <S {Pis}.> She can scarse be there yet.
2068  *<S {Clo}.> Bring this Apparrell to my Chamber, that is
2069  *the second thing that I haue commanded thee. The third
2070  *is, that thou wilt be a voluntarie Mute to my designe. Be
2071  *but dutious, and true preferment shall tender it selfe to
2072  *thee. My Reuenge is now at Milford, would I had wings
2073   to follow it. Come, and be true.  <D {Exit}>
2074   <S {Pis}.> Thou bid'st me to my losse: for true to thee,
2075   Were to proue false, which I will neuer bee
2076   To him that is most true. To Milford go,
2077   And finde not her, whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow
2078   You Heauenly blessings on her: This Fooles speede
2079   Be crost with slownesse; Labour be his meede.  <D {Exit}>
2080   <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
2081   <D {Enter Imogen alone}.>
2082   <S {Imo}.> I see a mans life is a tedious one,
2083   I haue tyr'd my selfe: and for two nights together
2084   Haue made the ground my bed. I should be sicke,
2085   But that my resolution helpes me: Milford,
2086   When from the Mountaine top, {Pisanio} shew'd thee,
2087   Thou was't within a kenne. Oh Ioue, I thinke
2088   Foundations flye the wretched: such I meane,
2089  *Where they should be releeu'd. Two Beggers told me,
2090   I could not misse my way. Will poore Folkes lye
2091   That haue Afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
2092   A punishment, or Triall? Yes; no wonder,
2093   When Rich- ones scarse tell true. To lapse in Fulnesse
2094   Is sorer, then to lye for Neede: and Falshood
2095   Is worse in Kings, then Beggers. My deere Lord,
2096   Thou art one o'th' false Ones: Now I thinke on thee,
2097   My hunger's gone; but euen before, I was
2098   At point to sinke, for Food. But what is this?
2099   Heere is a path too't: 'tis some sauage hold:
2100   I were best not call; I dare not call: yet Famine
2101   Ere cleane it o're- throw Nature, makes it valiant.
2102   Plentie, and Peace breeds Cowards: Hardnesse euer
2103   Of Hardinesse is Mother. Hoa? who's heere?
2104   If any thing that's ciuill, speake: if sauage,
      <P aaa5v>
2105   Take, or lend. Hoa? No answer? Then Ile enter.
2106   Best draw my Sword; and if mine Enemy
2107   But feare the Sword like me, hee'l scarsely looke on't.
2108   Such a Foe, good Heauens.  <D {Exit}.>
2109   <Z {Scena Septima}.>
2110   <D {Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Aruiragus}.>
2111   <S {Bel}.> You {Polidore} haue prou'd best Woodman, and
2112   Are Master of the Feast: {Cadwall}, and I
2113   Will play the Cooke, and Seruant, 'tis our match:
2114   The sweat of industry would dry, and dye
2115   But for the end it workes #too. Come, our stomackes
2116   Will make what's homely, sauoury: Wearinesse
2117   Can snore vpon the Flint, when restie Sloth
2118   Findes the Downe- pillow hard. Now peace be heere,
2119   Poore house, that keep'st thy selfe.
2120   <S {Gui}.> I am throughly weary.
2121  *<S {Arui}.> I am weake with toyle, yet strong in appetite.
2122  *<S {Gui}.> There is cold meat i'th' Caue, #we'l brouz on that
2123   Whil'st what we haue kill'd, be Cook'd.
2124   <S {Bel}.> Stay, come not in:
2125   But that it eates our victualles, I should thinke
2126   Heere were a Faiery.
2127   <S {Gui}.> What's the matter, Sir?
2128   <S {Bel}.> By Iupiter an Angell: or if not
2129   An earthly Paragon. Behold Diuinenesse
2130   No elder then a Boy.
2131   <D {Enter Imogen}.>
2132   <S {Imo}.> Good masters harme me not:
2133   Before I enter'd heere, I call'd, and thought
2134  *To haue begg'd, or bought, what I haue took: good troth
2135  *I haue stolne nought, nor would not, though I had found
2136  *Gold strew'd i'th' Floore. Heere's money for my Meate,
2137   I would haue left it on the Boord, so soone
2138   As I had made my Meale; and parted
2139   With Pray'rs for the Prouider.
2140   <S {Gui}.> Money? Youth.
2141   <S {Aru}.> All Gold and Siluer rather turne to durt,
2142   As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
2143   Who worship durty Gods.
2144   <S {Imo}.> I see you're angry:
2145   Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
2146   Haue dyed, had I not made it.
2147   <S {Bel}.> Whether bound?
2148   <S {Imo}.> To Milford- Hauen.
2149   <S {Bel}.> What's your name?
2150   <S {Imo}.> {Fidele} Sir: I haue a Kinsman, who
2151   Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford,
2152   To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
2153   I am falne in this offence.
2154   <S {Bel}.> Prythee (faire youth)
2155   Thinke vs no Churles: nor measure our good mindes
2156   By this rude place we liue in. Well encounter'd,
2157   'Tis almost night, you shall haue better cheere
2158   Ere you depart; and thankes to stay, and eate it:
2159   Boyes, bid him welcome.
2160   <S {Gui}.> Were you a woman, youth,
2161   I should woo hard, but be your Groome in honesty:
2162   I bid for you, as I do buy.
2163   <S {Arui}.> Ile make't my Comfort
2164   He is a man, Ile loue him as my Brother:
2165   And such a welcome as I'ld giue to him
2166   (After long absence) such is yours. Most welcome:
2167   Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst Friends.
2168   <S {Imo}.> 'Mongst Friends?
2169   If Brothers: would it had bin so, that they
2170   Had bin my Fathers Sonnes, then had my prize
2171   Bin lesse, and so more equall ballasting
2172   To thee {Posthumus}.
2173   <S {Bel}.> He wrings at some distresse.
2174   <S {Gui}.> Would I could free't.
2175   <S {Arui}.> Or I, what ere it be,
2176   What paine it cost, what danger: Gods!
2177   <S {Bel}.> Hearke Boyes.
2178   <S {Imo}.> Great men
2179   That had a Court no bigger then this Caue,
2180   That did attend themselues, and had the vertue
2181   Which their owne Conscience seal'd them: laying by
2182   That nothing- guift of differing Multitudes
2183   Could not out- peere these twaine. Pardon me Gods,
2184   I'ld change my sexe to be Companion with them,
2185   Since {Leonatus} false.
2186   <S {Bel}.> It shall be so:
2187   Boyes wee'l go dresse our Hunt. Faire youth come in;
2188   Discourse is heauy, fasting: when we haue supp'd
2189   Wee'l mannerly demand thee of thy Story,
2190   So farre as thou wilt speake it.
2191   <S {Gui}.> Pray draw neere.
2192   <S {Arui}.> The Night to'th' Owle,
2193   And Morne to th' Larke lesse welcome.
2194   <S {Imo}.> Thankes Sir.
2195   <S {Arui}.> I pray draw neere.  <D {Exeunt}.>

2198   <S 1.{Sen}.> This is the tenor of the Emperors Writ;

2200   'Gainst the Pannonians, and Dalmatians,
2201   And that the Legions now in Gallia, are
2202   Full weake to vndertake our Warres against

2204   The Gentry to this businesse. He creates

2206   For this immediate Leuy, he commands

2211   <S 1.{Sen}.> With those Legions
2212   Which I haue spoke of, whereunto your leuie

2219  *<S {Clot}> I am neere to'th' place where they should meet,

2221  *serue me? Why should his Mistris who was made by him
      <P aaa6>
2222  *that made the Taylor, not be fit too? The rather (sauing
2223  *reuerence of the Word) for 'tis saide a Womans fitnesse
2224  *comes by fits: therein I must play the Workman, I dare
2225  *speake it to my selfe, for it is not Vainglorie for a man,
2226  *and his Glasse, to confer in his owne Chamber; I meane,

2233  *{Posthumus}, thy head (which now is growing vppon thy

2236  *all this done, spurne her home to her Father, who may
2237  *(happily) be a little angry for my so rough vsage: but my

2259   Cannot amend me. Society, is no comfort
2260   To one not sociable: I am not very sicke,
2261   Since I can reason of it: pray you trust me heere,
2262   Ile rob none but my selfe, and let me dye
2263   Stealing so poorely.
2264   <S {Gui}.> I loue thee: I haue spoke it,
2265   How much the quantity, the waight as much,
2266   As I do loue my Father.
2267   <S {Bel}.> What? How? how?
2268   <S {Arui}.> If it be sinne to say so (Sir) I yoake mee
2269   In my good Brothers fault: I know not why
2270   I loue this youth, and I haue heard you say,
2271   Loue's reason's, without reason. The Beere at doore,
2272   And a demand who is't shall dye, I'ld say
2273   My Father, not this youth.
2274   <S {Bel}.> Oh noble straine!
2275   O worthinesse of Nature, breed of Greatnesse!
2276   "Cowards father Cowards, & Base things Syre Bace;
2277   "Nature hath Meale, and Bran; Contempt, and Grace.
2278   I'me not their Father, yet who this should bee,
2279   Doth myracle it selfe, lou'd before mee.
2280   'Tis the ninth houre o'th' Morne.
2281   <S {Arui}.> Brother, farewell.
2282   <S {Imo}.> I wish ye sport.
2283   <S {Arui}.> You health. === So please you Sir.
2284   <S {Imo}.> These are kinde Creatures.
2285   Gods, what lyes I haue heard:
2286   Our Courtiers say, all's sauage, but at Court;
2287   Experience, oh thou disproou'st Report.
2288   Th' emperious Seas breeds Monsters; for the Dish,
2289   Poore Tributary Riuers, as sweet Fish:
2290   I am sicke still, heart- sicke; {Pisanio},
2291   Ile now taste of thy Drugge.
2292   <S {Gui}.> I could not stirre him:
2293   He said he was gentle, but vnfortunate;
2294   Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
2295   <S {Arui}.> Thus did he answer me: yet said heereafter,
2296   I might know more.
2297   <S {Bel}.> To'th' Field, to'th' Field:
2298   Wee'l leaue you for this time, go in, and rest.
2299   <S {Arui}.> Wee'l not be long away.
2300   <S {Bel}.> Pray be not sicke,
2301   For you must be our Huswife.
2302   <S {Imo}.> Well, or #ill,
2303   I am bound to you.  <D {Exit}.>
2304   <S {Bel}.> And shal't be euer.
2305   This youth, how ere distrest, appeares he hath had
2306   Good Ancestors.
2307   <S {Arui}.> How Angell- like he sings?
2308   <S {Gui}.> But his neate Cookerie?
2309   <S {Arui}.> He cut our Rootes in Charracters,
2310   And sawc'st our Brothes, as {Iuno} had bin sicke,
2311   And he her Dieter.
2312   <S {Arui}.> Nobly he yoakes
2313   A smiling, with a sigh; as if the sighe
2314   Was that it was, for not being such a Smile:
2315   The Smile, mocking the Sigh, that it would flye
2316   From so diuine a Temple, to commix
2317   With windes, that Saylors raile at.
2318   <S {Gui}.> I do note,
2319   That greefe and patience rooted in them both,
2320   Mingle their spurres together.
2321   <S {Arui}.> Grow patient,
2322   And let the stinking- Elder (Greefe) vntwine
2323   His perishing roote, with the encreasing Vine.
2324  *<S {Bel}.> It is great morning. Come away: Who's there?
2325   <D {Enter Cloten}.>
2326   <S {Clo}.> I cannot finde those Runnagates, that Villaine
2327   Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
2328   <S {Bel}.> Those Runnagates?
2329   Meanes he not vs? I partly know him, 'tis
2330   {Cloten}, the Sonne o'th' Queene. I feare some Ambush:
2331   I saw him not these many yeares, and yet
2332   I know 'tis he: We are held as Out- Lawes: Hence.
2333   <S {Gui}.> He is but one: you, and my Brother search
2334   What Companies are neere: pray you away,
2335   Let me alone with him.
2336   <S {Clot}.> Soft, what are you
2337   That flye me thus? Some villaine- Mountainers?
2338   I haue heard of such. What Slaue art thou?
2339   <S {Gui}.> A thing
2340   More slauish did I ne're, then answering
2341   A Slaue without a knocke.
2342   <S {Clot}.> Thou art a Robber,
2343   A Law- breaker, a Villaine: yeeld thee Theefe.
2344   <S {Gui}.> To who? to thee? What art thou? Haue not I
2345   An arme as bigge as thine? A heart, as bigge:
2346   Thy words I grant are bigger: for I weare not
2347   My Dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art:
      <P aaa6v>
2348   Why I should yeeld to thee?
2349   <S {Clot}.> Thou Villaine base,
2350   Know'st me not by my Cloathes?
2351   <S {Gui}.> No, nor thy Taylor, Rascall:
2352   Who is thy Grandfather? He made those cloathes,
2353   Which (as it seemes) make thee.
2354   <S {Clo}.> Thou precious Varlet,
2355   My Taylor made them not.
2356   <S {Gui}.> Hence then, and thanke
2357   The man that gaue them thee. Thou art some Foole,
2358   I am loath to beate thee.
2359   <S {Clot}.> Thou iniurious Theefe,
2360   Heare but my name, and tremble.
2361   <S {Gui}.> What's thy name?
2362   <S {Clo}.> {Cloten}, thou Villaine.
2363   <S {Gui}.> {Cloten}, thou double Villaine be thy name,
2364   I cannot tremble at it, were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
2365   'Twould moue me sooner.
2366   <S {Clot}.> To thy further feare,
2367   Nay, to thy meere Confusion, thou shalt know
2368   I am Sonne to'th' Queene.
2369   <S {Gui}.> I am sorry for't: not seeming
2370   So worthy as thy Birth.
2371   <S {Clot}.> Art not afeard?
2372  *<S {Gui}.> Those that I reuerence, those I feare: the Wise:
2373   At Fooles I laugh: not feare them.
2374   <S {Clot}.> Dye the death:
2375   When I haue slaine thee with my proper hand,
2376   Ile follow those that euen now fled hence:
2377   And on the Gates of {Luds- Towne} set your heads:
2378   Yeeld Rusticke Mountaineer.  <D {Fight and Exeunt}.>
2379   <D {Enter Belarius and Aruiragus}.>
2380   <S {Bel}.> No Companie's abroad?
2381   <S {Arui}.> None in the world: you did mistake him sure.
2382   <S {Bel}.> I cannot tell: Long is it since I saw him,
2383   But Time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of Fauour
2384   Which then he wore: the snatches in his voice,
2385   And burst of speaking were as his: I am absolute
2386   'Twas very {Cloten}.
2387   <S {Arui}.> In this place we left them;
2388   I wish my Brother make good time with him,
2389   You say he is so fell.
2390   <S {Bel}.> Being scarse made vp,
2391   I meane to man; he had not apprehension
2392   Of roaring terrors: For defect of iudgement
2393   Is oft the cause of Feare.
2394   <D {Enter Guiderius}.>
2395   But see thy Brother.
2396   <S {Gui}.> This {Cloten} was a Foole, an empty purse,
2397   There was no money in't: Not {Hercules}
2398   Could haue knock'd out his Braines, for he had none:
2399   Yet I not doing this, the Foole had borne
2400   My head, as I do his.
2401   <S {Bel}.> What hast thou done?
2402   <S {Gui}.> I am perfect what: cut off one {Clotens} head,
2403   Sonne to the Queene (after his owne report)
2404   Who call'd me Traitor, Mountaineer, and swore
2405   With his owne single hand heel'd take vs in,
2406  *Displace our heads, where (thanks the Gods) they grow
2407   And set them on {Luds- Towne}.
2408   <S {Bel}.> We are all vndone.
2409   <S {Gui}.> Why, worthy Father, what haue we to loose,
2410   But that he swore to take our Liues? the Law
2411   Protects not vs, then why should we be tender,
2412   To let an arrogant peece of flesh threat vs?
2413   Play Iudge, and Executioner, all himselfe?
2414   For we do feare the Law. What company
2415   Discouer you abroad?
2416   <S {Bel}.> No single soule
2417   Can we set eye on: but in all safe reason
2418   He must haue some Attendants. Though his Honor
2419   Was nothing but mutation, #I, and that
2420   From one bad thing to worse: Not Frenzie,
2421   Not absolute madnesse could so farre haue rau'd
2422   To bring him heere alone: although perhaps
2423   It may be heard at Court, that such as wee
2424   Caue heere, hunt heere, are Out- lawes, and in time
2425   May make some stronger head, the which he hearing,
2426   (As it is like him) might breake out, and sweare
2427   Heel'd fetch vs in, yet is't not probable
2428   To come alone, either he so vndertaking,
2429   Or they so suffering: then on good ground we feare,
2430   If we do feare this Body hath a taile
2431   More perillous then the head.
2432   <S {Arui}.> Let Ord'nance
2433   Come as the Gods fore- say it: howsoere,
2434   My Brother hath done well.
2435   <S {Bel}.> I had no minde
2436   To hunt this day: The Boy {Fideles} sickenesse
2437   Did make my way long forth.
2438   <S {Gui}.> With his owne Sword,
2439   Which he did waue against my throat, I haue tane
2440   His head from him: Ile throw't into the Creeke
2441   Behinde our Rocke, and let it to the Sea,
2442   And tell the Fishes, hee's the Queenes Sonne, {Cloten},
2443   That's all I reake.  <D {Exit}.>
2444   <S {Bel}.> I feare 'twill be reueng'd:
2445   Would ({Polidore}) thou had'st not done't: though valour
2446   Becomes thee well enough.
2447   <S {Arui}.> Would I had done't:
2448   So the Reuenge alone pursu'de me: {Polidore}
2449   I loue thee brotherly, but enuy much
2450   Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would Reuenges
2451  *That possible strength might meet, wold seek vs through
2452   And put vs to our answer.
2453   <S {Bel}.> Well, 'tis done:
2454   Wee'l hunt no more to day, nor seeke for danger
2455   Where there's no profit. I prythee to our Rocke,
2456   You and {Fidele} play the Cookes: Ile stay
2457   Till hasty {Polidore} returne, and bring him
2458   To dinner presently.
2459   <S {Arui}.> Poore sicke {Fidele}.
2460   Ile willingly to him, to gaine his colour,
2461   Il'd let a parish of such {Clotens} blood,
2462   And praise my selfe for charity.  <D {Exit}.>
2463   <S {Bel}.> Oh thou Goddesse,
2464   Thou diuine Nature; thou thy selfe thou blazon'st
2465   In these two Princely Boyes: they are as gentle
2466   As Zephires blowing below the Violet,
2467   Not wagging his sweet head; and yet, as rough
2468   (Their Royall blood enchaf'd) as the rud'st winde,
2469   That by the top doth take the Mountaine Pine,
2470   And make him stoope to th' Vale. 'Tis wonder
2471   That an inuisible instinct should frame them
2472   To Royalty vnlearn'd, Honor vntaught,
2473   Ciuility not seene from other: valour
2474   That wildely growes in them, but yeelds a crop
2475   As if it had beene sow'd: yet still it's strange
2476   What {Clotens} being heere to vs portends,
2477   Or what his death will bring vs.
2478   <D {Enter Guidereus}.>
2479   <S {Gui}.> Where's my Brother?
      <P bbb1>
2480   I haue sent {Clotens} Clot- pole downe the streame,
2481   In Embassie to his Mother; his Bodie's hostage
2482   For his returne.  <D {Solemn Musick}.>
2483   <S {Bel}.> My ingenuous Instrument,
2484   (Hearke {Polidore}) it sounds: but what occasion
2485   Hath {Cadwal} now to giue it motion? Hearke.
2486   <S {Gui}.> Is he at home?
2487   <S {Bel}.> He went hence euen now.
2488   <S {Gui}.> What does he meane?
2489   Since death of my deer'st Mother
2490   It did not speake before. All solemne things
2491   Should answer solemne Accidents. The matter?
2492   Triumphes for nothing, and lamenting Toyes,
2493   Is iollity for Apes, and greefe for Boyes.
2494   Is {Cadwall} mad?
2495   <D {Enter Aruiragus, with Imogen dead, bearing}
2496   {her in his Armes}.>
2497   <S {Bel}.> Looke, heere he comes,
2498   And brings the dire occasion in his Armes,
2499   Of what we blame him for.
2500   <S {Arui}.> The Bird is dead
2501   That we haue made so much on. I had rather
2502   Haue skipt from sixteene yeares of Age, to sixty:
2503   To haue turn'd my leaping time into a Crutch,
2504   Then haue seene this.
2505   <S {Gui}.> Oh sweetest, fayrest Lilly:
2506   My Brother weares thee not the one halfe so well,
2507   As when thou grew'st thy selfe.
2508   <S {Bel}.> Oh Melancholly,
2509   Who euer yet could sound thy bottome? Finde
2510   The Ooze, to shew what Coast thy sluggish care
2511   Might'st easilest harbour in. Thou blessed thing,
2512   Ioue knowes what man thou might'st haue made: but I,
2513   Thou dyed'st a most rare Boy, of Melancholly.
2514   How found you him?
2515   <S {Arui}.> Starke, as you see:
2516   Thus smiling, as some Fly had tickled slumber,
2517   Not as deaths dart being laugh'd at: his right Cheeke
2518   Reposing on a Cushion.
2519   <S {Gui}.> Where?
2520   <S {Arui}.> O'th' floore:
2521   His armes thus leagu'd, I thought he slept, and put
2522  *My clowted Brogues from off my feete, whose rudenesse
2523   Answer'd my steps too lowd.
2524   <S {Gui}.> Why, he but sleepes:
2525   If he be gone, hee'l make his Graue, a Bed:
2526   With female Fayries will his Tombe be haunted,
2527   And Wormes will not come to thee.
2528   <S {Arui}.> With fayrest Flowers
2529   Whil'st Sommer lasts, and I liue heere, {Fidele},
2530   Ile sweeten thy sad graue: thou shalt not lacke
2531   The Flower that's like thy face. Pale- Primrose, nor
2532   The azur'd Hare- Bell, like thy Veines: no, nor
2533   The leafe of Eglantine, whom not to slander,
2534   Out- sweetned not thy breath: the Raddocke would
2535   With Charitable bill (Oh bill sore shaming
2536   Those rich- left- heyres, that let their Fathers lye
2537   Without a Monument) bring thee all this,
2538  *Yea, and furr'd Mosse besides. When Flowres are none
2539   To winter- ground thy Coarse===
2540   <S {Gui}.> Prythee haue done,
2541   And do not play in Wench- like words with that
2542   Which is so serious. Let vs bury him,
2543   And not protract with admiration, what
2544   Is now due debt. To'th' graue.
2545   <S {Arui}.> Say, where shall's lay him?
2546   <S {Gui}.> By good {Euriphile}, our Mother.
2547   <S {Arui}.> Bee't so:
2548   And let vs ({Polidore}) though now our voyces
2549   Haue got the mannish cracke, sing him to'th' ground
2550   As once to our Mother: vse like note, and words,
2551   Saue that {Euriphile}, must be {Fidele}.
2552   <S {Gui}.> {Cadwall},
2553   I cannot sing: Ile weepe, and word it with thee;
2554   For Notes of sorrow, out of tune, are worse
2555   Then Priests, and Phanes that lye.
2556   <S {Arui}.> Wee'l speake it then.
2557  *<S {Bel}.> Great greefes I see med'cine the lesse: For {Cloten}
2558   Is quite forgot. He was a Queenes Sonne, Boyes,
2559   And though he came our Enemy, remember
2560  *He was paid for that: though meane, and mighty rotting
2561   Together haue one dust, yet Reuerence
2562   (That Angell of the world) doth make distinction
2563   Of place 'tweene high, and low. Our Foe was Princely,
2564   And though you tooke his life, as being our Foe,
2565   Yet bury him, as a Prince.
2566   <S {Gui}.> Pray you fetch him hither,
2567   {Thersites} body is as good as {Aiax},
2568   When neyther are aliue.
2569   <S {Arui}.> If you'l go fetch him,
2570   Wee'l say our Song the whil'st: Brother begin.
2571   <S {Gui}.> Nay {Cadwall}, we must lay his head to th' East,
2572   My Father hath a reason for't.
2573   <S {Arui}.> 'Tis true.
2574   <S {Gui}.> Come on then, and remoue him.
2575   <S {Arui}.> So, begin.

2602   <S {Gui}.> We haue done our obsequies:
2603   Come lay him downe.
2604  *<S {Bel}.> Heere's a few Flowres, but 'bout midnight more:
2605   The hearbes that haue on them cold dew o'th' night
2606   Are strewings fit'st for Graues: vpon their Faces.
2607   You were as Flowres, now wither'd: euen so
2608   These Herbelets shall, which we vpon you strew.
2609   Come on, away, apart vpon our knees:
2610   The ground that gaue them first, ha's them againe:
2611   Their pleasures here are past, so are their paine.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P bbb1v>
2612   <D {Imogen awakes}.>
2613   Yes Sir, to Milford- Hauen, which is the way?
2614   I thanke you: by yond bush? pray how farre thether?
2615   'Ods pittikins: can it be sixe mile yet?
2616   I haue gone all night: 'Faith, Ile lye downe, and sleepe.
2617   But soft; no Bedfellow? Oh Gods, and Goddesses!
2618   These Flowres are like the pleasures of the World;
2619   This bloody man the care on't. I hope I dreame:
2620   For so I thought I was a Caue- keeper,
2621   And Cooke to honest Creatures. But 'tis not so:
2622   'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot of nothing,
2623   Which the Braine makes of Fumes. Our very eyes,
2624  *Are sometimes like our Iudgements, blinde. Good faith
2625   I tremble still with feare: but if there be
2626   Yet left in Heauen, as small a drop of pittie
2627   As a Wrens eye; fear'd Gods, a part of it.
2628   The Dreame's heere still: euen when I wake it is
2629   Without me, as within me: not imagin'd, felt.
2630   A headlesse man? The Garments of {Posthumus}?
2631   I know the shape of's Legge: this is his Hand:
2632   His Foote Mercuriall: his martiall Thigh
2633   The brawnes of {Hercules}: but his Iouiall face===
2634   Murther in heauen? How? 'tis gone. {Pisanio},
2635   All Curses madded {Hecuba} gaue the Greekes,
2636   And mine to boot, be darted on thee: thou
2637   Conspir'd with that Irregulous diuell {Cloten},
2638   Hath heere cut off my Lord. To write, and read,
2639   Be henceforth treacherous. Damn'd {Pisanio},
2640   Hath with his forged Letters (damn'd {Pisanio})
2641   From this most brauest vessell of the world
2642   Strooke the maine top! Oh {Posthumus}, alas,
2643  *Where is thy head? where's that? Aye me! where's that?
2644   {Pisanio} might haue kill'd thee at the heart,
2645   And left this head on. How should this be, {Pisanio}?
2646   'Tis he, and {Cloten}: Malice, and Lucre in them
2647   Haue laid this Woe heere. Oh 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
2648   The Drugge he gaue me, which hee said was precious
2649   And Cordiall to me, haue I not found it
2650   Murd'rous to'th' Senses? That confirmes it home:
2651   This is {Pisanio's} deede, and {Cloten}: Oh!
2652   Giue colour to my pale cheeke with thy blood,
2653   That we the horrider may seeme to those
2654   Which chance to finde vs. Oh, my Lord! my Lord!
2655   <D {Enter Lucius, Captaines, and a Soothsayer}.>
2656   <S {Cap}.> To them, the Legions garrison'd in Gallia
2657   After your #will, haue crost the Sea, attending
2658   You heere at Milford- Hauen, with your Shippes:
2659   They are heere in readinesse.
2660   <S {Luc}.> But what from Rome?
2661   <S {Cap}.> The Senate hath stirr'd vp the Confiners,
2662   And Gentlemen of Italy, most willing Spirits,
2663   That promise Noble Seruice: and they come
2664   Vnder the Conduct of bold {Iachimo},
2665   {Syenna's} Brother.
2666   <S {Luc}.> When expect you them?
2667   <S {Cap}.> With the next benefit o'th' winde.
2668   <S {Luc}.> This forwardnesse
2669  *Makes our hopes faire. Command our present numbers
2670   Be muster'd: bid the Captaines looke too't. Now Sir,
2671   What haue you dream'd of late of this warres purpose.
2672   <S {Sooth}.> Last night, the very Gods shew'd me a vision
2673   (I fast, and pray'd for their Intelligence) thus:
2674   I saw Ioues Bird, the Roman Eagle wing'd
2675   From the spungy South, to this part of the West,
2676   There vanish'd in the Sun- beames, which portends
2677   (Vnlesse my sinnes abuse my Diuination)
2678   Successe to th' Roman hoast.
2679   <S {Luc}.> Dreame often so,
2680   And neuer false. Soft hoa, what truncke is heere?
2681   Without his top? The ruine speakes, that sometime
2682   It was a worthy building. How? a Page?
2683   Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather:
2684   For Nature doth abhorre to make his bed
2685   With the defunct, or sleepe vpon the dead.
2686   Let's see the Boyes face.
2687   <S {Cap}.> Hee's aliue my Lord.
2688  *<S {Luc}.> Hee'l then instruct vs of this body: Young one,
2689   Informe vs of thy Fortunes, for it seemes
2690   They craue to be demanded: who is this
2691   Thou mak'st thy bloody Pillow? Or who was he
2692   That (otherwise then noble Nature did)
2693   Hath alter'd that good Picture? What's thy interest
2694   In this sad wracke? How came't? Who is't?
2695   What art thou?
2696   <S {Imo}.> I am nothing; or if not,
2697   Nothing to be were better: This was my Master,
2698   A very valiant Britaine, and a good,
2699   That heere by Mountaineers lyes slaine: Alas,
2700   There is no more such Masters: I may wander
2701   From East to Occident, cry out for Seruice,
2702   Try many, all good: serue truly: neuer
2703   Finde such another Master.
2704   <S {Luc}.> 'Lacke, good youth:
2705   Thou mou'st no lesse with thy complaining, then
2706   Thy Maister in bleeding: say his name, good Friend.
2707   <S {Imo}.> {Richard du Champ}: If I do lye, and do
2708   No harme by it, though the Gods heare, I hope
2709   They'l pardon it. Say you Sir?
2710   <S {Luc}.> Thy name?
2711   <S {Imo}.> {Fidele} Sir.
2712   <S {Luc}.> Thou doo'st approue thy selfe the very same:
2713   Thy Name well fits thy Faith; thy Faith, thy Name:
2714   Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
2715   Thou shalt be so well master'd, but be sure
2716   No lesse belou'd. The Romane Emperors Letters
2717   Sent by a Consull to me, should not sooner
2718   Then thine owne worth preferre thee: Go with me.
2719   <S {Imo}.> Ile follow Sir. But first, and't please the Gods,
2720   Ile hide my Master from the Flies, as deepe
2721   As these poore Pickaxes can digge: and when
2722  *With wild wood- leaues & weeds, I #ha' strew'd his graue
2723   And on it said a Century of prayers
2724   (Such as I can) twice o're, Ile weepe, and sighe,
2725   And leauing so his seruice, follow you,
2726   So please you entertaine mee.
2727   <S {Luc}.> #I good youth,
2728   And rather Father thee, then Master thee: My Friends,
2729   The Boy hath taught vs manly duties: Let vs
2730   Finde out the prettiest Dazied- Plot we can,
2731   And make him with our Pikes and Partizans
2732   A Graue: Come, Arme him: Boy hee's preferr'd
2733   By thee, to vs, and he shall be interr'd
2734   As Souldiers can. Be cheerefull; wipe thine eyes,
2735   Some Falles are meanes the happier to arise.  <D {Exeunt}>
2736   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2737   <D {Enter Cymbeline, Lords, and Pisanio}.>
2738   <S {Cym}.> Againe: and bring me word how 'tis with her,
2739   A Feauour with the absence of her Sonne;
      <P bbb2>
2740   A madnesse, of which her life's in danger: Heauens,
2741   How deeply you at once do touch me. {Imogen},
2742   The great part of my comfort, gone: My Queene
2743   Vpon a desperate bed, and in a time
2744   When fearefull Warres point at me: Her Sonne gone,
2745   So needfull for this present? It strikes me, past
2746   The hope of comfort. But for thee, Fellow,
2747   Who needs must know of her departure, and
2748   Dost seeme so ignorant, wee'l enforce it from thee
2749   By a sharpe Torture.
2750   <S {Pis}.> Sir, my life is yours,
2751   I humbly set it at your #will: But for my Mistris,
2752   I nothing know where she remaines: why gone,
2753  *Nor when she purposes returne. Beseech your Highnes,
2754   Hold me your loyall Seruant.
2755   <S {Lord}.> Good my Liege,
2756   The day that she was missing, he was heere;
2757   I dare be bound hee's true, and shall performe
2758   All parts of his subiection loyally. For {Cloten},
2759   There wants no diligence in seeking him,
2760   And will no doubt be found.
2761   <S {Cym}.> The time is troublesome:
2762   Wee'l slip you for a season, but our iealousie
2763   Do's yet depend.
2764   <S {Lord}.> So please your Maiesty,
2765   The Romaine Legions, all from Gallia drawne,
2766   Are landed on your Coast, with a supply
2767   Of Romaine Gentlemen, by the Senate sent.
2768  *<S {Cym}.> Now for the Counsaile of my Son and Queen,
2769   I am amaz'd with matter.
2770   <S {Lord}.> Good my Liege,
2771   Your preparation can affront no lesse
2772  *Then what you heare of. Come more, for more you're |(ready:
2773   The want is, but to put those Powres in motion,
2774   That long to moue.
2775   <S {Cym}.> I thanke you: let's withdraw
2776   And meete the Time, as it seekes vs. We feare not
2777   What can from Italy annoy vs, but
2778   We greeue at chances heere. Away.  <D {Exeunt}>
2779   <S {Pisa}.> I heard no Letter from my Master, since
2780   I wrote him {Imogen} was slaine. 'Tis strange:
2781   Nor heare I from my Mistris, who did promise
2782   To yeeld me often tydings. Neither know I
2783   What is betide to {Cloten}, but remaine
2784   Perplext in all. The Heauens still must worke:
2785   Wherein I am false, I am honest: not true, to be true.
2786   These present warres shall finde I loue my Country,
2787   Euen to the note o'th' King, or Ile fall in them:
2788   All other doubts, by time let them be cleer'd,
2789   Fortune brings in some Boats, that are not steer'd.  <D {Exit}.>
2790   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2791   <D {Enter Belarius, Guiderius, & Aruiragus}.>
2792   <S {Gui}.> The noyse is round about vs.
2793   <S {Bel}.> Let vs from it.
2794   <S {Arui}.> What pleasure Sir, we finde in life, to locke it
2795   From Action, and Aduenture.
2796   <S {Gui}.> Nay, what hope
2797   Haue we in hiding vs? This way the Romaines
2798   Must, or for Britaines slay vs, or receiue vs
2799   For barbarous and vnnaturall Reuolts
2800   During their vse, and slay vs after.
2801   <S {Bel}.> Sonnes,
2802   Wee'l higher to the Mountaines, there secure vs.
2803   To the Kings party there's no going: newnesse
2804   Of {Clotens} death (we being not knowne, nor muster'd
2805   Among the Bands) may driue vs to a render
2806   Where we haue liu'd; and so extort from's that
2807   Which we haue done, whose answer would be death
2808   Drawne on with Torture.
2809   <S {Gui}.> This is (Sir) a doubt
2810   In such a time, nothing becomming you,
2811   Nor satisfying vs.
2812   <S {Arui}.> It is not likely,
2813   That when they heare their Roman horses neigh,
2814   Behold their quarter'd Fires; haue both their eyes
2815   And eares so cloyd importantly as now,
2816   That they will waste their time vpon our note,
2817   To know from whence we are.
2818   <S {Bel}.> Oh, I am knowne
2819   Of many in the Army: Many yeeres
2820  *(Though {Cloten} then but young) you see, not wore him
2821   From my remembrance. And besides, the King
2822   Hath not deseru'd my Seruice, nor your Loues,
2823   Who finde in my Exile, the want of Breeding;
2824   The certainty of this heard life, aye hopelesse
2825   To haue the courtesie your Cradle promis'd,
2826   But to be still hot Summers Tanlings, and
2827   The shrinking Slaues of Winter.
2828   <S {Gui}.> Then be so,
2829   Better to cease to be. Pray Sir, to'th' Army:
2830   I, and my Brother are not knowne; your selfe
2831   So out of thought, and thereto so ore- growne,
2832   Cannot be question'd.
2833   <S {Arui}.> By this Sunne that shines
2834   Ile thither: What thing is't, that I neuer
2835   Did see man dye, scarse euer look'd on blood,
2836   But that of Coward Hares, hot Goats, and Venison?
2837   Neuer bestrid a Horse saue one, that had
2838   A Rider like my selfe, who ne're wore Rowell,
2839   Nor Iron on his heele? I am asham'd
2840   To looke vpon the holy Sunne, to haue
2841   The benefit of his blest Beames, remaining
2842   So long a poore vnknowne.
2843   <S {Gui}.> By heauens Ile go,
2844   If you will blesse me Sir, and giue me leaue,
2845   Ile take the better care: but if you will not,
2846   The hazard therefore due fall on me, by
2847   The hands of Romaines.
2848   <S {Arui}.> So say I, Amen.
2849   <S {Bel}.> No reason I (since of your liues you set
2850   So slight a valewation) should reserue
2851   My crack'd one to more care. Haue with you Boyes:
2852   If in your Country warres you chance to dye,
2853   That is my Bed too (Lads) and there Ile lye.
2854  *Lead, lead; the time seems long, their blood thinks scorn
2855   Till it flye out, and shew them Princes borne.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2856   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2857   <D {Enter Posthumus alone}.>
2858  *<S {Post}.> Yea bloody cloth, Ile keep thee: for I am wisht
2859   Thou should'st be colour'd thus. You married ones,
2860   If each of you should take this course, how many
2861   Must murther Wiues much better then themselues
      <P bbb2v>
2862   For wrying but a little? Oh {Pisanio},
2863   Euery good Seruant do's not all Commands:
2864   No Bond, but to do iust ones. Gods, if you
2865   Should haue 'tane vengeance on my faults, I neuer
2866   Had liu'd to put on this: so had you saued
2867   The noble {Imogen}, to repent, and strooke
2868   Me (wretch) more worth your Vengeance. But alacke,
2869   You snatch some hence for little faults; that's loue
2870   To haue them fall no more: you some permit
2871   To second illes with illes, each elder worse,
2872   And make them dread it, to the dooers thrift.
2873   But {Imogen} is your owne, do your best willes,
2874   And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither
2875   Among th' Italian Gentry, and to fight
2876   Against my Ladies Kingdome: 'Tis enough
2877   That (Britaine) I haue kill'd thy Mistris: Peace,
2878   Ile giue no wound to thee: therefore good Heauens,
2879   Heare patiently my purpose. Ile disrobe me
2880   Of these Italian weedes, and suite my selfe
2881   As do's a {Britaine} Pezant: so Ile fight
2882   Against the part I come with: so Ile dye
2883   For thee (O {Imogen}) euen for whom my life
2884   Is euery breath, a death: and thus, vnknowne,
2885   Pittied, nor hated, to the face of perill
2886   My selfe Ile dedicate. Let me make men know
2887   More valour in me, then my habits show.
2888   Gods, put the strength o'th'{#Leonati} in me:
2889   To shame the guize o'th' world, I will begin,
2890   The fashion lesse without, and more within.  <D {Exit}.>
2891   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2892  *<D {Enter Lucius, Iachimo, and the Romane Army at one doore}:
2893  *{and the Britaine Army at another: Leonatus Posthumus}
2894  *{following like a poore Souldier. They march ouer, and goe}
2895  *{out. Then enter againe in Skirmish Iachimo and Posthu-mus}:
2896  *{he vanquisheth and disarmeth Iachimo, and then}
2897   {leaues him}.>
2898   <S {Iac}.> The heauinesse and guilt within my bosome,
2899   Takes off my manhood: I haue belyed a Lady,
2900   The Princesse of this Country; and the ayre on't
2901   Reuengingly enfeebles me, or could this Carle,
2902   A very drudge of Natures, haue subdu'de me
2903   In my profession? Knighthoods, and Honors borne
2904   As I weare mine) are titles but of scorne.
2905   If that thy Gentry (Britaine) go before
2906   This Lowt, as he exceeds our Lords, the oddes
2907   Is, that we scarse are men, and you are Goddes.  <D {Exit}.>
2908  *<D {The Battaile continues, the Britaines fly, Cymbeline is}

2912   The Lane is guarded: Nothing rowts vs, but
2913   The villany of our feares.
2914   <S {Gui}. {Arui}.> Stand, stand, and fight.
2915   <D {Enter Posthumus, and seconds the Britaines. They Rescue}

2919   For friends kil friends, and the disorder's such
2920   As warre were hood- wink'd.
2921   <S {Iac}.> 'Tis their fresh supplies.
2922   <S {Luc}.> It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
2923   Let's re- inforce, or fly.  <D {Exeunt}>
2924   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2925   <D {Enter Posthumus, and a Britaine Lord}.>
2926   <S {Lor}.> Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?
2927   <S {Post}.> I did,
2928   Though you it seemes come from the Fliers?
2929   <S {Lo}.> I did.
2930   <S {Post}.> No blame be to you Sir, for all was lost,
2931   But that the Heauens fought: the King himselfe
2932   Of his wings destitute, the Army broken,
2933   And but the backes of Britaines seene; all flying
2934   Through a strait Lane, the Enemy full- heart'd,
2935   Lolling the Tongue with slaught'ring: hauing worke
2936   More plentifull, then Tooles to doo't: strooke downe
2937   Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
2938   Meerely through feare, that the strait passe was damm'd
2939   With deadmen, hurt behinde, and Cowards liuing
2940   To dye with length'ned shame.
2941   <S {Lo}.> Where was this Lane?
2942  *<S {Post}.> Close by the battell, ditch'd, & wall'd with turph,
2943   Which gaue aduantage to an ancient Soldiour
2944   (An honest one I warrant) who deseru'd
2945   So long a breeding, as his white beard came to,
2946   In doing this for's Country. Athwart the Lane,
2947   He, with two striplings (Lads more like to run
2948   The Country base, then to commit such slaughter,
2949   With faces fit for Maskes, or rather fayrer
2950   Then those for preseruation cas'd, or shame)
2951   Made good the passage, cryed to those that fled.
2952   Our {Britaines} hearts dye flying, not our men,
2953   To darknesse fleete soules that flye backwards; stand,
2954   Or we are Romanes, and will giue you that
2955   Like beasts, which you shun beastly, and may saue
2956  *But to looke backe in frowne: Stand, stand. These three,
2957   Three thousand confident, in acte as many:
2958   For three performers are the File, when all
2959   The rest do nothing. With this word stand, stand,
2960   Accomodated by the Place; more Charming
2961   With their owne Noblenesse, which could haue turn'd
2962   A Distaffe, to a Lance, guilded pale lookes;
2963  *Part shame, part spirit renew'd, that some turn'd coward
2964   But by example (Oh a sinne in Warre,
2965   Damn'd in the first beginners) gan to looke
2966   The way that they did, and to grin like Lyons
2967   Vpon the Pikes o'th' Hunters. Then beganne
2968   A stop i'th' Chaser; a Retyre: Anon
2969   A Rowt, confusion thicke: forthwith they flye
2970   Chickens, the way which they stopt Eagles: Slaues
2971   The strides the Victors made: and now our Cowards
2972   Like Fragments in hard Voyages became
2973   The life o'th' need: hauing found the backe doore open
2974   Of the vnguarded hearts: heauens, how they wound,
2975   Some slaine before some dying; some their Friends
2976   Ore- borne i'th' former waue, ten chac'd by one,
2977   Are now each one the slaughter- man of twenty:
2978   Those that would dye, or ere resist, are growne
2979   The mortall bugs o'th' Field.
      <P bbb3>
2980   <S {Lord}.> This was strange chance:
2981   A narrow Lane, an old man, and two Boyes.
2982   <S {Post}.> Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
2983   Rather to wonder at the things you heare,
2984   Then to worke any. Will you Rime vpon't,
2985   And vent it for a Mock'rie? Heere is one:
2986   "{Two Boyes, an Oldman (twice a Boy) a Lane},
2987   "{Preseru'd the Britaines, was the Romanes bane}.
2988   <S {Lord}.> Nay, be not angry Sir.
2989   <S {Post}.> Lacke, to what end?
2990   Who dares not stand his Foe, Ile be his Friend:
2991   For if hee'l do, as he is made to doo,
2992   I know hee'l quickly flye my friendship too.
2993   You haue put me into Rime.
2994   <S {Lord}.> Farewell, you're angry.  <D {Exit}.>
2995   <S {Post}.> Still going? This is a Lord: Oh Noble misery
2996   To be i'th' Field, and aske what newes of me:
2997   To day, how many would haue giuen their Honours
2998   To haue sau'd their Carkasses? Tooke #heele to doo't,
2999   And yet dyed too. I, in mine owne woe charm'd
3000   Could not finde death, where I did heare him groane,
3001  *Nor feele him where he strooke. Being an vgly Monster,
3002   'Tis strange he hides him in fresh Cups, soft Beds,
3003   Sweet words; or hath moe ministers then we
3004   That draw his kniues i'th' War. Well I will finde him:
3005   For being now a Fauourer to the Britaine,
3006   No more a Britaine, I haue resum'd againe
3007   The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
3008   But yeeld me to the veriest Hinde, that shall
3009   Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
3010   Heere made by'th' Romane; great the Answer be
3011   Britaines must take. For me, my Ransome's death,
3012   On eyther side I come to spend my breath;
3013   Which neyther heere Ile keepe, nor beare agen,
3014   But end it by some meanes for {Imogen}.
3015   <D {Enter two Captaines, and Soldiers}.>
3016   <S 1> Great Iupiter be prais'd, {Lucius} is taken,
3017   'Tis thought the old man, and his sonnes, were Angels.
3018   <S 2> There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
3019   That gaue th' Affront with them.
3020   <S 1> So 'tis reported:
3021   But none of 'em can be found. Stand, who's there?
3022   <S {Post}.> A Roman,
3023   Who had not now beene drooping heere, if Seconds
3024   Had answer'd him.
3025   <S 2> Lay hands on him: a Dogge,
3026   A legge of Rome shall not returne to tell
3027  *What Crows haue peckt them here: he brags his seruice
3028   As if he were of note: bring him to'th' King.
3029  *<D {Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Aruiragus, Pisanio, and}

3034   <S {Gao}.> You shall not now be stolne,
3035   You haue lockes vpon you:
3036   So graze, as you finde Pasture.
3037   <S 2.{Gao}.> #I, or a stomacke.
3038   <S {Post}.> Most welcome bondage; for thou art a way
3039   (I thinke) to liberty: yet am I better
3040   Then one that's sicke o'th' Gowt, since he had rather
3041   Groane so in perpetuity, then be cur'd
3042   By'th' sure Physitian, Death; who is the key
3043  *T' vnbarre these Lockes. My Conscience, thou art fetter'd
3044  *More then my shanks, & wrists: you good Gods giue me
3045   The penitent Instrument to picke that Bolt,
3046   Then free for euer. Is't enough I am sorry?
3047   So Children temporall Fathers do appease;
3048   Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
3049   I cannot do it better then in Gyues,
3050   Desir'd, more then constrain'd, to satisfie
3051   If of my Freedome 'tis the maine part, take
3052   No stricter render of me, then my All.
3053   I know you are more clement then vilde men,
3054   Who of their broken Debtors take a third,
3055   A sixt, a tenth, letting them thriue againe
3056   On their abatement; that's not my desire.
3057   For {Imogens} deere life, take mine, and though
3058   'Tis not so deere, yet 'tis a life; you coyn'd it,
3059   'Tweene man, and man, they waigh not euery stampe:
3060   Though light, take Peeces for the figures sake,
3061   (You rather) mine being yours: and so great Powres,
3062   If you will take this Audit, take this life,
3063   And cancell these cold Bonds. Oh {Imogen},
3064   Ile speake to thee in silence.

3075   Rates, and Reuenges.
3076   Hath my poore Boy done ought but well,
3077   whose face I neuer saw:

3080   Whose Father then (as men report,
3081   thou Orphanes Father art)
3082   Thou should'st haue bin, and sheelded him,
3083   from this earth- vexing smart.
3084   <S {Moth}.> {Lucina} lent not me her ayde,

3086   That from me was {Posthumus} ript,
3087   came crying 'mong'st his Foes.
3088   A thing of pitty.
3089   <S {Sicil}.> Great Nature like his Ancestrie,
3090   moulded the stuffe so faire:
3091   That he deseru'd the praise o'th' World,
3092   as great {Sicilius} heyre.

3094   in Britaine where was hee

3096   Or fruitfull obiect bee?
3097   In eye of {Imogen}, that best could deeme
3098   his dignitie.

3100   to be exil'd, and throwne
3101   From {Leonati} Seate, and cast from her,
3102   his deerest one:
3103   Sweete {Imogen}?
3104  *<S {Sic}.> Why did you suffer {Iachimo}, slight thing of Italy,
      <P bbb3v>
3105  *To taint his Nobler hart & braine, with needlesse ielousy,
3106  *And to become the geeke and scorne o'th' others vilany?
3107   <S 2 {Bro}.> For this, from stiller Seats we came,
3108   our Parents, and vs twaine,
3109   That striking in our Countries cause,
3110   fell brauely, and were slaine,

3112   <S 1 {Bro}.> Like hardiment {Posthumus} hath

3151   Was sulphurous to smell: the holy Eagle

3153   More sweet then our blest Fields: his Royall Bird
3154   Prunes the immortall wing, and cloyes his Beake,

3161   A Father to me: and thou hast created
3162   A Mother, and two Brothers. But (oh scorne)
3163   Gone, they went hence so soone as they were borne:
3164   And so I am awake. Poore Wretches, that depend
3165   On Greatnesse, Fauour; Dreame as I haue done,
3166   Wake, and finde nothing. But (alas) I swerue:
3167   Many Dreame not to finde, neither deserue,

3190   <S {Gao}.> Come Sir, are you ready for death?
3191   <S {Post}.> Ouer- roasted rather: ready long ago.
3192  *<S {Gao}.> Hanging is the word, Sir, if you bee readie for
3193   that, you are well Cook'd.
3194  *<S {Post}.> So if I proue a good repast to the Spectators, the
3195   dish payes the shot.
3196  *<S {Gao}.> A heauy reckoning for you Sir: But the comfort
3197  *is you shall be called to no more payments, fear no more
3198  *Tauerne Bils, which are often the sadnesse of parting, as
3199  *the procuring of mirth: you come in faint for want of
3200  *meate, depart reeling with too much drinke: sorrie that
3201  *you haue payed too much, and sorry that you are payed
3202  *too much: Purse and Braine, both empty: the Brain the
3203  *heauier, for being too light; the Purse too light, being
3204  *drawne of heauinesse. Oh, of this contradiction you shall
3205  *now be quit: Oh the charity of a penny Cord, it summes
3206  *vp thousands in a trice: you haue no true Debitor, and
3207  *Creditor but it: of what's past, is, and to come, the dis-charge:
3208  *your necke (Sir) is Pen, Booke, and Counters; so
3209   the Acquittance followes.
3210   <S {Post}.> I am merrier to dye, then thou art to liue.
3211  *<S {Gao}.> Indeed Sir, he that sleepes, feeles not the Tooth- Ache:
3212  *but a man that were to sleepe your sleepe, and a
3213  *Hangman to helpe him to bed, I think he would change
3214  *places with his Officer: for, look you Sir, you know not
3215   which way you shall go.
3216   <S {Post}.> Yes indeed do I, fellow.
3217  *<S {Gao}.> Your death has eyes in's head then: I haue not
3218  *seene him so pictur'd: you must either bee directed by
3219  *some that take vpon them to know, or to take vpon your
3220  *selfe that which I am sure you do not know: or iump the
3221  *after- enquiry on your owne perill: and how you shall
3222  *speed in your iournies end, I thinke you'l neuer returne
3223   to tell one.
3224  *<S {Post}.> I tell thee, Fellow, there are none want eyes, to
3225  *direct them the way I am going, but such as winke, and
3226   will not vse them.
3227  *<S {Gao}.> What an infinite mocke is this, that a man shold
3228  *haue the best vse of eyes, to see the way of blindnesse: I
3229   am sure hanging's the way of winking.
3230   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
3231  *<S {Mes}.> Knocke off his Manacles, bring your Prisoner to

3238  *<S {Gao}.> Vnlesse a man would marry a Gallowes, & be-get

3241  *he be a Roman; and there be some of them too that dye
3242  *against their willes; so should I, if I were one. I would
3243  *we were all of one minde, and one minde good: O there

3252   That the poore Souldier that so richly fought,
3253  *Whose ragges, sham'd gilded Armes, whose naked brest
3254   Stept before Targes of proofe, cannot be found:
3255   He shall be happy that can finde him, if
3256   Our Grace can make him so.
3257   <S {Bel}.> I neuer saw
3258   Such Noble fury in so poore a Thing;
3259   Such precious deeds, in one that promist nought
3260   But beggery, and poore lookes.
3261   <S {Cym}.> No tydings of him?
3262  *<S {Pisa}.> He hath bin search'd among the dead, & liuing;
3263   But no trace of him.

3265   The heyre of his Reward, which I will adde
3266   To you (the Liuer, Heart, and Braine of Britaine)

3271   Further to boast, were neyther true, nor modest,
3272   Vnlesse I adde, we are honest.
3273   <S {Cym}.> Bow your knees:
3274   Arise my Knights o'th' Battell, I create you
3275   Companions to our person, and will fit you
3276   With Dignities becomming your estates.
3277   <D {Enter Cornelius and Ladies}.>
3278   There's businesse in these faces: why so sadly
3279   Greet you our Victory? you looke like Romaines,
3280   And not o'th' Court of Britaine.
3281   <S {Corn}.> Hayle great King,
3282   To sowre your happinesse, I must report
3283   The Queene is dead.
3284   <S {Cym}.> Who worse then a Physitian
3285   Would this report become? But I consider,
3286   By Med'cine life may be prolong'd, yet death
3287   Will seize the Doctor too. How ended she?
3288   <S {Cor}.> With horror, madly dying, like her life,
3289   Which (being cruell to the world) concluded
3290   Most cruell to her selfe. What she confest,
3291   I will report, so please you. These her Women
3292   Can trip me, if I erre, who with wet cheekes
3293   Were present when she finish'd.
3294   <S {Cym}.> Prythee say.
3295   <S {Cor}.> First, she confest she neuer lou'd you: onely
3296   Affected Greatnesse got by you: not you:
3297   Married your Royalty, was wife to your place:
3298   Abhorr'd your person.
3299   <S {Cym}.> She alone knew this:
3300   And but she spoke it dying, I would not
3301   Beleeue her lips in opening it. Proceed.
3302  *<S {Corn}.> Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to loue
3303   With such integrity, she did confesse
3304   Was as a Scorpion to her sight, whose life
3305   (But that her flight preuented it) she had
3306   Tane off by poyson.
3307   <S {Cym}.> O most delicate Fiend!
3308   Who is't can reade a Woman? Is there more?
3309   <S {Corn}.> More Sir, and worse. She did confesse she had
3310   For you a mortall Minerall, which being tooke,
3311   Should by the minute feede on life, and ling'ring,
3312   By inches waste you. In which time, she purpos'd
3313   By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
3314   Orecome you with her shew; and in time
3315   (When she had fitted you with her craft, to worke
3316   Her Sonne into th' adoption of the Crowne:
3317   But fayling of her end by his strange absence,
3318   Grew shamelesse desperate, open'd (in despight
3319   Of Heauen, and Men) her purposes: repented
3320   The euils she hatch'd, were not effected: so
3321   Dispayring, dyed.
3322   <S {Cym}.> Heard you all this, her Women?
3323   <S {La}.> We did, so please your Highnesse.
3324   <S {Cym}.> Mine eyes
3325   Were not in fault, for she was beautifull:
3326   Mine eares that heare her flattery, nor my heart,
3327  *That thought her like her seeming. It had beene vicious
3328   To haue mistrusted her: yet (Oh my Daughter)
3329   That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
3330   And proue it in thy feeling. Heauen mend all.
3331   <D {Enter Lucius, Iachimo, and other Roman prisoners},
3332   {Leonatus behind, and Imogen}.>
3333   Thou comm'st not {Caius} now for Tribute, that
3334   The Britaines haue rac'd out, though with the losse
3335   Of many a bold one: whose Kinsmen haue made suite
3336  *That their good soules may be appeas'd, with slaughter
3337   Of you their Captiues, which our selfe haue granted,
3338   So thinke of your estate.
3339   <S {Luc}.> Consider Sir, the chance of Warre, the day
3340   Was yours by accident: had it gone with vs,
3341  *We should not when the blood was cool, haue threatend
3342   Our Prisoners with the Sword. But since the Gods
3343   Will haue it thus, that nothing but our liues
3344   May be call'd ransome, let it come: Sufficeth,
3345   A Roman, with a Romans heart can suffer:
3346   {Augustus} liues to thinke on't: and so much
3347   For my peculiar care. This one thing onely
3348   I will entreate, my Boy (a Britaine borne)
3349   Let him be ransom'd: Neuer Master had
3350   A Page so kinde, so duteous, diligent,
3351   So tender ouer his occasions, true,
3352   So feate, so Nurse- like: let his vertue ioyne
3353  *With my request, which Ile make bold your Highnesse
3354   Cannot deny: he hath done no Britaine harme,
3355   Though he haue seru'd a Roman. Saue him (Sir)
3356   And spare no blood beside.
3357   <S {Cym}.> I haue surely seene him:
3358   His fauour is familiar to me: Boy,
3359   Thou hast look'd thy selfe into my grace,
3360   And art mine owne. I know not why, wherefore,
3361   To say, liue boy: ne're thanke thy Master, liue;
3362   And aske of {Cymbeline} what Boone thou wilt,
3363   Fitting my bounty, and thy state, Ile giue it:
      <P bbb4v>
3364   Yea, though thou do demand a Prisoner
3365   The Noblest tane.
3366   <S {Imo}.> I humbly thanke your Highnesse.
3367   <S {Luc}.> I do not bid thee begge my life, good Lad,
3368   And yet I know thou wilt.
3369   <S {Imo}.> No, no, alacke,
3370   There's other worke in hand: I see a thing
3371   Bitter to me, as death: your life, good Master,
3372   Must shuffle for it selfe.
3373   <S {Luc}.> The Boy disdaines me,
3374   He leaues me, scornes me: briefely dye their ioyes,
3375   That place them on the truth of Gyrles, and Boyes.
3376   Why stands he so perplext?
3377   <S {Cym}.> What would'st thou Boy?
3378   I loue thee more, and more: thinke more and more
3379  *What's best to aske. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak
3380   Wilt haue him liue? Is he thy Kin? thy Friend?
3381   <S {Imo}.> He is a Romane, no more kin to me,
3382  *Then I to your Highnesse, who being born your vassaile
3383   Am something neerer.
3384   <S {Cym}.> Wherefore ey'st him so?
3385   <S {Imo}.> Ile tell you (Sir) in priuate, if you please
3386   To giue me hearing.
3387   <S {Cym}.> #I, with all my heart,
3388   And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
3389   <S {Imo}.> {Fidele} Sir.
3390   <S {Cym}.> Thou'rt my good youth: my Page
3391   Ile be thy Master: walke with me: speake freely.
3392   <S {Bel}.> Is not this Boy reuiu'd from death?
3393   <S {Arui}.> One Sand another
3394   Not more resembles that sweet Rosie Lad:
3395   Who dyed, and was {Fidele}: what thinke you?
3396   <S {Gui}.> The same dead thing aliue.
3397  *<S {Bel}.> Peace, peace, see further: he eyes vs not, forbeare
3398   Creatures may be alike: were't he, I am sure
3399   He would haue spoke to vs.
3400   <S {Gui}.> But we see him dead.
3401   <S {Bel}.> Be silent: let's see further.
3402   <S {Pisa}.> It is my Mistris:
3403   Since she is liuing, let the time run on,
3404   To good, or bad.
3405   <S {Cym}.> Come, stand thou by our side,
3406   Make thy demand alowd. Sir, step you forth,
3407   Giue answer to this Boy, and do it freely,
3408   Or by our Greatnesse, and the grace of it
3409   (Which is our Honor) bitter torture shall
3410   Winnow the truth from falshood. One speake to him.
3411   <S {Imo}.> My boone is, that this Gentleman may render
3412   Of whom he had this Ring.
3413   <S {Post}.> What's that to him?
3414   <S {Cym}.> That Diamond vpon your Finger, say
3415   How came it yours?
3416   <S {Iach}.> Thou'lt torture me to leaue vnspoken, that
3417   Which to be spoke, wou'd torture thee.
3418   <S {Cym}.> How? me?
3419   <S {Iach}.> I am glad to be constrain'd to vtter that
3420   Which torments me to conceale. By Villany
3421   I got this Ring: 'twas {Leonatus} Iewell,
3422  *Whom thou did'st banish: and which more may greeue |(thee,
3423   As it doth me: a Nobler #Sir, ne're liu'd
3424  *'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou heare more my Lord?
3425   <S {Cym}.> All that belongs to this.
3426   <S {Iach}.> That Paragon, thy daughter,
3427   For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
3428   Quaile to remember. Giue me leaue, I faint.
3429  *<S {Cym}.> My Daughter? what of hir? Renew thy strength
3430   I had rather thou should'st liue, while Nature will,
3431   Then dye ere I heare more: striue man, and speake.
3432   <S {Iach}.> Vpon a time, vnhappy was the clocke
3433   That strooke the houre: it was in Rome, accurst
3434   The Mansion where: 'twas at a Feast, oh would
3435   Our Viands had bin poyson'd (or at least
3436   Those which I heau'd to head:) the good {Posthumus},
3437   (What should I say? he was too good to be
3438   Where #ill men were, and was the best of all
3439   Among'st the rar'st of good ones) sitting sadly,
3440   Hearing vs praise our Loues of Italy
3441   For Beauty, that made barren the swell'd boast
3442   Of him that best could speake: for Feature, laming
3443   The Shrine of {Venus}, or straight- pight {Minerua},
3444   Postures, beyond breefe Nature. For Condition,
3445   A shop of all the qualities, that man
3446   Loues woman for, besides that hooke of Wiuing,
3447   Fairenesse, which strikes the eye.
3448   <S {Cym}.> I stand on fire. Come to the matter.
3449   <S {Iach}.> All too soone I shall,
3450  *Vnlesse thou would'st greeue quickly. This {Posthumus},
3451   Most like a Noble Lord, in loue, and one
3452   That had a Royall Louer, tooke his hint,
3453   And (not dispraising whom we prais'd, therein
3454   He was as calme as vertue) he began
3455   His Mistris picture, which, by his tongue, being made,
3456   And then a minde put in't, either our bragges
3457   Were crak'd of Kitchin- Trulles, or his description
3458   Prou'd vs vnspeaking sottes.
3459   <S {Cym}.> Nay, nay, to'th' purpose.
3460   <S {Iach}.> Your daughters Chastity, (there it beginnes)
3461   He spake of her, as {Dian} had hot dreames,
3462   And she alone, were cold: Whereat, I wretch
3463   Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him
3464   Peeces of Gold, 'gainst this, which then he wore
3465   Vpon his honour'd finger) to attaine
3466   In suite the place of's bed, and winne this Ring
3467   By hers, and mine Adultery: he (true Knight)
3468   No lesser of her Honour confident
3469   Then I did truly finde her, stakes this Ring,
3470   And would so, had it beene a Carbuncle
3471   Of Phoebus Wheele; and might so safely, had it
3472   Bin all the worth of's Carre. Away to Britaine
3473   Poste I in this designe: Well may you (Sir)
3474   Remember me at Court, where I was taught
3475   Of your chaste Daughter, the wide difference
3476   'Twixt Amorous, and Villanous. Being thus quench'd
3477   Of hope, not longing; mine Italian braine,
3478   Gan in your duller Britaine operate
3479   Most vildely: for my vantage excellent.
3480   And to be breefe, my practise so preuayl'd
3481   That I return'd with simular proofe enough,
3482   To make the Noble {Leonatus} mad,
3483   By wounding his beleefe in her Renowne,
3484   With Tokens thus, and thus: auerring notes
3485   Of Chamber- hanging, Pictures, this her Bracelet
3486   (Oh cunning how I got) nay some markes
3487   Of secret on her person, that he could not
3488   But thinke her bond of Chastity quite crack'd,
3489   I hauing 'tane the forfeyt. Whereupon,
3490   Me thinkes I see him now.
3491   <S {Post}.> #I so thou do'st,
3492   Italian Fiend. Aye me, most credulous Foole,
3493   Egregious murtherer, Theefe, any thing
3494   That's due to all the Villaines past, in being
3495   To come. Oh giue me Cord, or knife, or poyson,
      <P bbb5>
3496   Some vpright Iusticer. Thou King, send out
3497   For Torturors ingenious: it is I
3498   That all th' abhorred things o'th' earth amend
3499   By being worse then they. I am {Posthumus},
3500   That kill'd thy Daughter: Villain- like, I lye,
3501   That caus'd a lesser villaine then my selfe,
3502   A sacrilegious Theefe to doo't. The Temple
3503   Of Vertue was she; yea, and she her selfe.
3504   Spit, and throw stones, cast myre vpon me, set
3505   The dogges o'th' street to bay me: euery villaine
3506   Be call'd {Posthumus Leonatus}, and
3507   Be villany lesse then 'twas. Oh {Imogen}!
3508   My Queene, my life, my wife: oh {Imogen},
3509   {Imogen, Imogen}.
3510   <S {Imo}.> Peace my Lord, heare, heare.
3511   <S {Post}.> Shall's haue a play of this?
3512   Thou scornfull Page, there lye thy part.
3513   <S {Pis}.> Oh Gentlemen, helpe,
3514   Mine and your Mistris: Oh my Lord {Posthumus},
3515   You ne're kill'd {Imogen} till now: helpe, helpe,
3516   Mine honour'd Lady.
3517   <S {Cym}.> Does the world go round?
3518   <S {Posth}.> How comes these staggers on mee?
3519   <S {Pisa}.> Wake my Mistris.
3520   <S {Cym}.> If this be so, the Gods do meane to strike me
3521   To death, with mortall ioy.
3522   <S {Pisa}.> How fares my Mistris?
3523   <S {Imo}.> Oh get thee from my sight,
3524   Thou gau'st me poyson: dangerous Fellow hence,
3525   Breath not where Princes are.
3526   <S {Cym}.> The tune of {Imogen}.
3527  *<S {Pisa}.> Lady, the Gods throw stones of sulpher on me, if
3528   That box I gaue you, was not thought by mee
3529   A precious thing, I had it from the Queene.
3530   <S {Cym}.> New matter still.
3531   <S {Imo}.> It poyson'd me.
3532   <S {Corn}.> Oh Gods!
3533   I left out one thing which the Queene confest,
3534   Which must approue thee honest. If {Pasanio}
3535   Haue (said she) giuen his Mistris that Confection
3536   Which I gaue him for Cordiall, she is seru'd,
3537   As I would serue a Rat.
3538   <S {Cym}.> What's this, {Cornelius}?
3539   <S {Corn}.> The Queene (Sir) very oft importun'd me
3540   To temper poysons for her, still pretending
3541   The satisfaction of her knowledge, onely
3542   In killing Creatures vilde, as Cats and Dogges
3543   Of no esteeme. I dreading, that her purpose
3544   Was of more danger, did compound for her
3545   A certaine stuffe, which being tane, would cease
3546   The present powre of life, but in short time,
3547   All Offices of Nature, should againe
3548   Do their due Functions. Haue you tane of it?
3549   <S {Imo}.> Most like I did, for I was dead.
3550   <S {Bel}.> My Boyes, there was our error.
3551   <S {Gui}.> This is sure {Fidele}.
3552  *<S {Imo}.> Why did you throw your wedded Lady fro[m] you?
3553   Thinke that you are vpon a Rocke, and now
3554   Throw me againe.
3555   <S {Post}.> Hang there like fruite, my soule,
3556   Till the Tree dye.
3557   <S {Cym}.> How now, my Flesh? my Childe?
3558   What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this Act?
3559   Wilt thou not speake to me?
3560   <S {Imo}.> Your blessing, Sir.
3561  *<S {Bel}.> Though you did loue this youth, I blame ye not,
3562   You had a motiue for't.
3563   <S {Cym}.> My teares that fall
3564   Proue holy- water on thee; {Imogen},
3565   Thy Mothers dead.
3566   <S {Imo}.> I am sorry for't, my Lord.
3567   <S {Cym}.> Oh, she was naught; and long of her it was
3568   That we meet heere so strangely: but her Sonne
3569   Is gone, we know not how, nor where.
3570   <S {Pisa}.> My Lord,
3571   Now feare is from me, Ile speake troth. Lord {Cloten}
3572   Vpon my Ladies missing, came to me
3573  *With his Sword drawne, foam'd at the mouth, and swore
3574   If I discouer'd not which way she was gone,
3575   It was my instant death. By accident,
3576   I had a feigned Letter of my Masters
3577   Then in my pocket, which directed him
3578   To seeke her on the Mountaines neere to Milford,
3579   Where in a frenzie, in my Masters Garments
3580   (Which he inforc'd from me) away he postes
3581   With vnchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
3582   My Ladies honor, what became of him,
3583   I further know not.
3584   <S {Gui}.> Let me end the Story: I slew him there.
3585   <S {Cym}.> Marry, the Gods forefend.
3586   I would not thy good deeds, should from my lips
3587   Plucke a hard sentence: Prythee valiant youth
3588   Deny't againe.
3589   <S {Gui}.> I haue spoke it, and I did it.
3590   <S {Cym}.> He was a Prince.
3591   <S {Gui}.> A most inciuill one. The wrongs he did mee
3592   Were nothing Prince- like; for he did prouoke me
3593   With Language that would make me spurne the Sea,
3594   If it could so roare to me. I cut off's head,
3595   And am right glad he is not standing heere
3596   To tell this tale of mine.
3597   <S {Cym}.> I am sorrow for thee:
3598   By thine owne tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
3599   Endure our Law: Thou'rt dead.
3600  *<S {Imo}.> That headlesse man I thought had bin my Lord
3601   <S {Cym}.> Binde the Offender,
3602   And take him from our presence.
3603   <S {Bel}.> Stay, Sir King.
3604   This man is better then the man he slew,
3605   As well descended as thy selfe, and hath
3606   More of thee merited, then a Band of {Clotens}
3607   Had euer scarre for. Let his Armes alone,
3608   They were not borne for bondage.
3609   <S {Cym}.> Why old Soldier:
3610   Wilt thou vndoo the worth thou art vnpayd for
3611   By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
3612   As good as we?
3613   <S {Arui}.> In that he spake too farre.
3614   <S {Cym}.> And thou shalt dye for't.
3615   <S {Bel}.> We will dye all three,
3616   But I will proue that two one's are as good
3617   As I haue giuen out him. My Sonnes, I must
3618   For mine owne part, vnfold a dangerous speech,
3619   Though haply well for you.
3620   <S {Arui}.> Your danger's ours.
3621   <S {Guid}.> And our good his.
3622   <S {Bel}.> Haue at it then, by leaue
3623   Thou hadd'st (great King) a Subiect, who
3624   Was call'd {Belarius}.
3625   <S {Cym}.> What of him? He is a banish'd Traitor.
3626   <S {Bel}.> He it is, that hath
3627   Assum'd this age: indeed a banish'd man,
      <P bbb5v>
3628   I know not how, a Traitor.
3629   <S {Cym}.> Take him hence,
3630   The whole world shall not saue him.
3631   <S {Bel}.> Not too hot;
3632   First pay me for the Nursing of thy Sonnes,
3633   And let it be confiscate all, so soone
3634   As I haue receyu'd it.
3635   <S {Cym}.> Nursing of my Sonnes?
3636   <S {Bel}.> I am too blunt, and sawcy: heere's my knee:
3637   Ere I arise, I will preferre my Sonnes,
3638   Then spare not the old Father. Mighty Sir,
3639   These two young Gentlemen that call me Father,
3640   And thinke they are my Sonnes, are none of mine,
3641   They are the yssue of your Loynes, my Liege,
3642   And blood of your begetting.
3643   <S {Cym}.> How? my Issue.
3644   <S {Bel}.> So sure as you, your Fathers: I (old {Morgan})
3645   Am that {Belarius}, whom you sometime banish'd:
3646   Your pleasure was my neere offence, my punishment
3647   It selfe, and all my Treason that I suffer'd,
3648   Was all the harme I did. These gentle Princes
3649   (For such, and so they are) these twenty yeares
3650   Haue I train'd vp; those Arts they haue, as I
3651   Could put into them. My breeding was (Sir)
3652   As your Highnesse knowes: Their Nurse {Euriphile}
3653   (Whom for the Theft I wedded) stole these Children
3654   Vpon my Banishment: I moou'd her too't,
3655   Hauing receyu'd the punishment before
3656   For that which I did then. Beaten for Loyaltie,
3657   Excited me to Treason. Their deere losse,
3658   The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd
3659   Vnto my end of stealing them. But gracious Sir,
3660   Heere are your Sonnes againe, and I must loose
3661   Two of the sweet'st Companions in the World.
3662   The benediction of these couering Heauens
3663   Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthie
3664   To in- lay Heauen with Starres.
3665   <S {Cym}.> Thou weep'st, and speak'st:
3666   The Seruice that you three haue done, is more
3667   Vnlike, then this thou tell'st. I lost my Children,
3668   If these be they, I know not how to wish
3669   A payre of worthier Sonnes.
3670   <S {Bel}.> Be pleas'd awhile;
3671   This Gentleman, whom I call {Polidore},
3672   Most worthy Prince, as yours, is true {Guiderius}:
3673   This Gentleman, my {Cadwall, Aruiragus}.
3674   Your yonger Princely Son, he Sir, was lapt
3675   In a most curious Mantle, wrought by th' hand
3676   Of his Queene Mother, which for more probation
3677   I can with ease produce.
3678   <S {Cym}.> {Guiderius} had
3679   Vpon his necke a Mole, a sanguine Starre,
3680   It was a marke of wonder.
3681   <S {Bel}.> This is he,
3682   Who hath vpon him still that naturall stampe:
3683   It was wise Natures end, in the donation
3684   To be his euidence now.
3685   <S {Cym}.> Oh, what am I
3686   A Mother to the byrth of three? Nere Mother
3687   Reioyc'd deliuerance more: Blest, pray you be,
3688   That after this strange starting from your Orbes,
3689   You may reigne in them now: Oh {Imogen},
3690   Thou hast lost by this a Kingdome.
3691   <S {Imo}.> No, my Lord:
3692   I haue got two Worlds by't. Oh my gentle Brothers,
3693   Haue we thus met? Oh neuer say heereafter
3694   But I am truest speaker. You call'd me Brother
3695   When I was but your Sister: I you Brothers,
3696   When we were so indeed.
3697   <S {Cym}.> Did you ere meete?
3698   <S {Arui}.> #I my good Lord.
3699   <S {Gui}.> And at first meeting lou'd,
3700   Continew'd so, vntill we thought he dyed.
3701   <S {Corn}.> By the Queenes Dramme she swallow'd.
3702   <S {Cym}.> O rare instinct!
3703  *When shall I heare all through? This fierce abridgment,
3704   Hath to it Circumstantiall branches, which
3705   Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liu'd you?
3706   And when came you to serue our Romane Captiue?
3707   How parted with your Brother? How first met them?
3708   Why fled you from the Court? And whether these?
3709   And your three motiues to the Battaile? with
3710   I know not how much more should be demanded,
3711   And all the other by- dependances
3712   From chance to chance? But nor the Time, nor Place
3713   Will serue our long Interrogatories. See,
3714   {Posthumus} Anchors vpon {Imogen};
3715   And she (like harmlesse Lightning) throwes her eye
3716   On him: her Brothers, Me: her Master hitting
3717   Each obiect with a Ioy: the Counter- change
3718   Is seuerally in all. Let's quit this ground,
3719   And smoake the Temple with our Sacrifices.
3720   Thou art my Brother, so wee'l hold thee euer.
3721   <S {Imo}.> You are my Father too, and did releeue me:
3722   To see this gracious season.
3723   <S {Cym}.> All ore- ioy'd
3724   Saue these in bonds, let them be ioyfull too,
3725   For they shall taste our Comfort.
3726   <S {Imo}.> My good Master, I will yet do you seruice.
3727   <S {Luc}.> Happy be you.
3728   <S {Cym}.> The forlorne Souldier, that so Nobly fought
3729   He would haue well becom'd this place, and grac'd
3730   The thankings of a King.
3731   <S {Post}.> I am Sir
3732   The Souldier that did company these three
3733   In poore beseeming: 'twas a fitment for
3734   The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
3735   Speake {Iachimo}, I had you downe, and might
3736   Haue made you finish.
3737   <S {Iach}.> I am downe againe:
3738   But now my heauie Conscience sinkes my knee,
3739   As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you
3740   Which I so often owe: but your Ring first,
3741   And heere the Bracelet of the truest Princesse
3742   That euer swore the Faith.
3743   <S {Post}.> Kneele not to me:
3744   The powre that I haue on you, is to spare you:
3745   The malice towards you, to forgiue you. Liue
3746   And deale with others better.
3747   <S {Cym}.> Nobly doom'd:
3748   Wee'l learne our Freenesse of a Sonne- in- Law:
3749   Pardon's the word to all.
3750   <S {Arui}.> You holpe vs Sir,
3751   As you did meane indeed to be our Brother,
3752   Ioy'd are we, that you are.
3753  *<S {Post}.> Your Seruant Princes. Good my Lord of Rome
3754   Call forth your Sooth- sayer: As I slept, me thought
3755   Great Iupiter vpon his Eagle back'd
3756   Appear'd to me, with other sprightly shewes
3757   Of mine owne Kindred. When I wak'd, I found
3758   This Labell on my bosome; whose containing
3759   Is so from sense in hardnesse, that I can
      <P bbb6>
3760   Make no Collection of it. Let him shew
3761   His skill in the construction.
3762   <S {Luc}.> {Philarmonus}.
3763   <S {Sooth}.> Heere, my good Lord.
3764   <S {Luc}.> Read, and declare the meaning.
3765   <D {Reades}.>

3773   Thou {Leonatus} art the Lyons Whelpe,
3774   The fit and apt Construction of thy name
3775   Being {Leonatus}, doth import so much:
3776   The peece of tender Ayre, thy vertuous Daughter,
3777   Which we call {Mollis Aer}, and {Mollis Aer}
3778   We terme it {Mulier}; which {Mulier} I diuine
3779   Is this most constant Wife, who euen now
3780   Answering the Letter of the Oracle,
3781   Vnknowne to you vnsought, were clipt about
3782   With this most tender Aire.
3783   <S {Cym}.> This hath some seeming.
3784   <S {Sooth}.> The lofty Cedar, Royall {Cymbeline}
3785   Personates thee: And thy lopt Branches, point
3786   Thy two Sonnes forth: who by {Belarius} stolne
3787   For many yeares thought dead, are now reuiu'd
3788   To the Maiesticke Cedar ioyn'd; whose Issue
3789   Promises Britaine, Peace and Plenty.
3790   <S {Cym}.> Well,
3791   My Peace we will begin: And {Caius Lucius},
3792   Although the Victor, we submit to {Caesar},
3793   And to the Romane Empire; promising
3794   To pay our wonted Tribute, from the which
3795   We were disswaded by our wicked Queene,
3796   Whom heauens in Iustice both on her, and hers,
3797   Haue laid most heauy hand.
3798   <S {Sooth}.> The fingers of the Powres aboue, do tune
3799   The harmony of this Peace: the Vision
3800   Which I made knowne to {Lucius} ere the stroke
3801   Of yet this scarse- cold- Battaile, at this instant
3802   Is full accomplish'd. For the Romaine Eagle
3803   From South to West, on wing soaring aloft
3804   Lessen'd her selfe, and in the Beames o'th' Sun
3805   So vanish'd; which fore- shew'd our Princely Eagle
3806   Th' Imperiall {Caesar}, should againe vnite
3807   His Fauour, with the Radiant {Cymbeline},
3808   Which shines heere in the West.
3809   <S {Cym}.> Laud we the Gods,
3810   And let our crooked Smoakes climbe to their Nostrils
3811   From our blest Altars. Publish we this Peace
3812   To all our Subiects. Set we forward: Let
3813   A Roman, and a Brittish Ensigne waue
3814   Friendly together: so through {Luds- Towne} march,
3815   And in the Temple of great Iupiter
3816   Our Peace wee'l ratifie: Seale it with Feasts.
3817   Set on there: Neuer was a Warre did cease
3818   (Ere bloodie hands were wash'd) with such a Peace.
3819   <D {Exeunt}.>

3822   CYMBELINE.>
