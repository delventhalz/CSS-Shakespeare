5      So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
6      Finde we a time for frighted Peace to pant,
7     *And breath shortwinded accents of new broils
8      To be commenc'd in Stronds a- farre remote:
9      No more the thirsty entrance of this Soile,
10     Shall daube her lippes with her owne childrens blood:
11     No more shall trenching Warre channell her fields,
12     Nor bruise her Flowrets with the Armed hoofes
13     Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,
14     Which like the Meteors of a troubled Heauen,
15     All of one Nature, of one Substance bred,
16     Did lately meete in the intestine shocke,
17     And furious cloze of ciuill Butchery,
18     Shall now in mutuall well- beseeming rankes
19     March all one way, and be no more oppos'd
20     Against Acquaintance, Kindred, and Allies.
21     The edge of Warre, like an ill- sheathed knife,
22     No more shall cut his Master. Therefore Friends,
23     As farre as to the Sepulcher of Christ,
24     Whose Souldier now vnder whose blessed Crosse
25     We are impressed and ingag'd to fight,
26     Forthwith a power of English shall we leuie,
27     Whose armes were moulded in their Mothers wombe,
28     To chace these Pagans in those holy Fields,
29     Ouer whose Acres walk'd those blessed feete
30     Which fourteene hundred yeares ago were nail'd
31     For our aduantage on the bitter Crosse.
32     But this our purpose is a tweluemonth old,
33     And bootlesse 'tis to tell you we will go:
34     Therefore we meete not now. Then let me heare
35     Of you my gentle Cousin Westmerland,
36     What yesternight our Councell did decree,
37     In forwarding this deere expedience.
38     <S {West}.> My Liege: This haste was hot in question,
39     And many limits of the Charge set downe
40     But yesternight: when all athwart there came
41     A Post from Wales, loaden with heauy Newes;
42     Whose worst was, That the Noble {Mortimer},
43     Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
44     Against the irregular and wilde {Glendower},
45     Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
46     And a thousand of his people butchered:
47     Vpon whose dead corpes there was such misuse,
48     Such beastly, shamelesse transformation,
49     By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
50     (Without much shame) re- told or spoken of.
51     <S {King}.> It seemes then, that the tidings of this broile,
52     Brake off our businesse for the Holy land.
53    *<S {West}.> This matcht with other like, my gracious Lord,
54     Farre more vneuen and vnwelcome Newes
55     Came from the North, and thus it did report:
56     On Holy- roode day, the gallant {Hotspurre} there,
57     Young {Harry Percy}, and braue {Archibald},
58     That euer- valiant and approoued Scot,
59     At {Holmeden} met, where they did spend
60     A sad and bloody houre:
61     As by discharge of their Artillerie,
62     And shape of likely- hood the newes was told:
63     For he that brought them, in the very heate
64     And pride of their contention, did take horse,
65     Vncertaine of the issue any way.
66     <S {King}.> Heere is a deere and true industrious friend,
67     Sir {Walter Blunt}, new lighted from his Horse,
68     Strain'd with the variation of each soyle,
69     Betwixt that {Holmedon}, and this Seat of ours:
70     And he hath brought vs smooth and welcome newes.
71     The Earle of {Dowglas} is discomfited,
72     Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty Knights
73     Balk'd in their owne blood did Sir {Walter} see
74     On {Holmedons} Plaines. Of Prisoners, {Hotspurre} tooke
75     {Mordake} Earle of Fife, and eldest sonne
76     To beaten {Dowglas}, and the Earle of {Atholl},
77     Of {Murry}, {Angus}, and {Menteith}.
78     And is not this an honourable spoyle?
79     A gallant prize? Ha Cosin, is it not? Infaith it is.
80     <S {West}.> A Conquest for a Prince to boast of.
81    *<S {King}.> Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, & mak'st me sin,
82     In enuy, that my Lord Northumberland
83     Should be the Father of so blest a Sonne:
84     A Sonne, who is the Theame of Honors tongue;
85     Among'st a Groue, the very straightest Plant,
86     Who is sweet Fortunes Minion, and her Pride:
87     Whil'st I by looking on the praise of him,
88     See Ryot and Dishonor staine the brow
89     Of  my yong {Harry}. O that it could be prou'd,
90     That some Night- tripping- Faiery, had exchang'd
91     In Cradle- clothes, our Children where they lay,
92     And call'd mine {Percy}, his {Plantagenet}:
      <P d6><C V>
93     Then would I haue his {Harry}, and he mine:
94     But let him from my thoughts. What thinke you Coze
95     Of this young {Percies} pride? The Prisoners
96     Which he in this aduenture hath surpriz'd,
97     To his owne vse he keepes, and sends me word
98     I shall haue none but {Mordake} Earle of {Fife}.
99    *<S {West}.> This is his Vnckles teaching. This is Worcester
100    Maleuolent to you in all Aspects:
101    Which makes him prune himselfe, and bristle vp
102    The crest of Youth against your Dignity.
103    <S {King}.> But I haue sent for him to answer this:
104    And for this cause a- while we must neglect
105    Our holy purpose to Ierusalem.
106    Cosin, on Wednesday next, our Councell we will hold
107    At Windsor, and so informe the Lords:
108    But come your selfe with speed to vs againe,
109    For more is to be saide, and to be done,
110    Then out of anger can be vttered.
111    <S {West}.> I will my Liege.  <D {Exeunt}>
112    <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
113    <D {Enter Henry Prince of Wales, Sir Iohn Fal-staffe},
114    {and Pointz}.>
115    <S {Fal}.> Now {Hal}, what time of day is it Lad?
116   *<S {Prince}.> Thou art so fat- witted with drinking of olde
117   *Sacke, and vnbuttoning thee after Supper, and sleeping
118   *vpon Benches in the afternoone, that thou hast forgotten
119   *to demand that truely, which thou wouldest truly know.
120   *What a diuell hast thou to do with the time of the day?
121   *vnlesse houres were cups of Sacke, and minutes Capons,
122   *and clockes the tongues of Bawdes, and dialls the signes
123   *of Leaping- houses, and the blessed Sunne himselfe a faire
124   *hot Wench in Flame- coloured Taffata; I see no reason,
125   *why thou shouldest bee so superfluous, to demaund the
126    time of the day.
127   *<S {Fal}.> Indeed you come neere me now {Hal}, for we that
128   *take Purses, go by the Moone and seuen Starres, and not
129   *by Phoebus hee, that wand'ring Knight so faire. And I
130   *prythee sweet Wagge, when thou art King, as God saue
131   *thy Grace, Maiesty I should say, for Grace thou wilte
132    haue none.
133    <S {Prin}.> What, none?
134   *<S {Fal}.> No, not so much as will serue to be Prologue to
135    an Egge and Butter.
136    <S {Prin}.> Well, how then? Come roundly,  roundly.
137   *<S {Fal}.> Marry then, sweet Wagge, when thou art King,
138   *let not vs that are Squires of the Nights bodie, bee call'd
139   *Theeues of the Dayes beautie. Let vs be {Dianaes} Forre-sters,
140   *Gentlemen of the Shade, Minions of the Moone;
141   *and let men say, we be men of good Gouernment, being
142   *gouerned as the Sea, by our noble and chast mistris the
143    Moone, vnder whose countenance we steale.
144   *<S {Prin}.> Thou say'st well, and it holds well too: for the
145   *fortune of vs that are the Moones men, doeth ebbe and
146   *flow like the Sea, beeing gouerned as the Sea is, by the
147   *Moone: as for proofe. Now a Purse of Gold most reso-lutely
148   *snatch'd on Monday night, and most dissolutely
149   *spent on Tuesday Morning; got with swearing, Lay by:
150   *and spent with crying, Bring in: now, in as low an ebbe
151   *as the foot of the Ladder,  and #by and by in as high a flow
152    as the ridge of the Gallowes.
153   *<S {Fal}.> Thou say'st true Lad: and is not my Hostesse of
154    the Tauerne a most sweet Wench?
155   *<S {Prin}.> As is the hony, my old Lad of the Castle: and is
156    not a Buffe Ierkin a most sweet robe of durance?
157   *<S {Fal}.> How now? how now mad Wagge? What in thy
158   *quips and thy quiddities? What a plague haue I to doe
159    with a Buffe- Ierkin?
160   *<S {Prin}.> Why, what a poxe haue I to doe with my Ho-stesse
161    of the Tauerne?
162   *<S {Fal}.> Well, thou hast call'd her to a reck'ning many a
163    time and oft.
164    <S {Prin}.> Did I euer call for thee to pay thy part?
165   *<S {Fal}.> No, Ile giue thee thy due, thou hast paid al there.
166   *<S {Prin}.> Yea and elsewhere, so farre as my Coine would
167    stretch, and where it would not, I haue vs'd my credit.
168   *<S {Fal}.> Yea, and so vs'd it, that were it heere apparant,
169   *that thou art Heire apparant. But I prythee sweet Wag,
170   *shall there be Gallowes standing in England when thou
171   *art King? and resolution thus fobb'd as it is, with the ru-stie
172   *curbe of old Father Anticke the Law? Doe not thou
173    when thou art a King, hang a Theefe.
174    <S {Prin}.> No, thou shalt.
175    <S {Fal}.> Shall I? O rare! Ile be a braue Iudge.
176   *<S {Prin}.> Thou iudgest false already. I meane, thou shalt
177   *haue the hanging of the Theeues, and so become a rare
178    Hangman.
179   *<S {Fal}.> Well {Hal}, well: and in some sort it iumpes with
180   *my humour, as well as waiting in the Court, I can tell
181    you.
182    <S {Prin}.> For obtaining of suites?
183   *<S {Fal}.> Yea, for obtaining of suites, whereof the Hang-man
184   *hath no leane Wardrobe. I am as Melancholly as a
185    Gyb- Cat, or a lugg'd Beare.
186    <S {Prin}.> Or an old Lyon, or a Louers Lute.
187    <S {Fal}.> Yea, or the Drone of a Lincolnshire Bagpipe.
188   *<S {Prin}.> What say'st thou to a Hare, or the Melancholly
189    of Moore Ditch?
190   *<S {Fal}.> Thou hast the most vnsauoury smiles, and art in-deed
191   *the most comparatiue rascallest sweet yong Prince.
192   *But {Hal}, I prythee  trouble me no more with vanity, I wold
193   *thou and I knew, where a Commodity of good names
194   *were to be bought: an olde Lord of the Councell rated
195   *me the other day in the street about you sir; but I mark'd
196   *him not, and yet hee talk'd very wisely, but I regarded
197    him not, and yet he talkt wisely, and in the street too.
198    <S {Prin}.> Thou didst well: for no man regards it.
199   *<S {Fal}.> O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeede
200   *able to corrupt a Saint. Thou hast done much harme vn-to
201   *me {Hall}, God forgiue thee for it. Before I knew thee
202   *{Hal}, I knew nothing: and now I am (if a man shold speake
203   *truly) little better then one of the wicked. I must giue o-uer
204   *this life, and I will giue it ouer: #and I do not, I am a
205   *Villaine. Ile be damn'd for neuer a Kings sonne in Chri-stendome.
206   _
207   *<S {Prin}.> Where shall we take a purse to morrow, Iacke?
208   *<S {Fal}.> Where thou wilt Lad, Ile make one: #and I doe
209    not, call me Villaine, and baffle me.
210   *<S {Prin}.> I see a good amendment of life in thee: From
211    Praying, to Purse- taking.
212   *<S {Fal}.> Why, {Hal}, 'tis my Vocation {Hal}: 'Tis no sin for a
213    man to labour in his Vocation.
214   *<S {Pointz}.> Now shall wee know if Gads hill haue set a
215   *Watch. O, if men were to be saued by merit, what hole
216   *in #Hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omni-potent
217    Villaine, that euer cryed, Stand, to a true man.
218    <S {Prin}.> Good morrow {Ned}.
      <P d6v>
219   *<S {Poines}.> Good morrow sweet {Hal}. What saies Mon-sieur
220   *remorse? What sayes Sir Iohn Sacke and Sugar:
221   *Iacke? How agrees the Diuell and thee about thy Soule,
222   *that thou soldest him on Good- Friday last, for a Cup of
223    Madera, and a cold Capons legge?
224   *<S {Prin}.> Sir Iohn stands to his word, the diuel shall haue
225   *his bargaine, for he was neuer yet a Breaker of Prouerbs:
226    {He will giue the diuell his due}.
227   *<S {Poin}.> Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with
228    the diuell.
229    <S {Prin}.> Else he had damn'd cozening the diuell.
230   *<S {Poy}.> But my Lads, my Lads, to morrow morning, by
231   *foure #a clocke early at Gads hill, there are Pilgrimes go-ing
232   *to Canterbury with rich Offerings, and Traders ri-ding
233   *to London with fat Purses. I haue vizards for you
234   *all; you haue horses for your selues: Gads- hill lyes to
235   *night in Rochester, I haue bespoke Supper to morrow in
236   *Eastcheape; we may doe it as secure as sleepe: if you will
237   *go, I will stuffe your Purses full of Crownes: if you will
238    not, tarry at home and be hang'd.
239   *<S {Fal}.> Heare ye Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,
240    Ile hang you for going.
241    <S {Poy}.> You will chops.
242    <S {Fal}.> {Hal}, wilt thou make one?
243    <S {Prin}.> Who, I rob? I a Theefe? Not I.
244   *<S {Fal}.> There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fel-lowship
245   *in thee, nor thou cam'st not of the blood- royall,
246    if thou dar'st not stand for ten shillings.
247    <S {Prin}.> Well then, once in my dayes Ile be a mad- cap.
248    <S {Fal}.> Why, that's well said.
249    <S {Prin}.> Well, come what will, Ile tarry at home.
250    <S {Fal}.> Ile be a Traitor then, when thou art King.
251    <S {Prin}.> I care not.
252   *<S {Poyn}.> Sir {Iohn}, I prythee leaue the Prince & me alone,
253   *I will lay him downe such reasons for this aduenture, that
254    he shall go.
255   *<S {Fal}.> Well, maist thou haue the Spirit of perswasion;
256   *and he the eares of profiting, that what thou speakest,
257   *may moue; and what he heares may be beleeued, that the
258   *true Prince, may (for recreation sake) proue a false theefe;
259   *for the poore abuses of the time, want countenance. Far-well,
260   *you shall finde me in Eastcheape.
261   *<S {Prin}.> Farwell the latter Spring. Farewell Alhollown
262    Summer.
263   *<S {Poy}.> Now, my good sweet Hony Lord, ride with vs
264   *to morrow. I haue a iest to execute, that I cannot man-nage
265   *alone. {Falstaffe}, {Haruey}, {Rossill}, and {Gads- hill}, shall
266   *robbe those men that wee haue already way- layde, your
267   *selfe and I, wil not be there: and when they haue the boo-ty,
268   *if you and I do  not rob them, cut this head from my
269    shoulders.
270   *<S {Prin}.> But how shal we part with them in setting forth?
271   *<S {Poyn}.> Why, we wil set forth before or after them, and
272   *appoint them a place of meeting, wherin it is at our plea-sure
273   *to faile; and then will they aduenture vppon the ex-ploit
274   *themselues, which they shall haue no sooner atchie-ued,
275    but wee'l set vpon them.
276   *<S {Prin}.> #I, but tis like that they will know vs by our
277   *horses, by our habits, and by euery other appointment to
278    be our selues.
279   *<S {Poy}.> Tut our horses they shall not see, Ile tye them in
280   *the wood, our vizards wee will change after wee leaue
281   *them: and sirrah, I haue Cases of Buckram for the nonce,
282    to immaske our noted outward garments.
283    <S {Prin}.> But I doubt they will be too hard for vs.
284   *<S {Poin}.> Well, for two of them, I know them to bee as
285   *true bred Cowards as euer turn'd backe: and for the third
286   *if he fight longer then he sees reason, Ile forswear Armes.
287   *The vertue of this Iest will be, the incomprehensible lyes
288   *that this fat Rogue will tell vs, when we meete at Supper:
289   *how thirty at least he fought with, what Wardes, what
290   *blowes, what extremities he endured; and in the reproofe
291    of this, lyes the iest.
292   *<S {Prin}.> Well, Ile goe with thee, prouide vs all things
293   *necessary, and meete me to morrow night in Eastcheape,
294    there Ile sup. Farewell.
295    <S {Poyn}.> Farewell, my Lord.  <D {Exit Pointz}>
296    <S {Prin}.> I know you all, and will a- while vphold
297    The vnyoak'd humor of your idlenesse:
298    Yet heerein will I imitate the Sunne,
299    Who doth permit the base contagious cloudes
300    To smother vp his Beauty from the world,
301    That when he please againe to be himselfe,
302    Being wanted, he may be more wondred at,
303    By breaking through the foule and vgly mists
304    Of vapours, that did seeme to strangle him.
305    If all the yeare were playing holidaies,
306    To sport, would be as tedious as to worke;
307    But when they seldome come, they wisht- for come,
308    And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
309    So when this loose behauiour I throw off,
310    And pay the debt I neuer promised;
311    By how much better then my word I am,
312    By so much shall I falsifie mens hopes,
313    And like bright Mettall on a sullen ground:
314    My reformation glittering o're my fault,
315    Shall shew more goodly, and attract more eyes,
316    Then that which hath no foyle to set it off.
317    Ile so offend, to make offence a skill,
318    Redeeming time, when men thinke least I will.
319    <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
320    <D {Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspurre},
321    {Sir Walter Blunt, and others}.>
322    <S {King}.> My blood hath beene too cold and temperate,
323    Vnapt to stirre at these indignities,
324    And you haue found me; for accordingly,
325    You tread vpon my patience: But be sure,
326    I will from henceforth rather be my Selfe,
327    Mighty, and to be fear'd, then my condition
328   *Which hath beene smooth as Oyle, soft as yong Downe,
329    And therefore lost that Title of respect,
330    Which the proud soule ne're payes, but to the proud.
331   *<S {Wor}.> Our house (my Soueraigne Liege) little deserues
332    The scourge of greatnesse to be vsed on it,
333    And that same greatnesse too, which our owne hands
334    Haue holpe to make so portly.
335    <S {Nor}.> My Lord.
336    <S {King}.> Worcester get thee gone: for I do see
337    Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
338    O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
339    And Maiestie might neuer yet endure
340    The moody Frontier of a seruant brow,
341    You haue good leaue to leaue vs. When we need
342    Your vse and counsell, we shall send for you.
343    You were about to speake.
344    <S {North}.> Yea, my good Lord.
      <P e1><C B>
345    Those Prisoners in your Highnesse demanded,
346    Which {Harry Percy} heere at {Holmedon} tooke,
347    Were (as he sayes) not with such strength denied
348    As was deliuered to your Maiesty:
349    Who either through enuy, or misprision,
350    Was guilty of this fault; and not my Sonne.
351    <S {Hot}.> My Liege, I did deny no Prisoners.
352    But, I remember when the fight was done,
353    When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,
354    Breathlesse, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,
355    Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly drest;
356    Fresh as a Bride- groome, and his Chin new reapt,
357    Shew'd like a stubble Land at Haruest home.
358    He was perfumed like a Milliner,
359    And 'twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he held
360    A Pouncet- box: which euer and anon
361    He gaue his Nose, and took't away againe:
362    Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
363    Tooke it in Snuffe. And still he smil'd and talk'd:
364    And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,
365    He call'd them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,
366    To bring a slouenly vnhandsome Coarse
367    Betwixt the Winde, and his Nobility.
368    With many Holiday and Lady tearme
369    He question'd me: Among the rest, demanded
370    My Prisoners, in your Maiesties behalfe.
371    I then, all- smarting, with my wounds being cold,
372    (To be so pestered with a Popingay)
373    Out of my Greefe, and my Impatience,
374    Answer'd (neglectingly) I know not what,
375    He should, or should not: For he made me mad,
376    To see him shine so briske, and smell so sweet,
377    And talke so like a Waiting- Gentlewoman,
378    Of Guns, & Drums, and Wounds: God saue the marke;
379    And telling me, the Soueraign'st thing on earth
380    Was Parmacity, for an inward bruise:
381    And that it was great pitty, so it was,
382    That villanous Salt- peter should be digg'd
383    Out of the Bowels of the harmlesse Earth,
384    Which many a good Tall Fellow had destroy'd
385    So Cowardly. And but for these vile Gunnes,
386    He would himselfe haue beene a Souldier.
387    This bald, vnioynted Chat of his (my Lord)
388    Made me to answer indirectly (as I said.)
389    And I beseech you,  let not this report
390    Come currant for an Accusation,
391    Betwixt my Loue, and your high Maiesty.
392    <S {Blunt}.> The circumstance considered, good my Lord,
393    What euer {Harry Percie} then had said,
394    To such a person, and in such a place,
395    At such a time, with all the rest retold,
396    May reasonably dye, and neuer rise
397    To do him wrong, or any way impeach
398    What then he said, so he vnsay it now.
399    <S {King}.>  Why yet doth deny his Prisoners,
400    But with Prouiso and Exception,
401    That we at our owne charge, shall ransome straight
402    His Brother- in- Law, the foolish {Mortimer},
403    Who (in my soule) hath wilfully betraid
404    The liues of those, that he did leade to Fight,
405    Against the great Magitian, damn'd {Glendower}:
406    Whose daughter (as we heare) the Earle of March
407    Hath lately married. Shall our Coffers then,
408    Be emptied, to redeeme a Traitor home?
409    Shall we buy Treason? and indent with Feares,
410    When they haue lost and forfeyted themselues.
411    No: on the barren Mountaine let him sterue:
412    For I shall neuer hold that man my Friend,
413    Whose tongue shall aske me for one peny cost
414    To ransome home reuolted {Mortimer}.
415    <S {Hot}.> Reuolted {Mortimer}?
416    He neuer did fall off, my Soueraigne Liege,
417    But by the chance of Warre: to proue that true,
418   *Needs no more but one tongue. For all those Wounds,
419    Those mouthed Wounds, which valiantly he tooke,
420    When on the gentle Seuernes siedgie banke,
421    In single Opposition hand to hand,
422    He did confound the best part of an houre
423    In changing hardiment with great {Glendower}:
424   *Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink
425    Vpon agreement, of swift Seuernes flood;
426    Who then affrighted with their bloody lookes,
427    Ran fearefully among the trembling Reeds,
428    And hid his crispe- head in the hollow banke,
429    Blood- stained with these Valiant Combatants.
430    Neuer did base and rotten Policy
431    Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
432    Nor neuer could the Noble {Mortimer}
433    Receiue so many, and all willingly:
434    Then let him not be sland'red with Reuolt.
435   *<S {King}.> Thou do'st bely him {Percy}, thou dost bely him;
436    He neuer did encounter with {Glendower}:
437    I tell thee, he durst as well haue met the diuell alone,
438    As {Owen Glendower} for an enemy.
439    Art thou not asham'd? But Sirrah, henceforth
440    Let me not heare you speake of {Mortimer}.
441    Send me your Prisoners with the speediest meanes,
442    Or you shall heare in such a kinde from me
443    As will displease ye. My Lord {Northumberland},
444    We License your departure with your sonne,
445    Send vs your Prisoners, or you'l heare of it.  <D {Exit King}.>
446    <S {Hot}.> #And if the diuell come and roare for them
447    I will not send them. I will after straight
448    And tell him so: for I will ease my heart,
449    Although it be with hazard of my head.
450   *<S {Nor}.> What? drunke with choller? stay & pause awhile,
451    Heere comes your Vnckle.  <D {Enter Worcester}.>
452    <S {Hot}.> Speake of {Mortimer}?
453    Yes, I will speake of him, and let my soule
454    Want mercy, if I do not ioyne with him.
455    In his behalfe, Ile empty all these Veines,
456    And shed my deere blood drop by drop i'th dust,
457    But I will lift the downfall {Mortimer}
458    As high i'th Ayre, as this Vnthankfull King,
459    As this Ingrate and Cankred {Bullingbrooke}.
460   *<S {Nor}.> Brother, the King hath made your Nephew mad
461    <S {Wor}.> Who strooke this heate vp after I was gone?
462    <S {Hot}.> He will (forsooth) haue all my Prisoners:
463    And when I vrg'd the ransom once againe
464    Of my Wiues Brother, then his cheeke look'd pale,
465    And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
466    Trembling euen at the name of {Mortimer}.
467    <S {Wor}.> I cannot blame him: was he not proclaim'd
468    By {Richard} that dead is, the next of blood?
469    <S {Nor}.> He was: I heard the Proclamation,
470    And then it was, when the vnhappy King
471    (Whose wrongs in vs God pardon) did set forth
472    Vpon his Irish Expedition:
473    From whence he intercepted, did returne
474    To be depos'd, and shortly murthered.
475   *<S {Wor}.> And for whose death, we in the worlds wide mouth
476    Liue scandaliz'd, and fouly spoken of.
      <P e1v>
477    <S {Hot}.> But soft I pray you; did King {Richard} then
478    Proclaime my brother {Mortimer},
479    Heyre to the Crowne?
480    <S {Nor}.> He did, my selfe did heare it.
481    <S {Hot}.> Nay then I cannot blame his Cousin King,
482    That wish'd him on the barren Mountaines staru'd.
483    But shall it be, that you that set the Crowne
484    Vpon the head of this forgetfull man,
485    And for his sake, wore the detested blot
486    Of murtherous subornation? Shall it be,
487    That you a world of curses vndergoe,
488    Being the Agents, or base second meanes,
489    The Cords, the Ladder, or the Hangman rather?
490    O pardon, if that I descend so low,
491    To shew the Line, and the Predicament
492    Wherein you range vnder this subtill King.
493    Shall it for shame, be spoken in these dayes,
494    Or fill vp Chronicles in time to come,
495    That men of your Nobility and Power,
496    Did gage them both in an vniust behalfe
497    (As Both of you, God pardon it, haue done)
498    To put downe {Richard}, that sweet louely Rose,
499    And plant this Thorne, this Canker {Bullingbrooke}?
500    And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
501    That you are fool'd, discarded, and shooke off
502    By him, for whom these shames ye vnderwent?
503    No: yet time serues, wherein you may redeeme
504    Your banish'd Honors, and restore your selues
505    Into the good Thoughts of the world againe.
506    Reuenge the geering and disdain'd contempt
507    Of this proud King, who studies day and night
508    To answer all the Debt he owes vnto you,
509    Euen with the bloody Payment of your deaths:
510    Therefore I say===
511    <S {Wor}.> Peace Cousin, say no more.
512    And now I will vnclaspe a Secret booke,
513    And to your quicke conceyuing Discontents,
514    Ile reade you Matter, deepe and dangerous,
515    As full of perill and aduenturous Spirit,
516    As to o're- walke a Current, roaring loud
517    On the vnstedfast footing of a Speare.
518    <S {Hot}.> If he fall in, good night, or sinke or swimme:
519    Send danger from the East vnto the West,
520    So Honor crosse it from the North to South,
521    And let them grapple: The blood more stirres
522    To rowze a Lyon, then to start a Hare.
523    <S {Nor}.> Imagination of some great exploit,
524    Driues him beyond the bounds of Patience.
525    <S {Hot}.> By heauen, me thinkes it were an easie leap,
526    To plucke bright Honor from the pale- fac'd Moone,
527    Or diue into the bottome of the deepe,
528    Where Fadome- line could neuer touch the ground,
529    And plucke vp drowned Honor by the Lockes:
530    So he that doth redeeme her thence, might weare
531    Without Co- riuall, all her Dignities:
532    But out vpon this halfe- fac'd Fellowship.
533    <S {Wor}.> He apprehends a World of Figures here,
534    But not the forme of what he should attend:
535    Good Cousin giue me audience for a- while,
536    And list to me.
537    <S {Hot}.> I cry you mercy.
538    <S {Wor}.> Those same Noble Scottes
539    That are your Prisoners.
540    <S {Hot}.> Ile keepe them all.
541    By heauen, he shall not haue a Scot of them:
542    No, if a Scot would saue his Soule, he shall not.
543    Ile keepe them, by this Hand.
544    <S {Wor}.> You start away,
545    And lend no eare vnto my purposes.
546    Those Prisoners you shall keepe.
547    <S {Hot}.> Nay, I will: that's flat:
548    He said, he would not ransome {Mortimer}:
549    Forbad my tongue to speake of {Mortimer}.
550    But I will finde him when he lyes asleepe,
551    And in his eare, Ile holla {Mortimer}.
552    Nay, Ile haue a Starling shall be taught to speake
553    Nothing but {Mortimer}, and giue it him,
554    To keepe his anger still in motion.
555    <S {Wor}.> Heare you Cousin: a word.
556    <S {Hot}.> All studies heere I solemnly defie,
557    Saue how to gall and pinch this {Bullingbrooke},
558    And that same Sword and Buckler Prince of Wales.
559    But that I  thinke his Father loues him not,
560    And would be glad he met with some mischance,
561    I would haue poyson'd him with a pot of Ale.
562    <S {Wor}.> Farewell Kinsman: Ile talke to you
563    When you are better temper'd to attend.
564   *<S {Nor}.> Why what a Waspe- tongu'd & impatient foole
565    Art thou, to breake into this Womans mood,
566    Tying thine eare to no tongue but thine owne?
567   *<S {Hot}.> Why look you, I am whipt & scourg'd with rods,
568    Netled, and stung with Pismires, when I heare
569    Of this vile Politician {Bullingbrooke}.
570    In {Richards} time: What de'ye call the place?
571    A plague vpon't, it is in Gloustershire:
572    'Twas, where the madcap Duke his Vncle kept,
573    His Vncle Yorke, where I first bow'd my knee
574    Vnto this King of Smiles, this {Bullingbrooke}:
575    When you and he came backe from Rauenspurgh.
576    <S {Nor}.> At Barkley Castle.
577    <S {Hot}.> You say true:
578    Why what a caudie deale of curtesie,
579    This fawning Grey- hound then did proffer me,
580    Looke when his infant Fortune came to age,
581    And gentle {Harry Percy}, and kinde Cousin:
582    O, the Diuell take such Couzeners, God forgiue me,
583    Good Vncle tell your tale, for I haue done.
584    <S {Wor}.> Nay, if you haue not, too't againe,
585    Wee'l stay your leysure.
586    <S {Hot}.> I haue done insooth.
587    <S {Wor}.> Then once more to your Scottish Prisoners.
588    Deliuer them vp without their ransome straight,
589    And make the {Dowglas} sonne your onely meane
590    For powres in Scotland: which for diuers reasons
591    Which I shall send you written, be assur'd
592    Will easily be granted you, my Lord.
593    Your Sonne in Scotland being thus imploy'd,
594    Shall secretly into the bosome creepe
595    Of that same noble Prelate, well belou'd,
596    The Archbishop.
597    <S {Hot}.> Of Yorke, is't not?
598    <S {Wor}.> True, who beares hard
599    His Brothers death at {Bristow}, the Lord {Scroope}.
600    I speake not this in estimation,
601    As what I thinke might be, but what I know
602    Is ruminated, plotted, and set downe,
603    And onely stayes but to behold the face
604    Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
605    <S {Hot}.> I smell it:
606    Vpon my life, it will do wond'rous well.
607    <S {Nor}.> Before the game's a- foot, thou still  let'st slip.
608    <S {Hot}.> Why, it cannot choose but be a Noble plot,
      <P e2>
609    And then the power of Scotland, and of Yorke
610    To ioyne with {Mortimer}, Ha.
611    <S {Wor}.> And so they shall.
612    <S {Hot}.> Infaith it is exceedingly well aym'd.
613    <S {Wor}.> And 'tis no little reason bids vs speed,
614    To saue our heads, by raising of a Head:
615    For, beare our selues as euen as we can,
616    The King will alwayes thinke him in our debt,
617    And thinke, we thinke our selues vnsatisfied,
618    Till he hath found a time to pay vs home.
619    And see already, how he doth beginne
620    To make vs strangers to his lookes of loue.
621    <S {Hot}.> He does, he does; wee'l be reueng'd on him.
622    <S {Wor}.> Cousin, farewell. No further go in this,
623    Then I by Letters shall direct your course
624    When time is ripe, which will be sodainly:
625    Ile steale to {Glendower}, and loe, {Mortimer},
626    Where you, and {Dowglas}, and our powres at once,
627    As I will fashion it, shall happily meete,
628    To beare our fortunes in our owne strong armes,
629    Which now we hold at much vncertainty.
630   *<S {Nor}.> Farewell good Brother, we shall thriue, I trust.
631    <S {Hot}.> Vncle, adieu: O let the houres be short,
632   *Till fields, and blowes, and grones, applaud our sport.  <D {Exit}>
633    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
634    <D {Enter a Carrier with a Lanterne in his hand}.>
635   *<S 1.{Car}.> Heigh- ho, an't be not foure by the day, Ile be
636   *hang'd. {Charles waine} is ouer the new Chimney, and yet
637    our horse not packt. What Ostler?
638    <S {Ost}.> Anon, anon.
639   *<S 1.{Car}.> I prethee Tom, beate Cuts Saddle, put a few
640   *Flockes in the point: the poore Iade is wrung in the wi-thers,
641    out of all cesse.
642    <D {Enter another Carrier}.>
643   *<S 2.{Car}.> Pease and Beanes are as danke here as a Dog,
644   *and this is the next way to giue poore Iades the Bottes:
645   *This house is turned vpside downe since {Robin} the Ostler
646    dyed.
647   *<S 1.{Car}.> Poore fellow neuer ioy'd since the price of oats
648    rose, it was the death of him.
649   *<S 2.{Car}.> I thinke this is the most villanous house in al
650    London rode for Fleas: I am stung like a Tench.
651   *<S 1.{Car}.> Like a Tench? There is ne're a King in Chri-stendome,
652   *could be better bit, then I haue beene since the
653    first Cocke.
654   *<S 2.{Car}.> Why, you will allow vs ne're a Iourden, and
655   *then we leake in your Chimney: and your Chamber- lye
656    breeds Fleas like a Loach.
657   *<S 1.{Car}.> What Ostler, come away, and be hangd: come
658    away.
659   *<S 2.{Car}.> I haue a Gammon of Bacon, and two razes of
660    Ginger, to be deliuered as farre as Charing- crosse.
661   *<S 1.{Car}.> The Turkies in my Pannier are quite starued.
662   *What Ostler? A plague on thee, hast thou neuer an eye in
663   *thy head? Can'st not heare? #And t'were not as good a
664   *deed as drinke, to break the pate of thee, I am a very Vil-laine.
665    Come and be hang'd, hast no faith in thee?
666    <D {Enter Gads- hill}.>
667    <S {Gad}.> Good- morrow Carriers. What's #a clocke?
668    <S {Car}.> I thinke it be two #a clocke.
669   *<S {Gad}.> I prethee lend me thy Lanthorne to see my Gel-ding
670    in the stable.
671   *<S 1.{Car}.> Nay soft I pray ye, I know a trick worth two
672    of that.
673    <S {Gad}.> I prethee lend me thine.
674   *<S 2.{Car}.> #I, when, canst tell? Lend mee thy Lanthorne
675    (quoth- a) marry Ile see thee hang'd first.
676   *<S {Gad}.> Sirra Carrier: What time do you mean to come
677    to London?
678   *<S 2.{Car}.> Time enough to goe to bed with a Candle, I
679   *warrant thee. Come neighbour {Mugges}, wee'll call vp
680   *the Gentlemen, they will along with company, for they
681    haue great charge.  <D {Exeunt}>
682    <D {Enter Chamberlaine}.>
683    <S {Gad}.> What ho, Chamberlaine?
684    <S {Cham}.> At hand quoth Pick- purse.
685   *<S {Gad}.> That's euen as faire, as at hand quoth the Cham-berlaine:
686   *For thou variest no more from picking of Pur-ses,
687   *then giuing direction, doth from labouring. Thou
688    lay'st the plot, how.
689   *<S {Cham}.> Good morrow Master {Gads- Hill}, it holds cur-rant
690   *that I told you yesternight. There's a Franklin in the
691   *wilde of Kent, hath brought three hundred Markes with
692   *him in Gold: I heard him tell it to one of his company last
693   *night at Supper; a kinde of Auditor, one that hath abun-dance
694   *of charge too (God knowes what) they are vp al-ready,
695   *and call for Egges and Butter. They will away
696    presently.
697   *<S {Gad}.> Sirra, if they meete not with S[aint]. Nicholas Clarks,
698    Ile giue thee this necke.
699   *<S {Cham}.> No, Ile none of it: I prythee  keep  that for the
700   *Hangman, for I know thou worshipst S[aint]. Nicholas as tru-ly
701    as a man of falshood may.
702   *<S {Gad}.> What talkest thou to me of the Hangman? If I
703   *hang, Ile make a fat payre of Gallowes. For, if I hang,
704   *old Sir {Iohn} hangs with mee, and thou know'st hee's no
705   *Starueling. Tut, there are other Troians that y dream'st
706   *not of, the which (for sport sake) are content to doe the
707   *Profession some grace; that would (if matters should bee
708   *look'd into) for their owne Credit sake, make all Whole.
709   *I am ioyned with no Foot- land- Rakers, No Long- staffe
710   *six- penny strikers, none of these mad Mustachio- purple- hu'd- Maltwormes,
711   *but with Nobility, and Tranquilitie;
712   *Bourgomasters, and great Oneyers, such as can holde in,
713   *such as will strike sooner then speake; and speake sooner
714   *then drinke, and drinke sooner then pray: and yet I lye,
715   *for they pray continually vnto their Saint the Common-wealth;
716   *or rather, not to pray to her, but prey on her: for
717    they ride vp & downe on her, and make hir their Boots.
718   *<S {Cham}.> What, the Commonwealth their Bootes? Will
719    she hold out water in foule way?
720   *<S {Gad}.> She will, she will; Iustice hath liquor'd her. We
721   *steale as in a Castle, cocksure: we haue the receit of Fern-seede,
722    we walke inuisible.
723   *<S {Cham}.> Nay, I thinke rather, you are more beholding
724   *to the Night, then to the Fernseed, for your walking in-uisible.
725   _
726    <S {Gad}.> Giue me thy hand.
727    Thou shalt haue a share in our purpose,
728    As I am a true man.
729    <S {Cham}.> Nay, rather let mee haue it, as you are a false
730    Theefe.
731   *<S {Gad}.> Goe #too: {Homo} is a common name to all men.
732   *Bid the Ostler bring the Gelding out of the stable. Fare-well,
733    ye muddy Knaue.  <D {Exeunt}.>

738    <S {Prin}.> Stand close.
739    <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
740    <S {Fal}.> {Poines}, {Poines}, and be hang'd {Poines}.
741   *<S {Prin}.> Peace ye fat- kidney'd Rascall, what a brawling
742    dost thou keepe.
743    <S {Fal}.> What {Poines}. {Hal}?
744   *<S {Prin}.> He is walk'd vp to the top of the hill, Ile go seek
745    him.
746   *<S {Fal}.> I am accurst to rob in that Theefe company: that
747   *Rascall hath remoued my Horse, and tied him I know not
748   *where. If I trauell but foure foot by the squire further #a
749   *foote, I shall breake my winde. Well, I doubt not but
750   *to dye a faire death for all this, if I scape hanging for kil-ling
751   *that Rogue, I haue forsworne his company hourely
752   *any time this two and twenty yeare, & yet I am bewitcht
753   *with the Rogues company. If the Rascall haue not giuen
754   *me medicines to make me loue him, Ile be hang'd; it could
755   *not be else: I haue drunke Medicines. {Poines}, {Hal}, a
756   *Plague vpon you both. {Bardolph}, {Peto}: Ile starue ere I
757   *rob #a foote further. #And 'twere not as good a deede as to
758   *drinke, to turne True- man, and to leaue these Rogues, I
759   *am the veriest Varlet that euer chewed with a Tooth.
760   *Eight yards of vneuen ground, is threescore & ten miles
761   *afoot with me: and the stony- hearted Villaines knowe it
762   *well enough. A plague vpon't, when Theeues cannot be
763    true one to another.  <D {They Whistle}.>
764   *Whew: a plague light vpon you all. Giue my Horse you
765    Rogues: giue me my Horse, and be hang'd.
766   *<S {Prin}.> Peace ye fat guttes, lye downe, lay thine eare
767   *close to the ground, and list if thou can heare the tread of
768    Trauellers.
769   *<S {Fal}.> Haue you any Leauers to lift me vp again being
770   *downe? Ile not beare mine owne flesh so far afoot again,
771   *for all the coine in thy Fathers Exchequer. What a plague
772    meane ye to colt me thus?
773   *<S {Prin}.> Thou ly'st, thou art not colted, thou art vncolted.
774   *<S {Fal}.> I prethee good Prince {Hal}, help me to my horse,
775    good Kings sonne.
776    <S {Prin}.> Out you Rogue, shall I be your Ostler?
777   *<S {Fal}.> Go hang thy selfe in thine owne heire- apparant- Garters:
778   *If I be tane, Ile peach for this: and I haue not
779   *Ballads made on all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a Cup of
780   *Sacke be my poyson: when a iest is so forward, & #a foote
781    too, I hate it.
782    <D {Enter Gads- hill}.>
783    <S {Gad}.> Stand.
784    <S {Fal}.> So I do against my #will.
785    <S {Poin}.> O 'tis our Setter, I know his voyce:
786    {Bardolfe}, what newes?
787   *<S {Bar}.> Case ye, case ye; on with your Vizards, there's
788   *mony of the Kings comming downe the hill, 'tis going
789    to the Kings Exchequer.
790   *<S {Fal}.> You lie you rogue, 'tis going to the Kings Tauern.
791    <S {Gad}.> There's enough to make vs all.
792    <S {Fal}.> To be hang'd.
793   *<S {Prin}.> You foure shall front them in the narrow Lane:
794   *{Ned} and I, will walke lower; if they scape from your en-counter,
795    then they light on vs.
796    <S {Peto}.> But how many be of them?
797    <S {Gad}.> Some eight or ten.
798    <S {Fal}.> Will they not rob vs?
799    <S {Prin}.> What, a Coward Sir {Iohn} Paunch?
800   *<S {Fal}.> Indeed I am not {Iohn of Gaunt} your Grandfather;
801    but yet no Coward, {Hal}.
802    <S {Prin}.> Wee'l leaue that to the proofe.
803   *<S {Poin}.> Sirra Iacke,  thy horse stands behinde the hedg,
804   *when thou need'st him, there thou shalt finde him. Fare-well,
805    and stand fast.
806    <S {Fal}.> Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang'd.
807    <S {Prin}.> {Ned}, where are our disguises?
808    <S {Poin}.> Heere hard by: Stand close.
809   *<S {Fal}.> Now my Masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
810    euery man to his businesse.
811    <D {Enter Trauellers}.>
812   *<S {Tra}.> Come Neighbor: the boy shall leade our Horses
813   *downe the hill: Wee'l walke a- foot #a while, and ease our
814    Legges.
815    <S {Theeues}.> Stay.
816    <S {Tra}.> Iesu blesse vs.
817   *<S {Fal}.> Strike down with them, cut the villains throats;
818   *#a whorson Caterpillars: Bacon- fed Knaues, they hate vs
819    youth; downe with them, fleece them.
820    <S {Tra}.> O, we are vndone, both we and ours for euer.
821   *<S {Fal}.> Hang ye gorbellied knaues, are you vndone? No
822   *ye Fat Chuffes, I would your store were heere. On Ba-cons,
823   *on, what ye knaues? Yong men must liue, you are
824    Grand Iurers, are ye? Wee'l iure ye ifaith.
825    <D {Heere they rob them, and binde them. Enter the}
826    {Prince and Poines}.>
827   *<S {Prin}.> The Theeues haue bound the True- men: Now
828   *could thou and I rob the Theeues, and go merily to Lon-don,
829   *it would be argument for a Weeke, Laughter for a
830    Moneth, and a good iest for euer.
831    <S {Poynes}.> Stand close, I heare them comming.
832    <D {Enter Theeues againe}.>
833   *<S {Fal}.> Come my Masters, let vs share, and then to horsse
834   *before day: and the Prince and Poynes bee not two ar-rand
835   *Cowards, there's no equity stirring. There's no moe
836    valour in that Poynes, than in a wilde Ducke.
837    <S {Prin}.> Your money.
838    <S {Poin}.> Villaines.
839   *<D {As they are sharing, the} Prince {and} Poynes {set vpon them}.
840    {They all run away, leauing the booty behind them}.>
841   *<S {Prince}.> Got with much ease. Now merrily to Horse:
842   *The Theeues are scattred, and possest with fear so strong-ly,
843   *that they dare not meet each other: each takes his fel-low
844   *for an Officer. Away good {Ned}, {Falstaffe} sweates to
845   *death, and Lards the leane earth as he walkes along: #wer't
846    not for laughing, I should pitty him.
847    <S {Poin}.> How the Rogue roar'd.  <D {Exeunt}.>
848    <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
849    <D {Enter Hotspurre solus, reading a Letter}.>
850   *{But for mine owne part, my Lord. I could bee well contented to}
851    {be there, in respect of the loue I beare your house}.
      <P e3>
852   *He could be contented: Why is he not then? in respect of
853   *the loue he beares our house. He shewes in this, he loues
854   *his owne Barne better then he loues our house. Let me
855   *see some more. {The purpose you vndertake is dangerous}.
856   *Why that's certaine: 'Tis dangerous to take a Colde, to
857   *sleepe, to drinke: but I tell you (my Lord foole) out of
858   *this Nettle, Danger; we plucke this Flower, Safety. {The}
859   *{purpose you vndertake is dangerous, the Friends you haue na-med}
860   *{vncertaine, the Time it selfe vnsorted, and your whole}
861   *{Plot too  light, for the counterpoize of so great an Opposition}.
862   *Say you so, say you so: I say vnto you againe, you are a
863   *shallow cowardly Hinde, and you Lye. What a lacke-braine
864   *is this? I protest, our plot is as good a plot as euer
865   *was laid; our Friend true and constant: A good Plotte,
866   *good Friends, and full of expectation: An excellent plot,
867   *very good Friends. What a Frosty- spirited rogue is this?
868   *Why, my Lord of Yorke commends the plot, and the
869   *generall course of the action. By this hand, if I were now
870   *by this Rascall, I could braine him with his Ladies Fan.
871   *Is there not my Father, my Vncle, and my Selfe, Lord
872   *{Edmund Mortimer}, my Lord of {Yorke}, and {Owen Glendour}?
873   *Is there not besides, the {Dowglas}? Haue I not all their let-ters,
874   *to meete me in Armes by the ninth of the next Mo-neth?
875   *and are they not some of them set forward already?
876   *What a Pagan Rascall is this? An Infidell. Ha, you shall
877   *see now in very sincerity of Feare and Cold heart, will he
878   *to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could
879   *diuide my selfe, and go to buffets, for mouing such a dish
880   *of skim'd Milk with so honourable an Action. Hang him,
881   *let him tell the King we are prepared. I will set forwards
882    to night.
883    <D {Enter his Lady}.>
884   *How now Kate, I must leaue you within these two hours.
885    <S {La}.> O my good Lord, why are you thus alone?
886    For what offence haue I this fortnight bin
887    A banish'd woman from my {Harries} bed?
888    Tell me (sweet Lord) what is't that takes from thee
889    Thy stomacke, pleasure, and thy golden sleepe?
890    Why dost thou bend thine eyes vpon the earth?
891    And start so often when thou sitt'st alone?
892    Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheekes?
893    And giuen my Treasures and my rights of thee,
894    To thicke- ey'd musing, and curst melancholly?
895    In my faint- slumbers, I by thee haue watcht,
896    And heard thee murmore tales of Iron Warres:
897    Speake tearmes of manage to thy bounding Steed,
898    Cry courage to the field. And thou hast talk'd
899    Of Sallies, and Retires; Trenches, Tents,
900    Of Palizadoes, Frontiers, Parapets,
901    Of Basiliskes, of Canon, Culuerin,
902    Of Prisoners ransome, and of Souldiers slaine,
903    And all the current of a headdy fight.
904    Thy spirit within thee hath beene so at Warre,
905    And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleepe,
906    That beds of sweate hath stood vpon thy Brow,
907    Like bubbles in a late- disturbed Streame;
908    And in thy face strange motions haue appear'd,
909    Such as we see when men restraine their breath
910   *On some great sodaine #hast. O what portents are these?
911    Some heauie businesse hath my Lord in hand,
912    And I must know it: else he loues me not.
913    <S {Hot}.> What ho; Is {Gilliams} with the Packet gone?
914    <S {Ser}.> He is my Lord, an houre agone.
915   *<S {Hot}.> Hath {Butler} brought those horses fro[m] the Sheriffe?
916    <S {Ser}.> One horse, my Lord, he brought euen now.
917    <S {Hot}.> What Horse? A Roane, a crop eare, is it not.
918    <S {Ser}.> It is my Lord.
919   *<S {Hot}.> That Roane shall be my Throne. Well, I will
920   *backe him straight. {Esperance}, bid {Butler} lead him forth
921    into the Parke.
922    <S {La}.> But heare you, my lord.
923    <S {Hot}.> What say'st thou my Lady?
924    <S {La}.> What is it carries you away?
925    <S {Hot}.> Why, my horse (my Loue) my horse.
926   *<S {La}.> Out you mad- headed Ape, a Weazell hath not
927   *such a deale  of Spleene, as you are tost with. In sooth Ile
928   *know your businesse {Harry}, that I will. I feare my Bro-ther
929   *{Mortimer} doth stirre about his Title, and  hath sent
930    for you to line his enterprize. But if you go===
931    <S {Hot}.> So farre #a foot, I shall be weary, Loue.
932   *<S {La}.> Come, come, you Paraquito, answer me directly
933   *vnto this question, that I shall aske. Indeede Ile breake
934    thy little finger {Harry}, if thou wilt not tel me true.
935    <S {Hot}.> Away, away you trifler: Loue, I loue thee not,
936    I care not for thee {Kate}: this is no world
937    To play with Mammets, and to tilt with lips.
938    We must haue bloodie Noses, and crack'd Crownes,
939    And passe them currant too. Gods me, my horse.
940   *What say'st thou {Kate}? what wold'st thou haue with me?
941    <S {La}.> Do ye not loue me? Do ye not indeed?
942    Well, do not then. For since you loue me not,
943    I will not loue my selfe. Do you not loue me?
944    Nay, tell me if thou speak'st in iest, or no.
945    <S {Hot}.> Come, wilt thou see me ride?
946    And when I am #a horsebacke, I will sweare
947    I loue thee infinitely. But hearke you {Kate},
948    I must not haue you henceforth, question me,
949    Whether I go: nor reason whereabout.
950    Whether I must, I must: and to conclude,
951    This Euening must I leaue  thee, gentle {Kate}.
952    I know you wise, but yet no further wise
953    Then {Harry Percies} wife. Constant you are,
954    But yet a woman: and for secrecie,
955    No Lady closer. For I will beleeue
956    Thou wilt not vtter what thou do'st not know,
957    And so farre wilt I trust thee, gentle Kate.
958    <S {La}.> How so farre?
959    <S {Hot}.> Not an inch further. But harke you {Kate},
960    Whither I go, thither shall you go too:
961    To day will I set forth, to morrow you.
962    Will this content you {Kate}?
963    <S {La}.> It must of force.  <D {Exeunt}>
964    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
965    <D {Enter Prince and Poines}.>
966   *<S {Prin}.> {Ned}, prethee come out of that fat roome, & lend

969   *<S {Prin}.> With three or foure Logger- heads, amongst 3.
970   *or fourescore Hogsheads. I haue sounded the verie base
971   *string of humility. Sirra, I am sworn brother to a leash of
972   *Drawers, and can call them by their names, as {Tom, Dicke},
973   *and {Francis}. They take it already vpon their confidence,
974   *that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the King
975   *of Curtesie: telling me flatly I am no proud Iack like {Fal-staffe},
976   *but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, and
977   *when I am King of England, I shall command al the good
978   *Laddes in East- cheape. They call drinking deepe, dy-ing
979   *Scarlet; and when you breath in your watering, then
      <P e3v>
980   *they cry hem, and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am
981   *so good a proficient in one quarter of an houre, that I can
982   *drinke with any Tinker in his owne Language during my
983   *life. I tell thee {Ned}, thou hast lost much honor, that thou

1085  *<S {Fal}.> You Rogue, heere's Lime in this Sacke too: there
1086  *is nothing but Roguery to be found in Villanous man; yet
1087  *a Coward is worse then a Cup of Sack with lime. A vil-lanous
1088  *Coward, go thy wayes old Iacke, die when thou
1089  *wilt, if manhood, good manhood be not forgot vpon the
1090  *face of the earth, then am I a shotten Herring: there liues
1091  *not three good men vnhang'd in England, & one of them
1092  *is fat, and growes old, God helpe the while, a bad world I
1093  *say. I would I were a Weauer, I could sing all manner of
1094   songs. A plague of all Cowards, I say still.
1095   <S {Prin}.> How now Woolsacke, what mutter you?
1096  *<S {Fal}.> A Kings Sonne? If I do not beate thee out of thy
1097  *Kingdome with a dagger of Lath, and driue all thy Sub-iects
1098  *afore thee like a flocke of Wilde- geese, Ile neuer
1099   weare haire on my face more. You Prince of Wales?
1100  *<S {Prin}.> Why you horson round man? what's the matter?
1101  *<S {Fal}.> Are you not a Coward? Answer me to that, and
1102   {#Poines} there?
1103  *<S {Prin}.> Ye fat paunch, #and yee call mee Coward, Ile
1104   stab thee.
1105  *<S {Fal}.> I call thee Coward? Ile see thee damn'd ere I call
1106  *#the Coward: but I would giue a thousand pound I could
1107  *run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the
1108  *shoulders, you care not who sees your backe: Call you
      <P e4><C H>
1109  *that backing of your friends? a plague vpon such bac-king:
1110  *giue me them that will face me. Giue me a Cup
1111   of Sack, I am a Rogue if I drunke to day.
1112  *<S {Prin}.> O Villaine, thy Lippes are scarce wip'd, since
1113   thou drunk'st last.
1114   <S {Falst}.> All's one for that.  <D {He drinkes}.>
1115   A plague of all Cowards still, say I.
1116   <S {Prince}.> What's the matter?
1117  *<S {Falst}.> What's the matter? here be foure of vs, haue
1118   ta'ne a thousand pound this Morning.
1119   <S {Prince}.> Where is it, {Iack}? where is it?
1120  *<S {Falst}.> Where is it? taken from vs, it is: a hundred
1121   vpon poore foure of vs.
1122   <S {Prince}.> What, a hundred, man?
1123  *<S {Falst}.> I am a Rogue, if I were not at halfe Sword with
1124  *a dozen of them two houres together. I haue scaped by
1125  *miracle. I am eight times thrust through the Doublet,
1126  *foure through the Hose, my Buckler cut through and
1127  *through, my Sword hackt like a Hand- saw, {ecce signum}.
1128  *I neuer dealt better since I was a man: all would not doe.
1129  *A plague of all Cowards: let them speake; if they speake
1130  *more or lesse then truth, they are villaines, and the sonnes
1131   of darknesse.
1132   <S {Prince}.> Speake sirs, how was it?
1133   <S {Gad}.> We foure set vpon some dozen.
1134   <S {Falst}.> Sixteene, at least, my Lord.
1135   <S {Gad}.> And bound them.
1136   <S {Peto}.> No, no, they were not bound.
1137  *<S {Falst}.> You Rogue, they were bound, euery man of
1138   them, or I am a Iew else, an Ebrew Iew.
1139  *<S {Gad}.> As we were sharing, some sixe or seuen fresh men
1140   set vpon vs.
1141  *<S {Falst}.> And  vnbound the rest, and then come in the
1142   other.
1143   <S {Prince}.> What, fought yee with them all?
1144  *<S {Falst}.> All? I know not what yee call all: but if I
1145  *fought not with fiftie of them, I am a bunch of Radish:
1146  *if there were not two or three and fiftie vpon poore olde
1147   {Iack}, then am I no two- legg'd Creature.
1148  *<S {Poin}.> Pray Heauen, you haue not murthered some of
1149   them.
1150  *<S {Falst}.> Nay, that's past praying for, I haue pepper'd
1151  *two of them: Two I am sure I haue payed, two Rogues
1152  *in Buckrom Sutes. I tell thee what, {Hal}, if I tell thee a
1153  *Lye, spit in my face, call me Horse: thou knowest my olde
1154  *word: here I lay, and thus I bore my point; foure Rogues
1155   in Buckrom let driue at me.
1156   <S {Prince}.> What, foure? thou sayd'st but two, euen now.
1157   <S {Falst}.> Foure {Hal}, I told thee foure.
1158   <S {Poin}.> #I, #I, he said foure.
1159  *<S {Falst}.> These foure came all a- front, and mainely thrust
1160  *at me; I made no more adoe, but tooke all their seuen
1161   points in my Targuet, thus.
1162   <S {Prince}.> Seuen? why there were but foure, euen now.
1163   <S {Falst}.> In buckrom.
1164   <S {Poin}.> #I, foure, in Buckrom Sutes.
1165   <S {Falst}.> Seuen, by these Hilts, or I am a Villaine else.
1166  *<S {Prin}.> Prethee let him alone, we shall haue more anon.
1167   <S {Falst}.> Doest thou heare me, {Hal}?
1168   <S {Prin}.> #I, and marke thee too, {Iack}.
1169  *<S {Falst}.> Doe so, for it is worth the listning #too: these
1170   nine in Buckrom, that I told thee of.
1171   <S {Prin}.> So, two more alreadie.
1172   <S {Falst}.> Their Points being broken.
1173   <S {Poin}.> Downe fell his Hose.
1174  *<S {Falst}.> Began to giue me ground: but I followed me
1175  *close, came in foot and hand; and with a thought, seuen of
1176   the eleuen I pay'd.
1177  *<S {Prin}.> O monstrous! eleuen Buckrom men growne
1178   out of two?
1179  *<S {Falst}.> But as the Deuill would haue it, three mis- be-gotten
1180  *Knaues, in Kendall Greene, came at my Back, and
1181  *let driue at me; for it was so darke, {Hal}, that thou could'st
1182   not see thy Hand.
1183  *<S {Prin}.> These Lyes are like the Father that begets them,
1184  *grosse as a Mountaine, open, palpable. Why thou Clay-brayn'd
1185  *Guts, thou Knotty- pated Foole, thou Horson ob-scene
1186   greasie Tallow Catch.
1187  *<S {Falst}.> What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the
1188   truth, the truth?
1189  *<S {Prin}.> Why, how could'st thou know these men in
1190  *Kendall Greene, when it was so darke, thou could'st not
1191  *see thy Hand? Come, tell vs your reason: what say'st thou
1192   to this?
1193   <S {Poin}.> Come, your reason {Iack}, your reason.
1194  *<S {Falst}.> What, vpon compulsion? No: were I at the
1195  *Strappado, or all the Racks in the World, I would not
1196  *tell you on compulsion. Giue you a reason on compulsi-on?
1197  *If Reasons were as plentie as Black- berries, I would
1198   giue no man a Reason vpon compulsion, I.
1199  *<S {Prin}.> Ile be no longer guiltie of this sinne. This san-guine
1200  *Coward, this Bed- presser, this Hors- back- breaker,
1201   this huge Hill of Flesh.
1202  *<S {Falst}.> Away you Starueling, you Elfe- skin, you dried
1203  *Neats tongue, Bulles- pissell, you stocke- fish: O for breth
1204  *to vtter. What is like thee? You Tailors yard, you sheath
1205   you Bow- case, you vile standing tucke.
1206  *<S {Prin}.> Well, breath a- while, and then to't againe: and
1207  *when thou hast tyr'd thy selfe in base comparisons, heare
1208   me speake but thus.
1209   <S {Poin}.> Marke Iacke.
1210  *<S {Prin}.> We two, saw you foure set on foure and bound
1211  *them, and were Masters of their Wealth: mark now how
1212  *a plaine Tale shall put you downe. Then did we two, set
1213  *on you foure, and with a word, outfac'd you from your
1214  *prize, and haue it: yea, and can shew it you in the House.
1215  *And {Falstaffe}, you caried your Guts away as nimbly, with
1216  *as quicke dexteritie, and roared for mercy, and still ranne
1217  *and roar'd, as euer I heard Bull- Calfe. What a Slaue art
1218  *thou, to hacke thy sword as thou hast done, and then say
1219  *it was in fight. What trick? what deuice? what starting
1220  *hole canst thou now find out, to hide thee from this open
1221   and apparant shame?
1222  *<S {Poines}.> Come, let's heare Iacke: What tricke hast
1223   thou now?
1224  *<S {Fal}.> I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why heare
1225  *ye my Masters, was it for me to kill the Heire apparant?
1226  *Should I turne vpon the true Prince? Why, thou knowest
1227  *I am as valiant as {Hercules}: but beware Instinct, the Lion
1228  *will not touch the true Prince: Instinct is a great matter.
1229  *I was a Coward on Instinct: I shall thinke the better of
1230  *my selfe, and thee, during my life: I, for a valiant Lion,
1231  *and thou for a true Prince. But Lads, I am glad you haue
1232  *the Mony. Hostesse, clap to the doores: watch to night,
1233  *pray to morrow. Gallants, Lads, Boyes, Harts of Gold,
1234  *all the good Titles of Fellowship come to you. What,
1235   shall we be merry? shall we haue a Play extempory.
1236  *<S {Prin}.> Content, and the argument shall be, thy runing
1237   away.
1238   <S {Fal}.> #A, no more of that {Hall}, #and thou louest me.
1239   <D {Enter Hostesse}>
1240   <S {Host}.> My Lord, the Prince?
      <P e4v>
1241  *<S {Prin}.> How now my Lady the Hostesse, what say'st
1242   thou to me?
1243  *<S {Hostesse}.> Marry, my Lord, there is a Noble man of the
1244  *Court at doore would speake with you: hee sayes, hee
1245   comes from your Father.
1246  *<S {Prin}.> Giue him as much as will make him a Royall
1247   man, and send him backe againe to my Mother.
1248   <S {Falst}.> What manner of man is hee?
1249   <S {Hostesse}.> An old man.
1250  *<S {Falst}.> What doth Grauitie out of his Bed at Midnight?
1251   Shall I giue him his answere?
1252   <S {Prin}.> Prethee doe {Iacke}.
1253   <S {Falst}.> 'Faith, and Ile send him packing.  <D {Exit}.>
1254  *<S {Prince}.> Now Sirs: you fought faire; so did you
1255  *{#Peto}, so did you {Bardol}: you are Lyons too, you ranne
1256  *away vpon instinct: you will not touch the true Prince;
1257   no, fie.
1258   <S {Bard}.> 'Faith, I ranne when I saw others runne.
1259  *<S {Prin}.> Tell mee now in earnest, how came {Falstaffes}
1260   Sword so hackt?
1261  *<S {Peto}.> Why, he hackt it with his Dagger, and said, hee
1262  *would sweare truth out of England, but hee would make
1263  *you beleeue it was done in fight, and perswaded vs to doe
1264   the like.
1265  *<S {Bard}.> Yea, and to tickle our Noses with Spear- grasse,
1266  *to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
1267  *with it, and sweare it was the blood of true men. I did
1268  *that I did not this seuen yeeres before, I blusht to heare
1269   his monstrous deuices.
1270  *<S {Prin}.> O Villaine, thou stolest a Cup of Sacke eigh-teene
1271  *yeeres agoe, and wert taken with the manner, and
1272  *euer since thou hast blusht extempore: thou hadst fire
1273  *and sword on thy side, and yet thou ranst away; what
1274   instinct hadst thou for it?
1275  *<S {Bard}.> My Lord, doe you see these Meteors? doe you
1276   behold these Exhalations?
1277   <S {Prin}.> I doe
1278   <S {Bard}.> What thinke you they portend?
1279   <S {Prin}.> Hot Liuers, and cold Purses.
1280   <S {Bard}.> Choler, my Lord, if rightly taken.
1281   <S {Prin}.> No, if rightly taken, Halter.
1282   <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
1283  *Heere comes leane {Iacke}, heere comes bare- bone. How
1284  *now my sweet Creature of Bombast, how long is't agoe,
1285   {Iacke}, since thou saw'st thine owne Knee?
1286  *<S {Falst}.> My owne Knee? When I was about thy yeeres
1287  *({Hal}) I was not an Eagles Talent in the Waste, I could
1288  *haue crept into any Aldermans Thumbe- Ring: a plague
1289  *of sighing and griefe, it blowes a man vp like a Bladder.
1290  *There's villanous Newes abroad; heere was Sir {Iohn}
1291  *{Braby} from your Father; you must goe to the Court in
1292  *the Morning. The same mad fellow of the North, {Percy};
1293  *and hee of Wales, that gaue {Amamon} the Bastinado,
1294  *and made {Lucifer} Cuckold, and swore the Deuill his true
1295  *Liege- man vpon the Crosse of a Welch- hooke; what a
1296   plague call you him?
1297   <S {Poin}.> O, {Glendower}.
1298  *<S {Falst}.> {Owen, Owen}; the same, and his Sonne in Law
1299  *{Mortimer}, and old {Northumberland}, and the sprightly
1300  *Scot of Scots, {Dowglas}, that runnes #a Horse- backe vp a
1301   Hill perpendicular.
1302  *<S {Prin}.> Hee that rides at high speede, and with a Pistoll
1303   kills a Sparrow flying.
1304   <S {Falst}.> You haue hit it.
1305   <S {Prin}.> So did he neuer the Sparrow.
1306  *<S {Falst}.> Well, that Rascall hath good mettall in him,
1307   hee will not runne.
1308  *<S {Prin}.> Why, what a Rascall art thou then, to prayse him
1309   so for running?
1310  *<S {Falst}.> #A Horse- backe (ye Cuckoe) but #a foot hee will
1311   not budge a foot.
1312   <S {Prin}.> Yes {Iacke}, vpon instinct.
1313  *<S {Falst}.> I grant ye, vpon instinct: Well, hee is there too,
1314  *and one {Mordake}, and a thousand blew- Cappes more.
1315  *{#Worcester} is stolne away by Night: thy Fathers Beard is
1316  *turn'd white with the Newes; you may buy Land now
1317   as cheape as stinking Mackrell.
1318  *<S {Prin}.> Then 'tis like, if there come a hot Sunne, and this
1319  *ciuill buffetting hold, wee shall buy Maiden- heads as
1320   they buy Hob- nayles, by the Hundreds.
1321  *<S {Falst}.> By the Masse Lad, thou say'st true, it is like wee
1322  *shall haue good trading that way. But tell me {Hal}, art
1323  *not thou horrible afear'd? thou being Heire apparant,
1324  *could the World picke thee out three such Enemyes a-gaine,
1325  *as that Fiend {Dowglas}, that Spirit {Percy}, and that
1326  *Deuill {Glendower}? Art not thou horrible afraid? Doth
1327   not thy blood thrill at it?
1328   <S {Prin}.> Not a whit: I lacke some of thy instinct.
1329  *<S {Falst}.> Well, thou wilt be horrible chidde to morrow,
1330  *when thou commest to thy Father: if thou doe loue me,
1331   practise an answere.
1332  *<S {Prin}.> Doe thou stand for my Father, and examine mee
1333   vpon the particulars of my Life.
1334  *<S {Falst}.> Shall I? content: This Chayre shall bee my
1335  *State, this Dagger my Scepter, and this Cushion my
1336   Crowne.
1337  *<S {Prin}.> Thy State is taken for a Ioyn'd- Stoole, thy Gol-den
1338  *Scepter for a Leaden Dagger, and thy precious rich
1339   Crowne, for a pittifull bald Crowne.
1340  *<S {Falst}.> Well, #and the fire of Grace be not quite out of
1341  *thee now shalt thou be moued. Giue me a Cup of Sacke
1342  *to make mine eyes looke redde, that it may be thought I
1343  *haue wept, for I must speake in passion, and I will doe it
1344   in King {Cambyses} vaine.
1345   <S {Prin}.> Well, heere is my Legge.
1346   <S {Falst}.> And heere is my speech: stand aside Nobilitie.
1347   <S {Hostesse}.> This is excellent sport, yfaith.
1348  *<S {Falst}.> Weepe not, sweet Queene, for trickling teares
1349   are vaine.
1350  *<S {Hostesse}.> O the Father, how hee holdes his counte-nance?
1351  _
1352  *<S {Falst}.> For Gods sake Lords, conuey my trustfull Queen,
1353   For teares doe stop the floud- gates of her eyes.
1354  *<S {Hostesse}.> O rare, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
1355   Players, as euer I see.
1356  *<S {Falst}.> Peace good Pint- pot, peace good Tickle- braine.
1357  *{Harry}, I doe not onely maruell where thou spendest thy
1358  *time; but also, how thou art accompanied: For though
1359  *the Camomile, the more it is troden, the faster it growes;
1360  *yet Youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it weares.
1361  *Thou art my Sonne: I haue partly thy Mothers Word,
1362  *partly my Opinion; but chiefely, a villanous tricke of
1363  *thine Eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether Lippe, that
1364  *doth warrant me. If then thou be Sonne to mee, heere
1365  *lyeth the point: why, being Sonne to me, art thou so
1366  *poynted at? Shall the blessed Sonne of Heauen proue a
1367  *Micher, and eate Black- berryes? a question not to bee
1368  *askt. Shall the Sonne of England proue a Theefe, and
1369  *take Purses? a question to be askt. There is a thing,
1370  *{Harry}, which thou hast often heard of, and it is knowne to
      <P e5>
1371  *many in our Land, by the Name of Pitch: this Pitch (as
1372  *ancient Writers doe report) doth defile; so doth the com-panie
1373  *thou keepest: for {Harry}, now I doe not speake to
1374  *thee in Drinke, but in Teares; not in Pleasure, but in Pas-sion;
1375  *not in Words onely, but in Woes also: and yet
1376  *there is a vertuous man, whom I haue often noted in thy
1377   companie, but I know not his Name.
1378  *<S {Prin}.> What manner of man, #and it like your Ma-iestie?
1379  _
1380  *<S {Falst}.> A goodly portly man yfaith, and a corpulent,
1381  *of a chearefull Looke, a pleasing Eye, and a most noble
1382  *Carriage, and as I thinke, his age some fiftie, or (byrlady)
1383  *inclining to threescore; and now I remember mee, his
1384  *Name is {Falstaffe}: if that man should be lewdly giuen,
1385  *hee deceiues mee; for {Harry}, I see Vertue in his Lookes.
1386  *If then the Tree may be knowne by the Fruit, as the Fruit
1387  *by the Tree, then peremptorily I speake it, there is Vertue
1388  *in that {Falstaffe}: him keepe with, the rest banish. And
1389  *tell mee now, thou naughtie Varlet, tell mee, where hast
1390   thou beene this moneth?
1391  *<S {Prin}.> Do'st thou speake like a King? doe thou stand
1392   for mee, and Ile play my Father.
1393  *<S {Falst}.> Depose me: if thou do'st it halfe so grauely, so
1394  *maiestically, both in word and matter, hang me vp by the
1395   heeles for a Rabbet- sucker, or a Poulters Hare.
1396   <S {Prin}.> Well, heere I am set.
1397   <S {Falst}.> And heere I stand: iudge my Masters.
1398   <S {Prin}.> Now {Harry}, whence come you?
1399   <S {Falst}.> My Noble Lord, from East- cheape.
1400   <S {Prin}.> The complaints I heare of thee, are grieuous.
1401  *<S {Falst}.> Yfaith, my Lord, they are false: Nay, Ile tickle
1402   ye for a young Prince.
1403  *<S {Prin}.> Swearest thou, vngracious Boy? henceforth
1404  *ne're looke on me: thou art violently carryed away from
1405  *Grace: there is a Deuill haunts thee, in the likenesse of a
1406  *fat old Man; a Tunne of Man is thy Companion: Why
1407  *do'st thou conuerse with that Trunke of Humors, that
1408  *Boulting- Hutch of Beastlinesse, that swolne Parcell of
1409  *Dropsies, that huge Bombard of Sacke, that stuft Cloake-bagge
1410  *of Guts, that rosted Manning Tree Oxe with the
1411  *Pudding in his Belly, that reuerend Vice, that grey ini-quitie,
1412  *that Father Ruffian, that Vanitie in yeeres? where-in
1413  *is he good, but to taste Sacke, and drinke it? wherein
1414  *neat and cleanly, but to carue a Capon, and eat it? where-in
1415  *Cunning, but in Craft? wherein Craftie, but in Villa-nie?
1416  *wherein Villanous, but in all things? wherein wor-thy,
1417   but in nothing?
1418  *<S {Falst}.> I would your Grace would take  me with you:
1419   whom meanes your Grace?
1420  *<S {Prince}.> That villanous abhominable mis- leader of
1421   Youth, {Falstaffe}, that old white- bearded Sathan.
1422   <S {Falst}.> My Lord, the man I know.
1423   <S {Prince}.> I know thou do'st.
1424  *<S {Falst}.> But to say, I know more harme in him then in
1425  *my selfe, were to say more then I know. That hee is olde
1426  *(the more the pittie) his white hayres doe witnesse it:
1427  *but that hee is (sauing your reuerence) a Whore- ma-ster,
1428  *that I vtterly deny. If Sacke and Sugar bee a fault,
1429  *Heauen helpe the Wicked: if to be olde and merry, be a
1430  *sinne, then many an olde Hoste that I know, is damn'd:
1431  *if to be fat, be to be hated, then {Pharaohs} leane Kine are
1432  *to be loued. No, my good Lord, banish {Peto}, banish
1433  *{Bardolph}, banish {Poines}: but for sweete {Iacke Falstaffe},
1434  *kinde {Iacke Falstaffe}, true {Iacke Falstaffe}, valiant {Iacke Fal-staffe},
1435  *and therefore more valiant, being as hee is olde {Iack}
1436  *{Falstaffe}, banish not him thy {Harryes} companie, banish
1437  *not him thy {Harryes} companie; banish plumpe {Iacke}, and
1438   banish all the World.
1439   <S {Prince}.> I doe, I will.
1440   <D {Enter Bardolph running}.>
1441  *<S {Bard}.> O, my Lord, my Lord, the Sherife, with a most
1442   monstrous Watch, is at the doore.
1443  *<S {Falst}.> Out you Rogue, play out the Play: I haue much
1444   to say in the behalfe of that {Falstaffe}.
1445   <D {Enter the Hostesse}.>
1446   <S {Hostesse}.> O, my Lord, my Lord.
1447  *<S {Falst}.> Heigh, heigh, the Deuill rides vpon a Fiddle-sticke:
1448   what's the matter?
1449  *<S {Hostesse}.> The Sherife and all the Watch are at the
1450  *doore: they are come to search the House, shall I let
1451   them in?
1452  *<S {Falst}.> Do'st thou heare {Hal}, neuer call a true peece of
1453  *Gold a Counterfeit: thou art essentially made, without
1454   seeming so.
1455  *<S {Prince}.> And thou a naturall Coward, without in-stinct.
1456  _
1457  *<S {Falst}.> I deny your {Maior}: if you will deny the
1458  *Sherife, so: if not, let him enter. If I become not a Cart
1459  *as well as another man, a plague on my bringing vp: I
1460  *hope I shall as soone be strangled with a Halter, as ano-ther.
1461  _
1462  *<S {Prince}.> Goe hide thee behinde the Arras, the rest
1463  *walke vp aboue. Now my Masters, for a true Face and
1464   good Conscience.
1465  *<S {Falst}.> Both which I haue had: but their date is out,
1466   and therefore Ile hide me.  <D {Exit}.>
1467   <S {Prince}.> Call in the Sherife.
1468   <D {Enter Sherife and the Carrier}.>
1469  *<S {Prince}.> Now Master Sherife, what is your #will with
1470   mee?
1471  *<S {She}.> First pardon me, my Lord. A Hue and Cry hath
1472   followed certaine men vnto this house.
1473   <S {Prince}.> What men?
1474  *<S {She}.> One of them is well knowne, my gracious Lord,
1475   a grosse fat man.
1476   <S {Car}.> As fat as Butter.
1477   <S {Prince}.> The man, I doe assure you, is not heere,
1478   For I my selfe at this time haue imploy'd him:
1479   And Sherife, I will engage my word to thee,
1480   That I will by to morrow Dinner time,
1481   Send him to answere thee, or any man,
1482   For any thing he shall be charg'd withall:
1483   And so let me entreat you, leaue the house.
1484   <S {She}.> I will, my Lord: there are two Gentlemen
1485   Haue in this Robberie lost three hundred Markes.
1486   <S {Prince}.> It may be so: if he haue robb'd these men,
1487   He shall be answerable: and so farewell.
1488   <S {She}.> Good Night, my Noble Lord.
1489   <S {Prince}.> I thinke it is good Morrow, is it not?
1490  *<S {She}.> Indeede, my Lord, I thinke it be two #a Clocke.
1491   <D {Exit}.>
1492  *<S {Prince}.> This oyly Rascall is knowne as well as Poules:
1493   goe call him forth.
1494  *<S {Peto}.> {Falstaffe}? fast asleepe behinde the Arras, and
1495   snorting like a Horse.
1496  *<S {Prince}.> Harke, how hard he fetches breath: search his
1497   Pockets.
      <P e5v>
1498   <D {He searcheth his Pockets, and findeth}
1499   {certaine Papers}.>
1500   <S {Prince}.> What hast thou found?
1501   <S {Peto}.> Nothing but Papers, my Lord.
1502   <S {Prince}.> Let's see, what be they? reade them.
1503   <S {Peto}.> Item, a Capon.  ii.s.ii.d.
1504   Item, Sawce  iiii.d.
1505   Item, Sacke, two Gallons.  v.s.viii.d.
1506   Item, Anchoues and Sacke after Supper.  ii.s.vi.d.
1507   Item, Bread.  ob.
1508  *<S {Prince}.> O monstrous, but one halfe penny- worth of
1509  *Bread to this intollerable deale of Sacke? What there is
1510  *else, keepe close, wee'le reade it at more aduantage: there
1511  *let him sleepe till day. Ile to the Court in the Morning:
1512  *Wee must all to the Warres, and thy place shall be hono-rable.
1513  *Ile procure this fat Rogue a Charge of Foot,
1514  *and I know his death will be a Match of Twelue- score.
1515  *The Money shall be pay'd backe againe with aduantage.
1516  *Be with me betimes in the Morning: and so good mor-row
1517   {Peto}.
1518   <S {Peto}.> Good morrow, good my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1519   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1520   <D {Enter Hotspurre, Worcester, Lord Mortimer},
1521   {Owen Glendower}.>
1522   <S {Mort}.> These promises are faire, the parties sure,
1523   And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1524   <S {Hotsp}.> Lord {Mortimer}, and Cousin {Glendower},
1525   Will you sit downe?
1526   And Vnckle {Worcester}; a plague vpon it,
1527   I haue forgot the Mappe.
1528   <S {Glend}.> No, here it is:
1529   Sit Cousin {Percy}, sit good Cousin {Hotspurre}:
1530  *For by that Name, as oft as {Lancaster} doth speake of you,
1531   His Cheekes looke pale, and with a rising sigh,
1532   He wisheth you in Heauen.
1533  *<S {Hotsp}.> And you in #Hell, as oft as he heares {Owen Glen-dower}
1534   spoke of.
1535   <S {Glend}.> I cannot blame him: At my Natiuitie,
1536   The front of Heauen was full of fierie shapes,
1537   Of burning Cressets: and at my Birth,
1538   The frame and foundation of the Earth
1539   Shak'd like a Coward.
1540  *<S {Hotsp}.> Why so it would haue done at the same season,
1541  *if your Mothers Cat had but kitten'd, though your selfe
1542   had neuer beene borne.
1543   <S {Glend}.> I say the Earth did shake when I was borne.
1544   <S {Hotsp}.> And I say the Earth was not of my minde,
1545   If you suppose, as fearing you, it shooke.
1546  *<S {Glend}.> The heauens were all on fire, the Earth did
1547   tremble.
1548   <S {Hotsp}.> Oh, then the Earth shooke
1549   To see the Heauens on fire,
1550   And not in feare of your Natiuitie.
1551   Diseased Nature oftentimes breakes forth
1552   In strange eruptions; and the teeming Earth
1553   Is with a kinde of Collick pincht and vext,
1554   By the imprisoning of vnruly Winde
1555   Within her Wombe: which for enlargement striuing,
1556   Shakes the old Beldame Earth, and tombles downe
1557   Steeples, and mosse- growne Towers. At your Birth,
1558   Our Grandam Earth, hauing this distemperature,
1559   In passion shooke.
1560   <S {Glend}.> Cousin: of many men
1561   I doe not beare these Crossings: Giue me leaue
1562   To tell you once againe, that at my Birth
1563   The front of Heauen was full of fierie shapes,
1564   The Goates ranne from the Mountaines, and the Heards
1565   Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields:
1566   These signes haue markt me extraordinarie,
1567   And all the courses of my Life doe shew,
1568   I am not in the Roll of common men.
1569   Where is the Liuing, clipt in with the Sea,
1570  *That chides the Bankes of England, Scotland, and Wales,
1571   Which calls me Pupill, or hath read to me?
1572   And bring him out, that is but Womans Sonne,
1573   Can trace me in the tedious wayes of #Art,
1574   And hold me pace in deepe experiments.
1575   <S {Hotsp}.> I thinke there's no man speakes better Welsh:
1576   Ile to Dinner.
1577   <S {Mort}.> Peace cousin {Percy}, you will make him mad.
1578   <S {Glend}.> I can call Spirits from the vastie Deepe.
1579   <S {Hotsp}.> Why so can I, or so can any man:
1580   But will they come, when you doe call for them?
1581  *<S {Glend}.> Why, I can teach thee, Cousin, to command the
1582   Deuill.
1583  *<S {Hotsp}.> And I can teach thee, Cousin, to shame the Deuil,
1584   By telling truth. {Tell truth, and shame the Deuill}.
1585   If thou haue power to rayse him, bring him hither,
1586   And Ile be sworne, I haue power to shame him hence.
1587   Oh, while you liue, tell truth, and shame the Deuill.
1588  *<S {Mort}.> Come, come, no more of this vnprofitable
1589   Chat.
1590   <S {Glend}.> Three times hath {Henry Bullingbrooke} made head
1591   Against my Power: thrice from the Banks of Wye,
1592   And sandy- bottom'd Seuerne, haue I hent him
1593   Bootlesse home, and Weather- beaten backe.
1594   <S {Hotsp}.> Home without Bootes,
1595   And in foule Weather too,
1596   How scapes he Agues in the Deuils name?
1597   <S {Glend}.> Come, heere's the Mappe:
1598   Shall wee diuide our Right,
1599   According to our three- fold order ta'ne?
1600   <S {Mort}.> The Arch- Deacon hath diuided it
1601   Into three Limits, very equally:
1602   England, from Trent, and Seuerne. hitherto,
1603   By South and East, is to my part assign'd:
1604   All Westward, Wales, beyond the Seuerne shore,
1605   And all the fertile Land within that bound,
1606   To {Owen Glendower}: And deare Couze, to you
1607   The remnant Northward,  lying off from Trent.
1608   And our Indentures Tripartite are drawne:
1609   Which being sealed enterchangeably,
1610   (A Businesse that this Night may execute)
1611   To morrow, Cousin {Percy}, you and I,
1612   And my good Lord of Worcester, will set forth,
1613   To meete your Father, and the Scottish Power,
1614   As is appointed vs at Shrewsbury.
1615   My Father {Glendower} is not readie yet,
1616   Nor shall wee neede his helpe these foureteene dayes:
1617   Within that space, you may haue drawne together
1618   Your Tenants, Friends, and neighbouring Gentlemen.
1619   <S {Glend}.> A shorter time shall send me to you, Lords:
1620   And in my Conduct shall your Ladies come,
1621   From whom you now must steale, and take no leaue,
1622   For there will be a World of Water shed,
      <P e6>
1623   Vpon the parting of your Wiues and you.
1624  *<S {Hotsp}.> Me thinks my Moity, North from Burton here,
1625   In quantitie equals not one of yours:
1626   See, how this Riuer comes me cranking in,
1627   And cuts me from the best of all my Land,
1628   A huge halfe Moone, a monstrous Cantle out.
1629   Ile haue the Currant in this place damn'd vp,
1630   And here the smug and Siluer Trent shall runne,
1631   In a new Channell, faire and euenly:
1632   It shall not winde with such a deepe indent,
1633   To rob me of so rich a Bottome here.
1634   <S {Glend}.> Not winde? it shall, it must, you see it doth.
1635   <S {Mort}.> Yea, but marke how he beares his course,
1636   And runnes me vp, with like aduantage on the other side,
1637   Gelding the opposed Continent as much,
1638   As on the other side it takes from you.
1639   <S {Worc}.> Yea, but a little Charge will trench him here,
1640   And on this North side winne this Cape of Land,
1641   And then he runnes straight and euen.
1642   <S {Hotsp}.>  Ile haue it so, a little Charge will doe it.
1643   <S {Glend}.> Ile not haue it alter'd.
1644   <S {Hotsp}.> Will not you?
1645   <S {Glend}.> No, nor you shall not.
1646   <S {Hotsp}.> Who shall say me nay?
1647   <S {Glend}.> Why, that will I.
1648  *<S {Hotsp}.> let me not vnderstand you then, speake it in
1649   Welsh.
1650   <S {Glend}.> I can speake English, Lord, as well as you:
1651   For I was trayn'd vp in the English Court;
1652   Where, being but young, I framed to the Harpe
1653   Many an English Dittie, louely well,
1654   And gaue the Tongue a helpefull Ornament;
1655   A Vertue that was neuer seene in you.
1656   <S {Hotsp}.> Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart,
1657   I had rather be a Kitten, and cry mew,
1658   Then one of these same Meeter Ballad- mongers:
1659   I had rather heare a Brazen Candlestick turn'd,
1660   Or a dry Wheele grate on the Axle- tree,
1661   And that would set my teeth nothing #an edge,
1662   Nothing so much, as mincing Poetrie;
1663   'Tis like the forc't gate of a shuffling Nagge.
1664   <S {Glend}.> Come, you shall haue Trent turn'd.
1665   <S {Hotsp}.> I doe not care: Ile giue thrice so much Land
1666   To any well- deseruing friend;
1667   But in the way of Bargaine, marke ye me,
1668   Ile cauill on the ninth part of a hayre.
1669   Are the Indentures drawne? shall we be gone?
1670   <S {Glend}.> The Moone shines faire,
1671   You may away by Night:
1672   Ile haste the Writer; and withall,
1673   Breake with your Wiues, of your departure hence:
1674   I am afraid my Daughter will runne madde,
1675   So much she doteth on her {Mortimer}.  <D {Exit}.>
1676  *<S {Mort}.> Fie, Cousin {Percy}, how you crosse my Fa-ther.
1677  _
1678   <S {Hotsp}.> I cannot chuse: sometime he angers me,
1679   With telling me of the Moldwarpe and the Ant,
1680   Of the Dreamer {Merlin}, and his Prophecies;
1681   And of a Dragon, and a finne- lesse Fish,
1682   A clip- wing'd Griffin, and a moulten Rauen,
1683   A couching Lyon, and a ramping Cat,
1684   And such a deale of skimble- skamble Stuffe,
1685   As puts me from my Faith. I tell you what,
1686   He held me last Night, at least, nine howres,
1687   In reckning vp the seuerall Deuils Names,
1688   That were his Lacqueyes:
1689   I cry'd hum, and well, goe #too,
1690   But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
1691   As a tyred Horse, a rayling Wife,
1692   Worse then a smoakie House. I had rather liue
1693   With Cheese and Garlick in a Windmill farre,
1694   Then feede on Cates, and haue him talke to me,
1695   In any Summer- House in Christendome.
1696   <S {Mort}.> In faith he was a worthy Gentleman,
1697   Exceeding well read, and profited,
1698   In strange Concealements:
1699   Valiant as a Lyon, and wondrous affable,
1700   And as Bountifull, as Mynes of India.
1701   Shall I tell you, Cousin,
1702   He holds your temper in a high respect,
1703   And curbes himselfe,  euen of his naturall scope,
1704   When you doe crosse his humor: 'faith he does.
1705   I warrant you, that man is not aliue,
1706   Might so haue tempted him, as you haue done,
1707   Without the taste of danger, and reproofe:
1708   But doe not vse it oft, let me entreat you.
1709   <S {Worc}.> In faith, my Lord, you are too wilfull blame,
1710   And since your comming hither, haue done enough,
1711   To put him quite besides his patience.
1712   You must needes learne, Lord, to amend this fault:
1713  *Though sometimes it shew Greatnesse, Courage, Blood,
1714   And that's the dearest grace it renders you;
1715   Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh Rage,
1716   Defect of Manners, want of Gouernment,
1717   Pride, Haughtinesse, Opinion, and Disdaine:
1718   The least of which, haunting a Nobleman,
1719   Loseth mens hearts, and leaues behinde a stayne
1720   Vpon the beautie of all parts besides,
1721   Beguiling them of commendation.
1722   <S {Hotsp}.> Well, I am school'd:
1723   Good- manners be your speede;
1724   Heere come your Wiues, and let vs take our leaue.
1725   <D {Enter Glendower, with the Ladies}.>
1726   <S {Mort}.> This is the deadly spight, that angers me,
1727   My Wife can speake no English, I no Welsh.
1728  *<S {Glend}.> My Daughter weepes, shee'le not part with you,
1729   Shee'le be a Souldier too, shee'le to the Warres.
1730  *<S {Mort}.> Good Father tell her, that she and my Aunt {Percy}
1731   Shall follow in your Conduct speedily.
1732   <D {Glendower speakes to her in Welsh, and she an-sweres}
1733   {him in the same}.>
1734   <S {Glend}.> Shee is desperate heere:
1735   A peeuish selfe- will'd Harlotry,
1736   One that no perswasion can doe good vpon.
1737   <D {The Lady speakes in Welsh}.>
1738   <S {Mort}.> I vnderstand  thy Lookes: that pretty Welsh
1739  *Which thou powr'st down from these swelling Heauens,
1740   I am too perfect in: and but for shame,
1741   In such a parley should I answere thee.
1742   <D {The Lady againe in welsh}.>
1743   <S {Mort}.> I vnderstand thy Kisses, and thou mine,
1744   And that's a feeling disputation:
1745   But I will neuer be a Truant, Loue,
1746   Till I haue learn'd thy Language: for thy tongue
      <P e6v>
1747   Makes Welsh as sweet as Ditties highly penn'd,
1748   Sung by a faire Queene in a Summers Bowre,
1749   With rauishing Diuision to her Lute.
1750   <S {Glend}.> Nay, if thou melt, then will she runne madde.
1751   <D {The Lady speakes againe in Welsh}.>
1752   <S {Mort}.> O, I am Ignorance it selfe in this.
1753   <S {Glend}.> She bids you,
1754   On the wanton Rushes lay you downe,
1755   And rest your gentle Head vpon her Lappe,
1756   And she will sing the Song that pleaseth you,
1757   And on your Eye- lids Crowne the God of Sleepe,
1758   Charming your blood with pleasing heauinesse;
1759   Making such difference betwixt Wake and Sleepe,
1760   As is the difference betwixt Day and Night,
1761   The houre before the Heauenly Harneis'd Teeme
1762   Begins his Golden Progresse in the East.
1763   <S {Mort}.> With all my heart Ile sit, and heare her sing:
1764   By that time will our Booke, I thinke, be drawne.
1765   <S {Glend}.> Doe so:
1766   And those Musitians that shall play to you,
1767   Hang in the Ayre a thousand Leagues from thence;
1768   And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
1769   <S {Hotsp}.> Come {Kate}, thou art perfect in lying downe:
1770  *Come, quicke, quicke, that I may lay my Head in thy
1771   Lappe.
1772   <S {Lady}.> Goe, ye giddy- Goose.
1773   <D {The Musicke playes}.>
1774  *<S {Hotsp}.> Now I perceiue the Deuill vnderstands Welsh,
1775   And 'tis no maruell he is so humorous:
1776   Byrlady hee's a good Musitian.
1777   <S {Lady}.> Then would you be nothing but Musicall,
1778   For you are altogether gouerned by humors:
1779   Lye still ye Theefe, and heare the Lady sing in Welsh.
1780  *<S {Hotsp}.> I had rather heare (Lady) my Brach howle in
1781   Irish.
1782   <S {Lady}.> Would'st haue thy Head broken?
1783   <S {Hotsp}.> No.
1784   <S {Lady}.> Then be still.
1785   <S {Hotsp}.> Neyther, 'tis a Womans fault.
1786   <S {Lady}.> Now God helpe thee.
1787   <S {Hotsp}.> To the Welsh Ladies Bed.
1788   <S {Lady}.> What's that?
1789   <S {Hotsp}.> Peace, shee sings.
1790   <D {Heere the Lady sings a Welsh Song}.>
1791   <S {Hotsp}.> Come, Ile haue your Song too.
1792   <S {Lady}.> Not mine, in good sooth.
1793   <S {Hotsp}.> Not yours, in good sooth?
1794   You sweare like a Comfit- makers Wife:
1795   Not you, in good sooth; and, as true as I liue;
1796   And, as God shall mend me; and, as sure as day:
1797   And giuest such Sarcenet suretie for thy Oathes,
1798   As if thou neuer walk'st further then Finsbury.
1799   Sweare me, {Kate}, like a Lady, as thou art,
1800   A good mouth- filling Oath: and leaue in sooth,
1801   And such protest of Pepper Ginger- bread,
1802   To Veluet- Guards, and Sunday- Citizens.
1803   Come, sing.
1804   <S {Lady}.> I will not sing.
1805  *<S {Hotsp}.> 'Tis the next way to turne Taylor, or be Red-brest
1806  *teacher: #and the Indentures be drawne, Ile away
1807  *within these two howres: and so come in, when yee
1808   will.  <D {Exit}.>
1809   <S {Glend}.> Come, come, Lord {Mortimer}, you are as slow,
1810   As hot Lord {Percy} is on fire to goe.
1811   By this our Booke is drawne: wee'le but seale,
1812   And then to Horse immediately.
1813   <S {Mort}.> With all my heart.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1814   <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
1815   <D {Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others}.>
1816   <S {King}.> Lords, giue vs leaue:
1817   The Prince of Wales, and I,
1818   Must haue some priuate conference:
1819   But be neere at hand,
1820   For wee shall presently haue neede of you.
1821   <D {Exeunt Lords}.>
1822   I know not whether Heauen will haue it so,
1823   For some displeasing seruice I haue done;
1824   That in his secret Doome, out of my Blood,
1825   Hee'le breede Reuengement, and a Scourge for me:
1826   But thou do'st in thy passages of Life,
1827   Make me beleeue, that thou art onely mark'd
1828   For the hot vengeance, and the Rod of heauen
1829   To punish my Mistreadings. Tell me else,
1830   Could such inordinate and low desires,
1831   Such poore, such bare, such lewd, such meane attempts,
1832   Such barren pleasures, rude societie,
1833   As thou art matcht withall, and grafted #too,
1834   Accompanie the greatnesse of thy blood,
1835   And hold their leuell with thy Princely heart?
1836   <S {Prince}.> So please your Maiesty, I would  I could
1837   Quit all offences with as cleare excuse,
1838   As well as I am doubtlesse I can purge
1839   My selfe of many I am charg'd withall:
1840   Yet such extenuation let me begge,
1841   As in reproofe of many Tales deuis'd,
1842   Which oft the Eare of Greatnesse needes must heare,
1843   By smiling Pick- thankes, and base Newes- mongers;
1844   I may for some things true, wherein my youth
1845   Hath faultie wandred, and irregular,
1846   Finde pardon on my true submission.
1847   <S {King}.> Heauen pardon thee:
1848   Yet let me wonder, {Harry},
1849   At thy affections, which doe hold a Wing
1850   Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
1851   Thy place in Councell thou hast rudely lost,
1852   Which by thy younger Brother is supply'de;
1853   And art almost an alien to the hearts
1854   Of all the Court and Princes of my blood.
1855   The hope and expectation of thy time
1856   Is ruin'd, and the Soule of euery man
1857   Prophetically doe fore- thinke thy fall.
1858   Had I so lauish of my presence beene,
1859   So common hackney'd in the eyes of men,
1860   So stale and cheape to vulgar Company;
1861   Opinion, that did helpe me to the Crowne,
1862   Had still kept loyall to possession,
1863   And left me in reputelesse banishment,
1864   A fellow of no marke, nor likelyhood.
1865   By being seldome seene, I could not stirre,
1866   But like a Comet, I was wondred at,
      <P f1>
1867   That men would tell their Children, This is hee:
1868   Others would say; Where, Which is {Bullingbrooke}.
1869   And then I stole all Courtesie from Heauen,
1870   And drest my selfe in such Humilitie,
1871   That I did plucke Allegeance from mens hearts,
1872   Lowd Showts and Salutations from their mouthes,
1873   Euen in the presence of the Crowned King.
1874   Thus I did keepe my Person fresh and new,
1875   My Presence like a Robe Pontificall,
1876   Ne're seene, but wondred at: and so my State,
1877   Seldome but sumptuous, shewed like a Feast,
1878   And wonne by rarenesse such Solemnitie.
1879   The skipping King hee ambled vp and downe,
1880   With shallow Iesters, and rash Bauin Wits,
1881   Soone kindled, and soone burnt, carded his state,
1882   Mingled his Royaltie with Carping Fooles,
1883   Had his great Name prophaned with their Scornes,
1884   And gaue his Countenance, against his Name,
1885   To laugh at gybing Boyes, and  stand the push
1886   Of euery Beardlesse vaine Comparatiue;
1887   Grew a Companion to the common Streetes,
1888   Enfeoff'd himselfe to Popularitie:
1889   That being dayly swallowed by mens Eyes,
1890   They surfeted with Honey, and began to loathe
1891   The taste of Sweetnesse, whereof a little
1892   More then a little, is by much too much.
1893   So when he had occasion to be seene,
1894   He was but as the Cuckow is in Iune,
1895   Heard, not regarded: seene but with such Eyes,
1896   As sicke and blunted with Communitie,
1897   Affoord no extraordinarie Gaze,
1898   Such as is bent on Sunne- like Maiestie,
1899   When it shines seldome in admiring Eyes:
1900   But rather drowz'd,  and hung their eye- lids downe,
1901   Slept in his Face, and rendred such aspect
1902   As Cloudie men vse to doe to their aduersaries,
1903   Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.
1904   And in that very Line, {Harry}, standest thou:
1905   For thou hast lost thy Princely Priuiledge,
1906   With vile participation. Not an Eye
1907   But is awearie of thy common sight,
1908   Saue mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more:
1909   Which now doth that I would not haue it doe,
1910   Make blinde it selfe with foolish tendernesse.
1911   <S {Prince}.> I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious Lord,
1912   Be more my selfe.
1913   <S {King}.> For all the World,
1914   As thou art to this houre, was {Richard} then,
1915   When I from France set foot at Rauenspurgh;
1916   And euen as I was then, is {Percy} now:
1917   Now by my Scepter, and my Soule to boot,
1918   He hath more worthy interest to the State
1919   Then thou, the shadow of Succession;
1920   For of no Right, nor colour like to Right.
1921   He doth fill fields with Harneis in the Realme,
1922   Turnes head against the Lyons armed Iawes;
1923   And being no more in debt to yeeres, then thou,
1924   Leades ancient Lords, and reuerent Bishops on
1925   To bloody Battailes, and to brusing Armes.
1926   What neuer- dying Honor hath he got,
1927   Against renowned {Dowglas}? whose high Deedes,
1928   Whose hot Incursions, and great Name in Armes,
1929   Holds from all Souldiers chiefe Maioritie,
1930   And Militarie Title Capitall.
1931   Through all the Kingdomes that acknowledge Christ,
1932   Thrice hath the {Hotspur Mars}, in swathing Clothes,
1933   This Infant Warrior, in his Enterprises,
1934   Discomfited great {Dowglas}, ta'ne him once,
1935   Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,
1936   To fill the mouth of deepe Defiance vp,
1937   And shake the peace and safetie of our Throne.
1938   And what say you to this? {Percy, Northumberland},
1939   The Arch- bishops Grace of Yorke, {Dowglas, Mortimer},
1940   Capitulate against vs, and are vp.
1941   But wherefore doe I tell these Newes to thee?
1942   Why, {Harry}, doe I tell thee of my Foes,
1943   Which art my neer'st and dearest Enemie?
1944   Thou, that art like enough, through vassall Feare,
1945   Base Inclination, and the start of Spleene,
1946   To fight against me vnder {Percies} pay,
1947   To dogge his heeles, and curtsie at his frownes,
1948   To shew how much thou art degenerate.
1949   <S {Prince}.> Doe not thinke so, you shall not finde it so:
1950   And Heauen forgiue  them, that so much haue sway'd
1951   Your Maiesties good thoughts away from me:
1952   I will redeeme all this on {Percies} head,
1953   And in the closing of some glorious day,
1954   Be bold to tell you, that I am your Sonne,
1955   When I will weare a Garment all of Blood,
1956   And staine my fauours in a bloody Maske:
1957   Which washt away, shall scowre my shame with it.
1958   And that shall be the day, when ere it lights,
1959   That this same Child of Honor and Renowne.
1960   This gallant {Hotspur}, this all- praysed Knight.
1961   And your vnthought- of {Harry} chance to meet:
1962   For euery Honor sitting on his Helme,
1963   Would they were multitudes, and on my head
1964   My shames redoubled. For the time will come,
1965   That I shall make this Northerne Youth exchange
1966   His glorious Deedes for my Indignities:
1967   {#Percy} is but my Factor, good my Lord,
1968   To engrosse vp glorious Deedes on my behalfe:
1969   And I will call him to so strict account,
1970   That he shall render euery Glory vp,
1971   Yea, euen the sleightest worship of his time,
1972   Or I will teare the Reckoning from his Heart.
1973   This, in the Name of Heauen, I promise here:
1974   The which, if I performe, and doe suruiue,
1975   I doe beseech your Maiestie, may salue
1976   The long- growne Wounds of my intemperature:
1977   If not, the end of Life cancells all Bands,
1978   And I will dye a hundred thousand Deaths,
1979   Ere breake the smallest parcell of this Vow.
1980   <S {King}.> A hundred thousand Rebels dye in this:
1981   Thou shalt haue Charge, and soueraigne trust herein.
1982   <D {Enter Blunt}.>
1983   How now good {Blunt}? thy Lookes are full of speed.
1984  *<S {Blunt}.> So hath the Businesse that I come to speake of.
1985   Lord {Mortimer} of Scotland hath sent word,
1986   That {Dowglas} and the English Rebels met
1987   The eleuenth of this moneth, at Shrewsbury:
1988   A mightie and a fearefull Head they are,
1989   (If Promises be kept on euery hand)
1990   As euer offered foule play in a State.
1991   <S {King}.> The earle of Westmerland set forth to day:
1992   With him my sonne, Lord {Iohn} of Lancaster,
1993   For this aduertisement is fiue dayes old.
1994   On Wednesday next, {Harry} thou shalt set forward:
1995   On thursday, wee our selues will march.
1996   Our meeting is Bridgenorth: and {Harry}, you shall march
      <P f1v>
1997   Through Glocestershire: by which account,
1998   Our Businesse valued some twelue dayes hence,
1999   Our generall Forces at Bridgenorth shall meete.
2000   Our Hands are full of Businesse: let's away,
2001   Aduantage feedes him fat, while men delay.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2002   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2003   <D {Enter Falstaffe and Bardolph}.>
2004  *<S {Falst}.> {Bardolph}, am I not falne away vilely, since this
2005  *last action? doe I not bate? doe I not dwindle? Why
2006  *my skinne hangs about me like an olde Ladies loose
2007  *Gowne: I am withered like an olde Apple {Iohn}. Well,
2008  *Ile repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking:
2009  *I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall haue no
2010  *strength to repent. #And i haue not forgotten what the
2011  *in- side of a Church is made of, I am a Pepper- Corne, a
2012  *Brewers Horse, the in- side of a Church. Company, villa-nous
2013   Company hath beene the spoyle of me.
2014  *<S {Bard}.> Sir {Iohn}, you are so fretfull, you cannot liue
2015   long.
2016  *<S {Falst}.> Why there is it: Come, sing me a bawdy Song,
2017  *make me merry; I was as vertuously giuen, as a Gentle-man
2018  *need to be; vertuous enough, swore little, dic'd not
2019  *aboue seuen times a weeke, went to a Bawdy- house not
2020  *aboue once in a quarter of an houre, payd Money that I
2021  *borrowed, three or foure times; liued well, and in good
2022  *compasse: and now I liue out of all order, out of com-passe.
2023  _
2024  *<S {Bard}.> Why, you are so fat, Sir {Iohn}, that you must
2025  *needes bee out of of all compasse; out all reasonable
2026   compasse, Sir {Iohn}.
2027  *<S {Falst}.> Doe thou amend thy Face, and Ile amend thy
2028  *Life: Thou art our Admirall, thou bearest the Lanterne
2029  *in the Poope, but 'tis in the Nose of thee; thou art the
2030   Knight of the burning Lampe.
2031   <S {Bard}.> Why, Sir {Iohn}, my Face does you no harme.
2032  *<S {Falst}.> No, Ile be sworne: I make as good vse of it, as
2033  *many a man doth of a Deaths- Head, or a {Memento Mori}.
2034  *I neuer see thy Face, but I thinke vpon #Hell fire, and {Diues}
2035  *that liued in Purple; for there he is in his Robes burning,
2036  *burning. If thou wert any way giuen to vertue, I would
2037  *sweare by thy Face; my Oath should bee, {By this Fire}:
2038  *But thou art altogether giuen ouer; and wert indeede,
2039  *but for the Light in thy Face, the Sunne of vtter Darke-nesse.
2040  *When thou ran'st vp Gads- Hill in the Night, to
2041  *catch my Horse, if I did not thinke that thou hadst beene
2042  *an {Ignis fatuus}, or a Ball of Wild- fire, there's no Purchase
2043  *in Money. O, thou art a perpetuall Triumph, an euer-lasting
2044  *Bone- fire- Light: thou hast saued me a thousand
2045  *Markes in Linkes and Torches, walking with thee in the
2046  *Night betwixt Tauerne and Tauerne: But the Sack that
2047  *thou hast drunke me, would haue bought me Lights as
2048  *good cheape, as the dearest Chandlers in Europe. I haue
2049  *maintain'd that Salamander of yours with fire, any time
2050   this two and thirtie yeeres, Heauen reward me for it.
2051   <S {Bard}.> I would my Face were in your Belly.
2052   <S {Falst}.> So should I be sure to be heart- burn'd.
2053   <D {Enter Hostesse}.>
2054  *How now, Dame {Partlet} the Hen, haue you enquir'd yet
2055   who pick'd my Pocket?
2056  *<S {Hostesse}.> Why Sir {Iohn}, what doe you thinke, Sir {Iohn}?
2057  *doe you thinke I keepe Theeues in my House? I haue
2058  *search'd, I haue enquired, so haz my Husband, Man by
2059  *Man, Boy by Boy, Seruant by Seruant: the tight of a
2060   hayre was neuer lost in my house before.
2061  *<S {Falst}.> Ye lye Hostesse: {Bardolph} was shau'd, and lost
2062  *many a hayre; and Ile be sworne my Pocket was pick'd:
2063   goe to, you are a Woman, goe.
2064  *<S {Hostesse}.> Who I? I defie thee: I was neuer call'd so
2065   in mine owne house before.
2066   <S {Falst}.>  Goe to, I know you well enough.
2067  *<S {Hostesse}.> No, sir {Iohn}, you doe not know me, Sir {Iohn}:
2068  *I know you, Sir {Iohn}: you owe me Money, Sir {Iohn}, and
2069  *now you picke a quarrell, to beguile me of it: I bought
2070   you a dozen of Shirts to your Backe.
2071  *<S {Falst}.> Doulas, filthy Doulas: I haue giuen them
2072  *away to Bakers Wiues, and they haue made Boulters of
2073   them.
2074  *<S {Hostesse}.> Now as I am a true Woman, Holland of eight
2075  *shillings an Ell: You owe Money here besides, Sir {Iohn},
2076  *for your Dyet, and by- Drinkings, and Money lent you,
2077   foure and twentie pounds.
2078   <S {Falst}.> Hee had his part of it, let him pay.
2079  *<S {Hostesse}.> Hee? alas hee is poore, hee hath no-thing.
2080  _
2081  *<S {Falst}.> How? Poore? Looke vpon his Face: What call
2082  *you Rich? Let them coyne his Nose, let them coyne his
2083  *Cheekes, Ile not pay a Denier. What, will you make a
2084  *Younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine Inne,
2085  *but I shall haue my Pocket pick'd? I haue lost a Seale- Ring
2086   of my Grand- fathers, worth fortie  marke.
2087  *<S {Hostesse}.> I haue heard the Prince tell him, I know not
2088   how oft, that that Ring was Copper.
2089  *<S {Falst}.> How? the Prince is a Iacke, a Sneake- Cuppe:
2090  *#and if hee were heere, I would cudgell him like a Dogge,
2091   if hee would say so.
2092   <D {Enter the Prince marching, and Falstaffe meets}
2093   {him, playing on his Trunchion}
2094   {like a Fife}.>
2095  *<S {Falst}.> How now Lad? is the Winde in that Doore?
2096   Must we all march?
2097   <S {Bard}.> Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
2098   <S {Hostesse}.>  My Lord, I pray you heare me.
2099  *<S {Prince}.> What say'st thou, Mistresse {Quickly}? How
2100  *does thy Husband? I loue him well, hee is an honest
2101   man.
2102   <S {Hostesse}.> Good,   my Lord, heare mee.
2103   <S {Falst}.> Prethee let her alone, and list to mee.
2104   <S {Prince}.> What say'st thou, {Iacke}?
2105  *<S {Falst}.> The other Night I fell asleepe heere behind the
2106  *Arras, and had my Pocket pickt: this House is turn'd
2107   Bawdy- house, they picke Pockets.
2108   <S {Prince}.> What didst thou lose, {Iacke}?
2109  *<S {Falst}.> Wilt thou beleeue me, {Hal}? Three or foure Bonds
2110  *of fortie pound apeece, and a Seale- Ring of my Grand- fathers.
2111  _
2112   <S {Prince}.> A Trifle, some eight- penny matter.
2113  *<S {Host}.> So I told him, my Lord; and I said, I heard your
2114  *Grace say so: and (my Lord) hee speakes most vilely of
2115  *you, like a foule- mouth'd man as hee is, and said, hee
2116   would cudgell you.
2117   <S {Prince}.> What hee did not?
2118  *<S {Host}.> There's neyther Faith, Truth, nor Woman- hood
2119   in me else.
      <P f2><C B>
2120  *<S {Falst}.>  There's no more faith in thee then a stu'de Prune;
2121  *nor no more truth in thee, then in a drawne Fox: and for
2122  *Wooman- hood, Maid- marian may be the Deputies wife
2123   of the Ward to thee. Go you nothing: go.
2124   <S {Host}.> Say, what thing? what thing?
2125  *<S {Falst}.> What thing? why a thing to thanke heauen on.
2126  *<S {Host}.> I am no thing to thanke heauen on, I wold thou
2127  *shouldst know it:  I am an honest mans wife: and setting
2128   thy Knighthood aside, thou art a knaue to call me so.
2129  *<S {Falst}.> Setting thy woman- hood aside, thou art a beast
2130   to say otherwise.
2131   <S {Host}.> Say, what beast, thou knaue thou?
2132   <S {Fal}.> What beast? Why an Otter.
2133   <S {Prin}.> An Otter, sir {Iohn}? Why an Otter?
2134  *<S {Fal}.> Why? She's neither fish nor flesh; a man knowes
2135   not where to haue her.
2136  *<S {Host}.> Thou art vniust man in saying so; thou, or anie
2137   man knowes where to haue me, thou knaue thou.
2138  *<S {Prince}.> Thou say'st true Hostesse, and he slanders thee
2139   most grossely.
2140  *<S {Host}.> So he doth you, my Lord, and sayde this other
2141   day, You ought him a thousand pound.
2142   <S {Prince}.> Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
2143  *<S {Falst}.> A thousand pound {Hal}? A Million. Thy loue is
2144   worth a Million: thou ow'st me thy loue.
2145  *<S {Host}.> Nay my Lord, he call'd you Iacke, and said hee
2146   would cudgell you.
2147   <S {Fal}.> Did I, {Bardolph}?
2148   <S {Bar}.> Indeed Sir {Iohn}, you said so.
2149   <S {Fal}.> Yea, if he said my Ring was Copper.
2150  *<S {Prince}.> I say 'tis Copper. Dar'st thou bee as good as
2151   thy word now?
2152  *<S {Fal}.> Why {Hal}? thou know'st, as thou art but a man, I
2153  *dare: but, as thou art a Prince, I feare thee, as I feare the
2154   roaring of the Lyons Whelpe.
2155   <S {Prince}.> And why not as the Lyon?
2156  *<S {Fal}.> The King himselfe is to bee feared as the Lyon:
2157  *Do'st thou thinke Ile feare thee, as I feare thy Father? nay
2158   if I do, let my Girdle breake.
2159  *<S {Prin}.> O, if it should, how would thy guttes fall about
2160  *thy knees. But sirra: There's no roome for Faith, Truth,
2161  *nor Honesty, in this bosome of thine: it is all fill'd vppe
2162  *with Guttes and Midriffe. Charge an honest Woman
2163  *with picking thy pocket? Why thou horson impudent
2164  *imbost Rascall, if there were any thing in thy Pocket but
2165  *Tauerne Recknings, {Memorandums} of Bawdie- houses,
2166  *and one poore peny- worth of Sugar- candie to make thee
2167  *long- winded: if thy pocket were enrich'd with anie o-ther
2168  *iniuries but these, I am a Villaine: And yet you will
2169  *stand to it, you will not Pocket vp wrong. Art thou not
2170   asham'd?
2171  *<S {Fal}.> Do'st thou heare {Hal}? Thou know'st in the state
2172  *of Innocency, {Adam} fell: and what should poore {Iacke}
2173  *{Falstaffe} do, in the dayes of Villany? Thou seest, I haue
2174  *more flesh then another man, and therefore more frailty.
2175   You confesse then you pickt my Pocket?
2176   <S {Prin}.> It appeares so by the Story.
2177   <S {Fal}.> Hostesse, I forgiue thee:
2178   Go make ready Breakfast, loue thy Husband,
2179   Looke to thy Seruants, and cherish thy Guests:
2180   Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason:
2181   Thou seest, I am pacified still.
2182   Nay, I prethee be gone.
2183   <D {Exit Hostesse}.>
2184  *Now {Hal}, to the newes at Court for the Robbery, Lad?
2185   How is that answered?
2186   <S {Prin}.> O my sweet Beefe:
2187   I must still be good Angell to thee.
2188   The Monie is paid backe againe.
2189  *<S {Fal}.> O, I do not like that paying backe, 'tis a double
2190   Labour.
2191  *<S {Prin}.> I am good Friends with my Father, and may do
2192   anything.
2193  *<S {Fal}.> Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou do'st,
2194   and do it with vnwash'd hands too.
2195   <S {Bard}.> Do my Lord.
2196   <S {Prin}.> I haue procured thee {Iacke}, A Charge of Foot.
2197  *<S {Fal}.> I would it had beene of Horse. Where shal I finde
2198  *one that can steale well? O, for a fine theefe of two and
2199  *twentie, or thereabout: I am heynously vnprouided. Wel
2200  *God be thanked for these Rebels, they offend none but
2201   the Vertuous. I laud them, I praise them.
2202   <S {Prin}.> {Bardolph}.
2203   <S {Bar}.> My Lord.
2204  *<S {Prin}.> Go beare this Letter to Lord {Iohn} of Lancaster
2205  *To my Brother {Iohn}.  This to my Lord of Westmerland,
2206   Go {Peto}, to horse: for thou, and I,
2207   Haue thirtie miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
2208   {Iacke}, meet me tomorrow in the Temple Hall
2209   At two #a clocke in the afternoone,
2210   There shalt thou know thy Charge, and there receiue
2211   Money and Order for their Furniture.
2212   The Land is burning, {Percie} stands on hye,
2213   And either they, or we must lower lye.
2214   <S {Fal}.> Rare words! braue world.
2215   Hostesse, my breakfast, come:
2216   Oh, I could wish this Tauerne were my drumme.
2217   <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
2218   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scoena Prima}.>
2219   <D {Enter Harrie Hotspurre, Worcester},
2220   {and Dowglas}.>
2221   <S {Hot}.> Well said, my Noble Scot, if speaking truth
2222   In this fine Age, were not thought flatterie,
2223   Such attribution should the {Dowglas} haue,
2224   As not a Souldiour of this seasons stampe,
2225   Should go so generall currant through the world.
2226   By heauen I cannot flatter: I defie
2227   The Tongues of Soothers. But a Brauer place
2228   In my hearts loue, hath no man then your Selfe.
2229   Nay, taske me to my word: approue me Lord.
2230   <S {Dow}.> Thou art the King of Honor:
2231   No man so potent breathes vpon the ground,
2232   But I will Beard him.
2233   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2234   <S {Hot}.> Do so, and 'tis well. What letters hast there?
2235   I can but thanke you.
2236   <S {Mess}.> These Letters come from your Father.
2237   <S {Hot}.> Letters from him?
2238   Why comes he not himselfe?
2239   <S {Mes}.> He cannot come, my Lord,
2240   He is greeuous sicke.
2241   <S {Hot}.> How? haz he the leysure to be sicke now,
2242   In such a iustling time? Who leades his power?
2243   Vnder whose Gouernment come they along?
      <P f2v><C H>
2244   <S {Mess}.> His Letters beares his minde, not I his minde.
2245   <S {Wor}.> I prethee tell me, doth he keepe his Bed?
2246   <S {Mess}.> He did, my Lord, foure dayes ere I set forth:
2247   And at the time of my departure thence,
2248   He was much fear'd by his Physician.
2249   <S {Wor}.> I would the state of time had first beene whole,
2250   Ere he by sicknesse had beene visited:
2251   His health was neuer better worth then now.
2252  *<S {Hotsp}.> Sicke now? droope now? this sicknes doth infect
2253   The very Life- blood of our Enterprise,
2254   'Tis catching hither, euen to our Campe.
2255   He writes me here, that inward sicknesse,
2256   And that his friends by deputation
2257  *Could not so soone be drawne: nor did he thinke it meet,
2258   To lay so dangerous and deare a trust
2259   On any Soule remou'd, but on his owne.
2260   Yet doth he giue vs bold aduertisement,
2261   That with our small coniunction we should on,
2262   To see how Fortune is dispos'd to vs:
2263   For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
2264   Because the King is certainely possest
2265   Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2266   <S {Wor}.> Your Fathers sicknesse is a mayme to vs.
2267   <S {Hotsp}.> A perillous Gash, a very Limme lopt off:
2268   And yet, in faith, it is not his present want
2269   Seemes more then we shall finde it.
2270   Were it good, to set the exact wealth of all our states
2271   All at one Cast? To set so rich a mayne
2272   On the nice hazard of one doubtfull houre,
2273   It were not good: for therein should we reade
2274   The very Bottome, and the Soule of Hope,
2275   The very List, the very vtmost Bound
2276   Of all our fortunes.
2277   <S {Dowg}.> Faith, and so wee should,
2278   Where now remaines a sweet reuersion.
2279   We may boldly spend, vpon the hope
2280   Of what is to come in:
2281   A comfort of retyrement liues in this.
2282   <S {Hotsp}.> A Randeuous, a Home to flye vnto,
2283   If that the Deuill and Mischance looke bigge
2284   Vpon the Maydenhead of our Affaires.
2285   <S {Wor}.> But yet I would your Father had beene here:
2286   The qualitie and Heire of our Attempt
2287   Brookes no diuision: It will be thought
2288   By some, that know not why he is away,
2289   That wisedome, loyaltie, and meere dislike
2290   Of our proceedings, kept the Earle from hence.
2291   And thinke, how such an apprehension
2292   May turne the tyde of fearefull Faction,
2293   And breede a kinde of question in our cause:
2294   For well you know, wee of the offring side,
2295   Must keepe aloofe from strict arbitrement,
2296   And stop all sight- holes, euery loope, from whence
2297   The eye of reason may prie in vpon vs:
2298   This absence of your Father drawes a Curtaine,
2299   That shewes the ignorant a kinde of feare,
2300   Before not dreamt of.
2301   <S {Hotsp}.> You strayne too farre.
2302   I rather of his absence make this vse:
2303   It lends a Lustre, and more great Opinion,
2304   A larger Dare to your great Enterprize,
2305   Then if the Earle were here: for men must thinke,
2306   If we without his helpe, can make a Head
2307   To push against the Kingdome; with his helpe,
2308   We shall o're- turne it topsie- turuy downe:
2309   Yet all goes well, yet all our ioynts are whole.
2310   <S {Dowg}.> As heart can thinke:
2311   There is not such a word spoke of in Scotland,
2312   At this Dreame of Feare.
2313   <D {Enter Sir Richard Vernon}.>
2314   <S {Hotsp}.> My Cousin {Vernon}, welcome by my Soule.
2315  *<S {Vern}.> Pray God my newes be worth a welcome, Lord.
2316   The Earle of Westmerland, seuen thousand strong,
2317   Is marching hither- wards, with Prince {Iohn}.
2318   <S {Hotsp}.> No harme: what more?
2319   <S {Vern}.> And further, I haue learn'd,
2320   The King himselfe in person hath set forth,
2321   Or hither- wards intended speedily,
2322   With strong and mightie preparation.
2323   <S {Hotsp}.> He shall be welcome too.
2324   Where is his Sonne,
2325   The nimble- footed Mad- Cap, Prince of Wales,
2326   And his Cumrades, that daft the World aside,
2327   And bid it passe?
2328   <S {Vern}.> All furnisht, all in Armes,
2329   All plum'd like Estridges, that with the Winde
2330   Bayted like Eagles, hauing lately bath'd,
2331   Glittering in Golden Coates, like Images,
2332   As full of spirit as the Moneth of #May,
2333   And gorgeous as the Sunne at Mid- summer,
2334   Wanton as youthfull Goates, wilde as young Bulls.
2335   I saw young {Harry} with his Beuer on,
2336   His Cushes on his thighes, gallantly arm'd,
2337   Rise from the ground like feathered {Mercury},
2338   And vaulted with such ease into his Seat,
2339   As if an Angell dropt downe from the Clouds,
2340   To turne and winde a fierie {Pegasus},
2341   And witch the World with Noble Horsemanship.
2342   <S {Hotsp}.> No more, no more,
2343   Worse then the Sunne in March:
2344   This prayse doth nourish Agues: let them come.
2345   They come like Sacrifices in their trimme,
2346   And to the fire- ey'd Maid of smoakie Warre,
2347   All hot, and bleeding, will wee offer them:
2348   The mayled {Mars} shall on his Altar sit
2349   Vp to the eares in blood. I am on fire,
2350   To heare this rich reprizall is so nigh,
2351   And yet not ours. Come, let me take my Horse,
2352   Who is to beare me like a Thunder- bolt,
2353   Against the bosome of the Prince of Wales.
2354   {Harry} to {Harry}, shall not Horse to Horse
2355   Meete, and ne're part, till one drop downe a Coarse?
2356   Oh, that {Glendower} were come.
2357   <S {Ver}.> There is more newes:
2358   I learned in Worcester, as I rode along,
2359   He cannot draw his Power this fourteene dayes.
2360  *<S {Dowg}.> That's the worst Tidings that I heare of
2361   yet.
2362   <S {Wor}.> #I by my faith, that beares a frosty sound.
2363  *<S {Hotsp}.> What may the Kings whole Battaile reach
2364   vnto?
2365   <S {Ver}.> To thirty thousand.
2366   <S {Hot}.> Forty let it be,
2367   My Father and {Glendower} being both away,
2368   The powres of vs, may serue so great a day.
2369   Come, let vs take a muster speedily:
2370   Doomesday is neere; dye all, dye merrily.
2371   <S {Dow}.> Talke not of dying, I am out of feare
2372   Of death, or deaths hand, for this one halfe yeare.
2373   <D {Exeunt Omnes}.>
      <P f3>
2374   <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
2375   <D {Enter Falstaffe and Bardolph}.>
2376  *<S {Falst}.> {Bardolph}, get thee before to Couentry, fill me a
2377  *Bottle of Sack, our Souldiers shall march through: wee'le
2378   to Sutton- cop- hill to Night.
2379   <S {Bard}.> Will you giue me Money, Captaine?
2380   <S {Falst}.> Lay out, lay out.
2381   <S {Bard}.> This Bottle makes an Angell.
2382  *<S {Falst}.> #And if it doe, take it for thy labour: and if it
2383  *make twentie, take them all, Ile answere the Coynage.
2384   Bid my Lieutenant {Peto} meete me at the Townes end.
2385   <S {Bard}.> I will Captaine: farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
2386  *<S {Falst}.> If I be not asham'd of my Souldiers, I am a
2387  *sowc't- Gurnet: I haue mis- vs'd the Kings Presse dam-nably.
2388  *I haue got, in exchange of a hundred and fiftie
2389  *Souldiers, three hundred and odde Pounds. I presse me
2390  *none but good House- holders, Yeomens Sonnes: enquire
2391  *me out contracted Batchelers, such as had beene ask'd
2392  *twice on the Banes: such a Commoditie of warme slaues,
2393  *as had as lieue heare the Deuill, as a Drumme; such as
2394  *feare the report of a Caliuer, worse then a struck- Foole,
2395  *or a hurt wilde- Ducke. I prest me none but such Tostes
2396  *and Butter, with Hearts in their Bellyes no bigger then
2397  *Pinnes heads, and they haue bought out their seruices:
2398  *And now, my whole Charge consists of Ancients, Cor-porals,
2399  *Lieutenants, Gentlemen of Companies, Slaues as
2400  *ragged a {Lazarus} in the painted Cloth, where the Glut-tons
2401  *Dogges licked his Sores; and such, as indeed were
2402  *neuer Souldiers, but dis- carded vniust Seruingmen, youn-ger
2403  *Sonnes to younger Brothers, reuolted Tapsters and
2404  *Ostlers, Trade- falne, the Cankers of a calme World, and
2405  *long Peace, tenne times more dis- honorable ragged,
2406  *then an old- fac'd Ancient; and such haue I to fill vp the
2407  *roomes of them that haue bought out their seruices: that
2408  *you would thinke, that I had a hundred and fiftie totter'd
2409  *Prodigalls, lately come from Swine- keeping, from eating
2410  *Draffe and Huskes. A mad fellow met me on the way,
2411  *and told me, I had vnloaded all the Gibbets, and prest the
2412  *dead bodyes. No eye hath seene such skar- Crowes: Ile
2413  *not march through Couentry with them, that's flat. Nay,
2414  *and the Villaines march wide betwixt the Legges, as if
2415  *they had Gyues on; for indeede, I had the most of them
2416  *out of Prison. There's not a Shirt and a halfe in all my
2417  *Company: and the halfe Shirt is two Napkins tackt to-gether,
2418  *and throwne ouer the shoulders like a Heralds
2419  *Coat, without sleeues: and the Shirt, to say the truth,
2420  *stolne from my Host of S[aint]. Albones, or the Red- Nose
2421  *Inne- keeper of Dauintry. But that's all one, they'le finde
2422   Linnen enough on euery Hedge.
2423   <D {Enter the Prince, and the Lord of Westmerland}.>
2424   <S {Prince}.> How now blowne {Iack}? how now Quilt?
2425  *<S {Falst}.> What {Hal}? How now mad Wag, what a Deuill
2426  *do'st thou in Warwickshire? My good Lord of West-merland,
2427  *I cry you mercy, I thought your Honour had al-ready
2428   beene at Shrewsbury.
2429  *<S {West}.> 'Faith, Sir {Iohn}, 'tis more then time that I were
2430  *there, and you too: but my Powers are there alreadie.
2431  *The King, I can tell you, lookes for vs all: we must away
2432   all to Night.
2433  *<S {Falst}.> Tut, neuer feare me, I am as vigilant as a Cat, to
2434   steale Creame.
2435  *<S {Prince}.> I thinke to steale Creame indeed, for thy theft
2436  *hath alreadie made thee Butter: but tell me, {Iack}, whose
2437   fellowes are these that come after?
2438   <S {Falst}.> Mine, {Hal}, mine.
2439   <S {Prince}.> I did neuer see such pittifull Rascals.
2440  *<S {Falst}.> Tut, tut, good enough to tosse: foode for Pow-der,
2441  *foode for Powder: they'le fill a Pit, as well as better:
2442   tush man, mortall men, mortall men.
2443  *<S {Westm}.> #I, but Sir {Iohn}, me thinkes they are exceeding
2444   poore and bare, too beggarly.
2445  *<S {Falst}.> Faith, for their pouertie, I know not where they
2446  *had that; and for their barenesse, I am sure they neuer
2447   learn'd that of me.
2448  *<S {Prince}.> No, Ile be sworne, vnlesse you call three fingers
2449  *on the Ribbes bare. But sirra, make haste, {Percy} is already
2450   in the field.
2451   <S {Falst}.> What, is the King encamp'd?
2452  *<S {Westm}.> Hee is, Sir {Iohn}, I feare wee shall stay too
2453   long.
2454  *<S {Falst}.> Well, to the latter end of a Fray, and the begin-ning
2455   of a Feast, fits a dull fighter, and a keene Guest.
2456   <D {Exeunt}.>
2457   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
2458   <D {Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Dowglas, and}
2459   {Vernon}.>
2460   <S {Hotsp}.> Wee'le fight with him to Night.
2461   <S {Worc}.> It may not be.
2462   <S {Dowg}.> You giue him then aduantage.
2463   <S {Vern}.> Not a whit.
2464   <S {Hotsp}.> Why say you so?  lookes he not for supply?
2465   <S {Vern}.> So doe wee.
2466   <S {Hotsp}.> His is certaine, ours is doubtfull.
2467   <S {Worc}.> Good Cousin be aduis'd, stirre not to night.
2468   <S {Vern}.> Doe not, my Lord.
2469   <S {Dowg}.> You doe not counsaile well:
2470   You speake it out of feare, and cold heart.
2471   <S {Vern}.> Doe me no slander, {Dowglas}: by my Life,
2472   And I dare well maintaine it with my Life,
2473   If well- respected Honor bid me on,
2474   I hold as little counsaile with weake feare,
2475   As you, my Lord, or any Scot that this day liues.
2476   Let it be seene to morrow in the Battell,
2477   Which of vs feares.
2478   <S {Dowg}.> Yea, or to night.
2479   <S {Vern}.> Content.
2480   <S {Hotsp}.> To night, say I.
2481   <S {Vern}.> Come, come, it may not be.
2482  *I wonder much, being me[n] of such great leading as you are
2483   That you fore- see not what impediments
2484   Drag backe our expedition: certaine Horse
2485   Of my Cousin {Vernons} are not yet come vp,
2486   Your Vnckle {Worcesters} Horse came but to day,
2487   And now their pride and mettall is asleepe,
2488   Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
2489   That not a Horse is halfe the halfe of himselfe.
2490   <S {Hotsp}.> So are the Horses of the Enemie
2491   In generall iourney bated, and brought low:
2492   The better part of ours are full of rest.
      <P f3v>
2493   <S {Worc}.> The number of the King exceedeth ours:
2494   For Gods sake, Cousin, stay till all come in.
2495   <D {The Trumpet sounds a Parley. Enter Sir}
2496   {Walter Blunt}.>
2497   <S {Blunt}.> I come with gracious offers from the King,
2498   If you vouchsafe me hearing, and respect.
2499   <S {Hotsp}.> Welcome, Sir {Walter Blunt}:
2500   And would to God you were of our determination.
2501   Some of vs loue you well: and euen those some
2502   Enuie your great deseruings, and good name,
2503   Because you are not of our qualitie,
2504   But stand against vs like an Enemie.
2505   <S {Blunt}.> And Heauen defend, but still I should stand so,
2506   So long as out of Limit, and true Rule,
2507   You stand against anoynted Maiestie.
2508   But to my Charge.
2509   The King hath sent to know
2510   The nature of your Griefes, and whereupon
2511   You coniure from the Brest of Ciuill Peace,
2512   Such bold Hostilitie, teaching his dutious Land
2513   Audacious Crueltie. If that the King
2514   Haue any way your good Deserts forgot,
2515   Which he confesseth to be manifold,
2516   He bids you name your Griefes, and with all speed
2517   You shall haue your desires, with interest;
2518   And Pardon absolute for your selfe, and these,
2519   Herein mis- led, by your suggestion.
2520   <S {Hotsp}.> The King is kinde:
2521   And well wee know, the King
2522   Knowes at what time to promise, when to pay.
2523   My Father, my Vnckle, and my selfe,
2524   Did giue him that same Royaltie he weares:
2525   And when he was not sixe and twentie strong,
2526   Sicke in the Worlds regard, wretched, and low,
2527   A poore vnminded Out- law, sneaking home,
2528   My Father gaue him welcome to the shore:
2529   And when he heard him sweare, and vow to God,
2530   He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
2531   To sue his Liuerie, and begge his Peace,
2532   With teares of Innocencie, and tearmes of Zeale;
2533   My Father, in kinde heart and pitty mou'd,
2534   Swore him assistance, and perform'd it too.
2535   Now, when the Lords and Barons of the Realme
2536   Perceiu'd {Northumberland} did leane to him,
2537   The more and lesse came in with Cap and Knee,
2538   Met him in Boroughs, Cities, Villages,
2539   Attended him on Bridges, stood in Lanes,
2540   Layd Gifts before him, proffer'd him their Oathes,
2541   Gaue him their Heires, as Pages followed him,
2542   Euen at the heeles, in golden multitudes.
2543   He presently, as Greatnesse knowes it selfe,
2544   Step me a little higher then his Vow
2545   Made to my Father, while his blood was poore,
2546   Vpon the naked shore at Rauenspurgh:
2547   And now (forsooth) takes on him to reforme
2548   Some certaine Edicts, and some strait Decrees,
2549   That lay too heauie on the Common- wealth;
2550   Cryes out vpon abuses, seemes to weepe
2551   Ouer his Countries Wrongs: and by this Face,
2552   This seeming Brow of Iustice, did he winne
2553   The hearts of all that hee did angle for.
2554   Proceeded further, cut me off the Heads
2555   Of all the Fauorites, that the absent King
2556   In deputation left behinde him heere,
2557   When hee was personall in the Irish Warre.
2558   <S {Blunt}.> Tut, I came not to hear this.
2559   <S {Hotsp}.> Then to the point.
2560   In short time after, hee depos'd the King.
2561   Soone after that, depriu'd him of his Life:
2562   And in the neck of that, task't the whole State.
2563   To make that worse, suffer'd  his Kinsman {March},
2564   Who is, if euery Owner were plac'd,
2565   Indeede his King, to be engag'd in Wales,
2566   There, without Ransome, to lye forfeited:
2567   Disgrac'd me in my happie Victories,
2568   Sought to intrap me by intelligence,
2569   Rated my Vnckle from the Councell- Boord,
2570   In rage dismiss'd my Father from the Court,
2571   Broke Oath on Oath, committed Wrong on Wrong,
2572   And in conclusion, droue vs to seeke out
2573   This Head of safetie; and withall, to prie
2574   Into his Title: the which wee finde
2575   Too indirect, for long continuance.
2576   <S {Blunt}.> Shall I returne this answer to the King?
2577   <S {Hotsp}.> Not so, Sir {Walter}.
2578   Wee'le with- draw #a while:
2579   Goe to the King, and let there be impawn'd
2580   Some suretie for a safe returne againe,
2581   And in the Morning early shall my Vnckle
2582   Bring him our purpose: and so farewell.
2583  *<S {Blunt}.> I would you would accept of Grace and Loue.
2584   <S {Hotsp}.> And't may be, so wee shall.
2585   <S {Blunt}.> Pray Heauen you doe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2586   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2587   <D {Enter the Arch- Bishop of Yorke, and Sir Michell}.>
2588   <S {Arch}.> Hie, good Sir {Michell}, beare this sealed Briefe
2589   With winged haste to the Lord Marshall,
2590   This to my Cousin {Scroope}, and all the rest
2591   To whom they are directed.
2592   If you knew how much they doe import,
2593   You would make haste.
2594   <S {Sir} {Mich}.> My good Lord, I guesse their tenor.
2595   <S {Arch}.> Like enough you doe.
2596   To morrow, good Sir {Michell}, is a day,
2597   Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
2598   Must bide the touch. For Sir, at Shrewsbury,
2599   As I am truly giuen to vnderstand,
2600   The King, with mightie and quick- raysed Power,
2601   Meetes with Lord {Harry}: and I feare, Sir {Michell},
2602   What with the sicknesse of {Northumberland},
2603   Whose Power was in the first proportion;
2604   And what with {Owen Glendowers} absence thence,
2605   Who with them was rated firmely too,
2606   And comes not in, ouer- rul'd by Prophecies,
2607   I feare the Power of {Percy} is too weake,
2608   To wage an instant tryall  with the King.
2609   <S {Sir} {Mich}.> Why, my good Lord, you need not feare,
2610   There is {Dowglas}, and Lord {Mortimer}.
2611   <S {Arch}.> No, {Mortimer} is not there.
2612  *<S {Sir} {Mic}.> But there is {Mordake}, {Vernon}, Lord {Harry Percy},
2613   And there is my Lord of Worcester,
2614   And a Head of gallant Warriors,
2615   Noble Gentlemen.
      <P f4><C B>
2616   <S {Arch}.> And so there is, but yet the King hath Drawne
2617   The speciall head of all the Land together:
2618   The Prince of Wales, Lord {Iohn} of Lancaster,
2619   The Noble Westmerland, and warlike {Blunt};
2620   And many moe Corriuals, and deare men
2621   Of estimation, and command in Armes.
2622  *<S {Sir} {M}.> Doubt not my Lord, he shall be well oppos'd
2623   <S {Arch}.> I hope no lesse? Yet needfull 'tis to feare,
2624   And to preuent the worst, Sir {Michell} speed;
2625   For if Lord {Percy} thriue not, ere the King
2626   Dismisse his power, he meanes to visit vs:
2627   For he hath heard of our Confederacie,
2628   And, 'tis but Wisedome to make strong against  him:
2629   Therefore make #hast, I must go write againe
2630   To other Friends: and so farewell, Sir {Michell}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2631   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2632   <D {Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord Iohn of Lancaster},
2633   {Earle of Westmerland, Sir Walter Blunt},
2634   {and Falstaffe}.>
2635   <S {King}.> How bloodily the Sunne begins  to peere
2636   Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
2637   At his distemperature
2638   <S {Prin}.> The Southerne winde
2639   Doth play the Trumpet to his purposes,
2640   And by his hollow whistling in the Leaues,
2641   Fortels a Tempest, and a blust'ring day.
2642   <S {King}.> Then with the losers let it sympathize,
2643   For nothing can seeme foule to those that win.
2644   <D {The Trumpet sounds}.>
2645   <D {Enter Worcester}.>
2646   <S {King}.> How now my Lord of Worster? 'Tis not well
2647   That you and I should meet vpon such tearmes,
2648   As now we meet. You haue deceiu'd our trust,
2649   And made vs doffe our easie Robes of Peace,
2650   To crush our old limbes in vngentle Steele:
2651   This is not well, my Lord, this is not well.
2652   What say you to it? Will you againe vnknit
2653   This churlish knot of all- abhorred Warre?
2654   And moue in the obedient Orbe againe,
2655   Where you did giue a faire and naturall light,
2656   And be no more an exhall'd Meteor,
2657   A prodigie of Feare, and a Portent
2658   Of broached Mischeefe, to the vnborne Times?
2659   <S {Wor}.> Heare me, my Liege:
2660   For mine owne part, I could be well content
2661   To entertaine the Lagge- end of my life
2662   With quiet houres: For I do protest,
2663   I haue not sought the day of this dislike.
2664   <S {King}.> You haue not sought it: how comes it then?
2665   <S {Fal}.> Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
2666   <S {Prin}.> Peace, Chewet, peace.
2667   <S {Wor}.> It pleas'd your Maiesty, to turne your lookes
2668   Of Fauour, from my Selfe, and all our House;
2669   And yet I must remember you my Lord,
2670   We were the first, and dearest of your Friends:
2671   For you, my staffe of Office did I breake
2672   In {Richards} time, and poasted day and night
2673   To meete you on the way, and kisse your hand,
2674   When yet you were in place, and in account
2675   Nothing so strong and fortunate, as I;
2676   It was my Selfe, my Brother, and his Sonne,
2677   That brought you home, and boldly did out- dare
2678   The danger of the time. You swore to vs,
2679   And you did sweare that Oath at Doncaster,
2680   That you did nothing of purpose 'gainst the State,
2681   Nor claime no further, then your new- falne right,
2682   The seate of {Gaunt}, Dukedome of Lancaster,
2683   To this, we sware our aide: But in short space,
2684   It rain'd downe Fortune showring on your head,
2685   And such a floud of Greatnesse fell on you,
2686   What with our helpe, what with the absent King.
2687   What with the iniuries of wanton time,
2688   The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
2689   And the contrarious Windes that held the King
2690   So long in the vnlucky Irish Warres,
2691   That all in England did repute him dead:
2692   And from this swarme of faire aduantages,
2693   You tooke occasion to be quickly woo'd,
2694   To gripe the generall sway into your hand,
2695   Forgot your Oath to vs at Doncaster,
2696   And being fed by vs, you vs'd vs so,
2697   As that vngentle gull the Cuckowes Bird,
2698   Vseth the Sparrow, did oppresse our Nest
2699   Grew by our Feeding, to so great a builke,
2700   That euen our Loue durst not come neere your sight
2701   For feare of swallowing: But with nimble wing
2702   We were infor'd for safety sake, to flye
2703   Out of your sight, and raise this present Head,
2704   Whereby we stand opposed by such meanes
2705   As you your selfe, haue forg'd against your selfe,
2706   By vnkinde vsage, dangerous countenance,
2707   And violation of all faith and troth
2708   Sworne to vs in yonger enterprize.
2709   <S {Kin}.> These things indeed you haue articulated,
2710   Proclaim'd at Market Crosses, read in Churches,
2711   To face the Garment of Rebellion
2712   With some fine colour, that may please the eye
2713   Of fickle Changelings, and poore Discontents,
2714   Which gape, and rub the Elbow at the newes
2715   Of hurly burly Innouation:
2716   And neuer yet did Insurrection want
2717   Such water- colours, to impaint his cause:
2718   Nor moody Beggars, staruing for a time
2719   Of pell- mell hauocke, and confusion.
2720   <S {Prin}.> In both our Armies, there is many a soule
2721   Shall pay full dearely for this encounter,
2722   If once they ioyne in triall. Tell your Nephew,
2723   The Prince of Wales doth ioyne with all the world
2724   In praise of {Henry Percie}: By my Hopes,
2725   This present enterprize set off his head,
2726   I do not thinke a brauer Gentleman,
2727   More actiue, valiant, or more valiant yong,
2728   More daring, or more bold, is now aliue,
2729   To grace this latter Age with Noble deeds.
2730   For my part, I may speake it to my shame,
2731   I haue a Truant beene to Chiualry,
2732   And so I heare, he doth account me too:
2733   Yet this before my Fathers Maiesty,
2734   I am content that he shall take the oddes
2735   Of his great name and estimation,
2736   And will, to saue the blood on either side,
2737   Try fortune with him, in a Single Fight.
2738   <S {King}.> And Prince of Wales, so dare we venter thee,
2739   Albeit, considerations infinite
      <P f4v>
2740   Do make against it: No good Worster, no,
2741   We loue our people well; euen those we loue
2742   That are misled vpon your Cousins part:
2743   And will they take the offer of our Grace:
2744   Both he, and they, and you; yea euery man
2745   Shall be my Friend againe, and Ile be his.
2746   So tell your Cousin, and bring me word,
2747   What he will do. But if he will not yeeld,
2748   Rebuke and dread correction waite on vs,
2749   And they shall do their Office. So bee gone,
2750   We will not now be troubled with reply,
2751   We offer faire, take it aduisedly.
2752   <D {Exit Worcester}.>
2753   <S {Prin}.> It will not be accepted, on my life,
2754   The {Dowglas} and the {Hotspurre} both together,
2755   Are confident against the world in Armes.
2756   <S {King}.> Hence therefore, euery Leader to his charge,
2757   For on their answer will we set on them;
2758   And God befriend vs, as our cause is iust.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2759   <D {Manet Prince and Falstaffe}.>
2760   <S {Fal}.> {Hal}, if thou see me downe in the battell,
2761   And bestride me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
2762  *<S {Prin}.> Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that frendship
2763   Say thy prayers, and farewell.
2764   <S {Fal}.> I would it were bed time {Hal}, and all well.
2765   <S {Prin}.> Why, thou ow'st heauen a death.
2766  *<S {Falst}.> 'Tis not due yet: I would bee loath to pay him
2767  *before his day. What neede I bee so forward with him,
2768  *that call's not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, Honor prickes
2769  *me on. But how if Honour pricke me off when I come
2770  *on? How then? Can Honour set too a legge? No: or an
2771  *arme? No: Or take away the greefe of a wound? No.
2772  *Honour hath no skill in Surgerie, then? No. What is Ho-nour
2773  *A word. What is that word Honour? Ayre: A
2774  *trim reckoning. Who hath it? He that dy'de #a Wednes-day.
2775  *Doth he feele it? No. Doth hee heare it? No. Is it
2776  *insensible then? yea, to the dead. But wil it not liue with
2777  *the liuing? No. Why? Detraction wil not suffer it, ther-fore
2778  *Ile none of it. Honour is a meere Scutcheon, and so
2779   ends my Catechisme.  <D {Exit}.>
2780   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2781   <D {Enter Worcester, and Sir Richard Vernon}.>
2782   <S {Wor}.> O no, my Nephew must not know, Sir {Richard},
2783   The liberall kinde offer of the King.
2784   <S {Ver}.> 'Twere best he did.
2785   <S {Wor}.> Then we are all vndone.
2786   It is not possible, it cannot be,
2787   The King would keepe his word in louing vs,
2788   He will suspect vs still, and finde a time
2789   To punish this offence in others faults:
2790   Supposition, all our liues, shall be stucke full of eyes;
2791   For Treason is but trusted like the Foxe,
2792   Who ne're so tame, so cherisht, and lock'd vp,
2793   Will haue a wilde tricke of his Ancestors:
2794   Looke how he can, or sad or merrily,
2795   Interpretation will misquote our lookes,
2796   And we shall feede like Oxen at a stall,
2797   The better cherisht, still the nearer death.
2798   My Nephewes Trespasse may be well forgot,
2799   It hath the excuse of youth, and heate of blood,
2800   And an adopted name of Priuiledge,
2801   A haire- brain'd {Hotspurre}, gouern'd by a Spleene:
2802   All his offences liue vpon my head,
2803   And on his Fathers. We did traine him on,
2804   And his corruption being tane from vs,
2805   We as the Spring of all, shall pay for all:
2806   Therefore good Cousin, let not {Harry} know
2807   In any case, the offer of the King.
2808   <S {Ver}.> Deliuer what you will, Ile say 'tis so.
2809   Heere comes your Cosin.
2810   <D {Enter Hotspurre}.>
2811   <S {Hot}.> My Vnkle is return'd,
2812   Deliuer vp my Lord of Westmerland.
2813   Vnkle, what newes?
2814   <S {Wor}.> The King will bid you battell presently.
2815   <S {Dow}.> Defie him by the Lord of Westmerland
2816   <S {Hot}.> Lord {Dowglas}: Go  you and tell him so.
2817   <S {Dow}.> Marry and shall, and verie willingly.
2818   <D {Exit Dowglas}.>
2819   <S {Wor}.> There is no seeming mercy in the King.
2820   <S {Hot}.> Did you begge any? God forbid.
2821   <S {Wor}.> I told him gently of our greeuances,
2822   Of his Oath- breaking: which he mended thus,
2823   By now forswearing that he is forsworne,
2824   He cals vs Rebels, Traitors, and will scourge
2825   With haughty armes, this hatefull name in vs.
2826   <D {Enter Dowglas}.>
2827  *<S {Dow}.> Arme Gentlemen, to Armes, for I haue thrown
2828   A braue defiance in King {Henries} teeth:
2829   And Westmerland that was ingag'd did beare it,
2830   Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
2831  *<S {Wor}.> The Prince of Wales stept forth before the king,
2832   And Nephew, challeng'd you to single fight.
2833   <S {Hot}.> O, would the quarrell lay vpon our heads,
2834   And that no man might draw short breath to day,
2835   But I and {Harry Monmouth}. Tell me, tell mee,
2836   How shew'd his Talking? Seem'd it in contempt?
2837   <S {Ver}.> No, by my Soule: I neuer in my life
2838   Did heare a Challenge vrg'd more modestly,
2839   Vnlesse a Brother should a Brother dare
2840   To gentle exercise, and proofe of Armes.
2841   He gaue you all the Duties of a Man,
2842   Trimm'd vp your praises with a Princely tongue,
2843   Spoke your deseruings like a Chronicle,
2844   Making  you euer better then his praise,
2845   By still dispraising praise, valew'd with you:
2846   And which became him like a Prince indeed,
2847   He made a blushing citall of himselfe,
2848   And chid his Trewant youth with such a Grace,
2849   As if he mastred there a double spirit
2850   Of teaching, and of learning instantly:
2851   There did he pause. But let me tell the World,
2852   If he out- liue the enuie of this day,
2853   England did neuer owe so sweet a hope,
2854   So much misconstrued in his Wantonnesse,
2855   <S {Hot}.> Cousin, I thinke thou art enamored
2856   On his Follies: neuer did I heare
2857   Of any Prince so wilde at Liberty.
2858   But be he as he will, yet once ere night,
2859   I will imbrace him with a Souldiers arme,
2860   That he shall shrinke vnder my curtesie.
2861   Arme, arme with speed. And Fellow's, Soldiers, Friends,
2862   Better consider what you haue to do,
2863   That I that haue not well the gift of Tongue,
      <P f5>
2864   Can lift your blood vp with perswasion.
2865   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2866   <S {Mes}.> My Lord, heere are Letters for you.
2867   <S {Hot}.> I cannot reade them now.
2868   O Gentlemen, the time of life is short;
2869   To spend that shortnesse basely, were too long.
2870   If life did ride vpon a Dials point,
2871   Still ending at the arriuall of an houre,
2872   #And if we liue, we liue to treade on Kings:
2873   If dye; braue death, when Princes dye with vs.
2874   Now for our Consciences, the Armes is faire,
2875   When the intent for bearing them is iust.
2876   <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
2877   <S {Mes}.> My Lord prepare, the King comes on apace.
2878   <S {Hot}.> I thanke him, that he cuts me from my tale:
2879   For I professe not talking: Onely this,
2880   Let each man do his best. And heere I draw a Sword,
2881   Whose worthy temper I intend to staine
2882   With the best blood that I can meete withall,
2883   In the aduenture of this perillous day.
2884   Now Esperance {Percy}, and set on:
2885   Sound all the lofty Instruments of Warre,
2886   And by that Musicke, let vs all imbrace:
2887   For heauen to earth, some of vs neuer shall,
2888   A second time do such a curtesie.
2889   <D {They embrace, the trumpets sound, the King entereth}
2890   {with his power, alarum vnto the battell. Then enter}
2891   {Dowglas, and Sir Walter Blunt}.>
2892  *<S {Blu}.> What is thy name, that in battel thus y crossest me?
2893   What honor dost thou seeke vpon my head?
2894   <S {Dow}.> Know then my name is {Dowglas},
2895   And I do haunt thee in the Battell thus,
2896   Because some tell me, that thou art a King.
2897   <S {Blunt}.> They tell thee true.
2898  *<S {Dow}.> The Lord of Stafford deere to day hath bought
2899   Thy likenesse: for insted of thee King {Harry},
2900   This Sword hath ended him, so shall it thee,
2901   Vnlesse thou yeeld thee as a Prisoner.
2902   <S {Blu}.> I was not borne to yeeld, thou haughty Scot,
2903   And thou shalt finde a King that will reuenge
2904   Lords Staffords death.
2905   <D {Fight, Blunt is slaine, then enters Hotspur}.>
2906  *<S {Hot}.> O {Dowglas}, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus
2907   I neuer had triumphed o're a Scot.
2908  *<S {Dow}.> All's done, all's won, here breathles lies the king
2909   <S {Hot}.> Where?
2910   <S {Dow}.> Heere.
2911   <S {Hot}.> This {Dowglas}? No, I know this face full well:
2912   A gallant Knight he was, his name was {Blunt},
2913   Semblably furnish'd like the King himselfe.
2914   <S {Dow}.> Ah foole:  go with thy soule whether it goes,
2915   A borrowed Title hast thou bought too deere.
2916   Why didst thou tell me, that thou wer't a King?
2917   <S {Hot}.> The King hath many marching in his Coats.
2918   <S {Dow}.> Now by my Sword, I will kill all his Coates,
2919   Ile murder all his Wardrobe peece by peece,
2920   Vntill I meet the King.
2921   <S {Hot}.> Vp, and away,
2922   Our Souldiers stand full fairely for the day.  <D {Exeunt}>
2923   <D {Alarum, and enter Falstaffe solus}.>
2924  *<S {Fal}.> Though I could scape shot- free at London, I fear
2925  *the shot heere:  here's no scoring, but vpon the pate. Soft
2926  *who are you? Sir {Walter Blunt}, there's Honour for you:
2927  *here's no vanity, I am as hot as molten Lead, and as hea-uy
2928  *too; heauen keepe Lead out of mee, I neede no more
2929  *weight then mine owne Bowelles. I haue led my rag of
2930  *Muffins where they are pepper'd:  there's not three of my
2931  *150. left aliue, and they for the Townes end, to beg du-ring
2932   life. But who comes heere?
2933   <D {Enter the Prince}.>
2934  *<S {Pri}.> What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword,
2935   Many a Nobleman lies starke and stiffe
2936   Vnder the hooues of vaunting enemies,
2937  *Whose deaths are vnreueng'd. Prethy lend me thy sword
2938  *<S {Fal}.> O {Hal}, I prethee giue me leaue to breath awhile:
2939  *Turke {Gregory} neuer did such deeds in Armes, as I haue
2940   done this day. I haue paid {Percy}, I haue made him sure.
2941   <S {Prin}.> He is indeed, and liuing to kill thee:
2942   I prethee lend me thy sword.
2943   <S {Falst}.> Nay {Hal}, is {Percy} bee aliue,  thou getst not my
2944   Sword; but take my Pistoll if thou wilt.
2945   <S {Prin}.> Giue it me: What, is it in the case?
2946   <S {Fal}.> #I {Hal}, 'tis hot:  There's that will Sacke a City.
2947   <D {The Prince drawes out a Bottle of Sacke}.>
2948   <S {Prin}.> What, is it a time to iest and dally now.  <D {Exit}.>
2949   <D {Throwes it at him}.>
2950  *<S {Fal}.> If {Percy} be aliue, Ile pierce him: if he do come in
2951  *my way, so:  if he do not, if I come in his (willingly) let
2952  *him make a Carbonado of me. I like not such grinning
2953  *honour as Sir {Walter} hath: Giue mee life, which if I can
2954  *saue, so:  if not, honour comes vnlook'd for, and ther's an
2955   end.  <D {Exit}>
2956   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2957   <D {Alarum, excursions, enter the King, the Prince},
2958   {Lord Iohn of Lancaster, and Earle}
2959   {of Westmerland}.>
2960  *<S {King}.> I prethee {Harry} withdraw thy selfe, thou blee-dest
2961   too much: Lord {Iohn of Lancaster}, go you with him.
2962   <S {P.Ioh}.> Not I, My Lord, vnlesse I did bleed too.
2963   <S {Prin}.> I beseech your Maiesty make vp,
2964   Least your retirement do amaze your friends.
2965   <S {King}.> I will do so:
2966   My Lord of Westmerland leade him to his Tent.
2967   <S {West}.> Come my Lord, Ile leade you to your Tent.
2968   <S {Prin}.> Lead me my Lord? I do not need your helpe;
2969   And heauen forbid a shallow scratch should driue
2970   The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
2971   Where stain'd Nobility lyes troden on,
2972   And Rebels Armes triumph in massacres.
2973  *<S {Ioh}.> We breath too long: Come cosin Westmerland,
2974   Our duty this way lies, for heauens sake come.
2975   <S {Prin}.> By heauen thou hast deceiu'd me Lancaster,
2976   I did not thinke thee Lord of such a spirit:
2977   Before, I lou'd thee as a Brother, {Iohn};
2978   But now, I do respect thee as my Soule.
2979   <S {King}.> I saw him hold Lord {Percy} at the point,
2980   With lustier maintenance then I did looke for
2981   Of such an vngrowne Warriour.
2982   <S {Prin}.> O this Boy, lends mettall to vs all.  <D {Exit}.>
2983   <D {Enter Dowglas}.>
2984   <S {Dow}.> Another King? They grow like Hydra's heads:
2985   I am the {Dowglas}, fatall to all those
2986   That weare those colours on them. What art thou
2987   That counterfeit'st the person of a King?
2988  *<S {King}.> The King himselfe: who {Dowglas} grieues at hart
      <P f5v>
2989   So many of his shadowes thou hast met,
2990   And not the very King. I haue two Boyes
2991   Seeke {Percy} and thy selfe about the Field:
2992   But seeing thou fall'st  on me so luckily,
2993   I will assay thee:  so defend thy selfe.
2994   <S {Dow}.> I feare thou art another counterfeit:
2995   And yet infaith thou bear'st thee like a King:
2996   But mine I am sure thou art, whoere thou be,
2997   And thus I win thee.  <D {They fight, the K[ing]. being in danger},
2998   {Enter Prince}.>
2999   <S {Prin}.> Hold vp thy head vile Scot, or thou art like
3000   Neuer to hold it vp againe:  the Spirits
3001   Of valiant {Sherly, Stafford, Blunt}, are in my Armes;
3002   it is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,
3003   Who neuer promiseth, but he meanes to pay.
3004   <D {They Fight, Dowglas flyeth}.>
3005   Cheerely My Lord: how fare's your Grace?
3006   Sir {Nicolas Gawsey} hath for succour sent,
3007   And so hath {Clifton}:  Ile to {Clifton} straight.
3008   <S {King}.> Stay, and breath awhile.
3009   Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
3010   And shew'd thou mak'st some tender of my life
3011   In this faire rescue thou hast brought to mee.
3012   <S {Prin}.> O heauen, they did me too much iniury,
3013   That euer said I hearkned to your death.
3014   If it were so, I might haue let alone
3015   The insulting hand of {Dowglas} ouer you,
3016   Which would haue bene as speedy in your end,
3017   As all the poysonous Potions in the world,
3018   And sau'd the Treacherous labour of your Sonne.
3019  *<S {K}.> Make vp to {Clifton}, Ile to Sir {Nicholas Gausey}.  <D {Exit}>
3020   <D {Enter Hotspur}.>
3021   <S {Hot}.> If I mistake not, thou art {Harry Monmouth}.
3022   <S {Prin}.> Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
3023   <S {Hot}.> My name is {Harrie Percie}.
3024  *<S {Prin}.> Why then I see a very valiant rebel of that name.
3025   I am the Prince of Wales, and thinke not {Percy},
3026   To share with me in glory any more:
3027   Two Starres keepe not their motion in one Sphere,
3028   Nor can one England brooke a double reigne,
3029   Of {Harry Percy}, and the Prince of Wales.
3030   <S {Hot}.> Nor shall it {Harry}, for the houre is come
3031   To end the one of vs; and would to heauen,
3032   Thy name in Armes, were now as great as mine.
3033   <S {Prin}.> Ile make it greater, ere I part from thee,
3034   And all the budding Honors on thy Crest,
3035   Ile crop, to make a Garland for my head.
3036   <S {Hot}.> I can no longer brooke thy Vanities.  <D {Fight}.>
3037   <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
3038  *<S {Fal}.> Well said {Hal}, to it {Hal}. Nay you shall finde no
3039   Boyes play heere, I can tell you.
3040   <D {Enter Dowglas, he fights with Falstaffe, who fals down}
3041   {as if he were dead. The Prince killeth Percie}.>
3042   <S {Hot}.> Oh {Harry}, thou hast rob'd me of my youth:
3043   I better brooke the losse of brittle life,
3044   Then those proud Titles thou hast wonne of me,
3045  *They wound my thoghts worse, then the sword my flesh:
3046   But thought's the slaue of Life, and Life, Times foole;
3047   And Time, that takes suruey of all the world,
3048   Must haue a stop. O, I could Prophesie,
3049   But that the Earth, and the cold hand of death,
3050   Lyes on my Tongue: No {Percy}, thou art dust
3051   And food for===
3052  *<S {Prin}.> For Wormes, braue {Percy}. Farewell great heart:
3053   Ill- weau'd Ambition, how much art thou shrunke?
3054   When that this bodie did containe a spirit,
3055   A Kingdome for it was too small a bound:
3056   But now two paces of the vilest Earth
3057   Is roome enough. This Earth that beares #the dead,
3058   Beares not aliue so stout a Gentleman.
3059   If thou wer't sensible of curtesie,
3060   I should not make so great a shew of Zeale.
3061   But let my fauours hide thy mangled face,
3062   And euen in thy behalfe, Ile thanke my selfe
3063   For doing these fayre Rites of Tendernesse.
3064   Adieu,  and take thy praise with thee to heauen,
3065   Thy ignomy sleepe with thee in the graue,
3066   But not remembred in thy Epitaph.
3067   What? Old Acquaintance? Could not all this flesh
3068   Keepe in a little life? Poore Iacke, farewell:
3069   I could haue better spar'd a better man.
3070   O, I should haue a heauy misse of thee,
3071   If I were much in loue with Vanity.
3072   Death hath not strucke so fat a Deere to day,
3073   Though many dearer in this bloody Fray:
3074   Imbowell'd will I see thee #by and by,
3075   Till then, in blood, by Noble {Percie} lye.  <D {Exit}.>
3076   <D {Falstaffe riseth vp}.>
3077  *<S {Falst}.> Imbowell'd? If thou imbowell mee to day, Ile
3078  *giue you leaue to powder me, and eat me too to  morow.
3079  *'Twas time to counterfet, or that hotte Termagant Scot,
3080  *had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I am no coun-terfeit;
3081  *to  dye, is to be a counterfeit, for hee is but the
3082  *counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man: But
3083  *to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liueth, is to be
3084  *no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life in-deede.
3085  *The better part of Valour, is Discretion; in the
3086  *which better part, I haue saued my life. I am affraide of
3087  *this Gun- powder {Percy} though he be dead. How if hee
3088  *should counterfeit too, and rise? I am afraid hee would
3089  *proue the better counterfeit: therefore Ile make him sure:
3090  *yea, and Ile sweare I kill'd him. Why may not hee rise as
3091  *well as I:  Nothing confutes me but eyes, and no- bodie
3092  *sees me. Therefore sirra, with a new wound in your thigh
3093   come you along me.  <D {Takes Hotspurre on his backe}.>
3094   <D {Enter Prince and Iohn of Lancaster}.>
3095  *<S {Prin}.> Come Brother {Iohn}, full brauely hast thou flesht
3096   thy Maiden sword.
3097   <S {Iohn}.> But soft, who haue we heere?
3098   Did you not tell me this Fat man was dead?
3099   <S {Prin}.> I did, I saw him dead,
3100  *Breathlesse, and bleeding on the ground: Art thou aliue?
3101   Or is it fantasie that playes vpon our eye- sight?
3102   I prethee speake, we will not trust our eyes
3103   Without our eares. Thou art not what thou seem'st.
3104  *<S {Fal}.> No, that's certaine:  I am not a double man:  but
3105  *if I be not {Iacke Falstaffe}, then am I a Iacke: There is {Per-cy},
3106  *if your Father will do me any Honor, so: if not, let him
3107  *kill the next {Percie} himselfe. I looke to be either  Earle or
3108   Duke, I can assure you.
3109  *<S {Prin}.> Why, {Percy} I kill'd my selfe, and saw thee dead.
3110  *<S {Fal}.> Did'st thou? Lord, Lord, how the world is giuen
3111  *to Lying? I graunt you I was downe, and out of breath,
3112  *and so was he, but we rose both at an instant, and fought
3113  *a long houre by Shrewsburie clocke. If I may bee belee-ued,
3114  *so: if not, let them that should reward Valour, beare
3115  *the sinne vpon their owne heads. Ile take't on my death
3116  *I gaue him this wound in the Thigh:  if the man were a-liue,
3117  *and would deny it, I would make him eate a peece
3118   of my sword.
3119   <S {Iohn}.> This is the strangest Tale that e're I heard.
3120   <S {Prin}.> This is the strangest Fellow, Brother  {Iohn}.
      <P f6>
3121   Come bring your luggage Nobly on your backe:
3122   For my part, if a lye may do thee grace,
3123   Ile gil'd it with the happiest tearmes I haue.
3124   <D {A Retreat is sounded}.>
3125   The Trumpets sound Retreat, the day is ours:
3126   Come Brother, let's to the highest of the field,
3127   To see what Friends are liuing, who are dead. <D {Exeunt}>
3128   <S {Fal}.> Ile follow as they say, for Reward. Hee that re-wards
3129  *me, heauen reward him. If I do grow great again,
3130  *Ile grow lesse? For Ile purge, and leaue Sacke, and liue
3131   cleanly, as a Nobleman should do. <D {Exit}>
3132   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>

3134   <D {Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord Iohn of Lancaster},
3135   {Earle of Westmerland, with Worcester &}
3136   {Vernon Prisoners}.>
3137   <S {King}.> Thus euer did Rebellion finde Rebuke.
3138   Ill- spirited Worcester, did we not send Grace,
3139   Pardon, and tearmes of Loue to all of you?
3140   And would'st thou turne our offers contrary?
3141   Misuse the tenor of thy Kinsmans trust?
3142   Three Knights vpon our party slaine to day,
3143   A Noble Earle, and many a creature else,
3144   Had beene aliue this houre,
3145   If like a Christian thou had'st truly borne
3146   Betwixt our Armies, true Intelligence.
3147   <S {Wor}.> What I haue done, my safety vrg'd me to,
3148   And I embrace this fortune patiently,
3149   Since not to be auoyded, it fals on mee.
3150   <S {King}.> Beare Worcester to death, and {Vernon} too:
3151   Other offenders we will pause vpon.
3152   <D {Exit Worcester and Vernon}.>
3153   How goes the Field?
3154   <S {Prin}.> The Noble Scot Lord {Dowglas}, when hee saw
3155   The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
3156   The Noble {Percy} slaine, and all his men,
3157   Vpon the foot of feare, fled with the rest;
3158   And falling from a hill, he was so bruiz'd
3159   That the pursuers tooke him. At my Tent
3160   The {Dowglas} is, and I beseech your Grace,
3161   I may dispose of him.
3162   <S {King}.> With all my heart.
3163   <S {Prin}.> Then Brother {Iohn} of Lancaster,
3164   To you this honourable bounty shall belong:
3165   Go to the {Dowglas}, and deliuer him
3166   Vp to his pleasure, ransomlesse and free:
3167   His Valour shewne vpon our Crests to day,
3168   Hath taught vs how to cherish such high deeds,
3169   Euen in the bosome of our Aduersaries.
3170  *<S {King}.> Then this remaines: that we diuide our Power.
3171   You Sonne {Iohn}, and my Cousin Westmerland
3172   Towards Yorke shall bend you, with your deerest speed
3173   To meet Northumberland, and the Prelate {Scroope},
3174   Who (as we heare) are busily in Armes.
3175   My Selfe, and you Sonne {Harry} will towards Wales,
3176   To fight with {Glendower}, and the Earle of March.
3177   Rebellion in this Land shall lose his way,
3178   Meeting the Checke of such another day:
3179   And since this Businesse so faire is done,
3180   Let vs not leaue till all our owne be wonne. <D {Exeunt}.>
