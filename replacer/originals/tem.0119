10     <D {Enter Mariners}.>

17    *<S {Alon}.> Good Boteswaine haue care: where's the Ma-ster?
18     Play the men.
19     <S {Botes}.> I pray now keepe below.
20     <S {Anth}.> Where is the Master, Boson?
21    *<S {Botes}.> Do you not heare him? you marre our labour,
22     Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.
23     <S {Gonz}.> Nay, good be patient.
24    *<S {Botes}.> When the Sea is: hence, what cares these roa-rers
25    *for the name of King? to Cabine; silence: trouble
26     vs not.
27    *<S {Gon}.> Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboord.
28    *<S {Botes}.> None that I more loue then my selfe. You are
29    *a Counsellor, if you can command these Elements to si-lence,
30    *and worke the peace of the present, wee will not
31    *hand a rope more, vse your authoritie: If you cannot,

35     way I say.  <D {Exit}.>
36    *<S {Gon}.> I haue great comfort from this fellow: methinks
37    *he hath no drowning marke vpon him, his complexion
38    *is perfect Gallowes: stand fast good Fate to his han-ging,
39    *make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our

46    *vpon this howling: they are lowder then the weather,

50     incharitable Dog.

53    *we are lesse afraid to be drownde, then thou art.
54    *<S {Gonz}.> I'le warrant him for drowning, though the
55    *Ship were no stronger then a Nutt- shell, and as leaky as
56     an vnstanched wench.
57    *<S {Botes}.> Lay her #a hold, #a hold, set her two courses off
58     to Sea againe, lay her off.
59     <D {Enter Mariners wet}.>
60     <S {Mari}.> All lost, to prayers, to prayers, all lost.

62    *<S {Gonz}.> The King, and Prince, at prayers, let's assist them,

71     Mercy on vs.
72     We split, we split, Farewell my wife, and children,

75     <S {Seb}.> Let's take leaue of him.  <D {Exit}.>
76    *<S {Gonz}.> Now would I giue a thousand furlongs of Sea,
77    *for an Acre of barren ground: Long heath, Browne
78    *firrs, any thing; the wills aboue be done, but I would
79     faine dye a dry death.  <D {Exit}.>
80     <Z Scena Secunda.>
81     <D {Enter Prospero and Miranda}.>
82    *<S {Mira}.> If by your #Art (my deerest father) you haue
83     Put the wild waters in this Rore; alay them:
84    *The skye it seemes would powre down stinking pitch,
85     But that the Sea, mounting to th' welkins cheeke,
86     Dashes the fire out. Oh! I haue suffered
87     With those that I saw suffer: A braue vessell
      <P A1v><C D>
88     (Who had no doubt some noble creature in her)
89     Dash'd all to peeces: O the cry did knocke
90     Against my very heart: poore soules, they perish'd.
91     Had I byn any God of power, I would
92     Haue suncke the Sea within the Earth, or ere
93     It should the good Ship so haue swallow'd, and
94     The fraughting Soules within her.
95     <S {Pros}.> Be collected,
96     No more amazement: Tell your pitteous heart
97     there's no harme done.
98     <S {Mira}.> O woe, the day.
99     <S {Pros}.> No harme:
100    I haue done nothing, but in care of thee
101    (Of thee my deere one; thee my daughter) who
102    Art ignorant of what thou art. naught knowing
103    Of whence I am: nor that I am  more better
104    Then {Prospero}, Master of a full poore cell,
105    And thy no greater Father.
106    <S {Mira}.> More to know
107    Did neuer medle with my thoughts.
108    <S {Pros}.> 'Tis time
109    I should informe thee farther: Lend thy hand
110    And plucke my Magick garment from me: So,
111   *Lye there my #Art: wipe thou thine eyes, haue comfort,
112    The direfull spectacle of the wracke which touch'd
113    The very vertue of compassion in thee:
114    I haue with such prouision in mine #Art
115    So safely ordered, that there is no soule
116    No not so much perdition as an hayre
117    Betid to any creature in the vessell
118   *Which thou heardst cry, which thou saw'st sinke: Sit |(downe,
119    For thou must now know farther.
120    <S {Mira}.> You haue often
121    Begun to tell me what I am, but stopt
122    And left me to a bootelesse Inquisition,
123    Concluding, stay: not yet.
124    <S {Pros}.> The howr's now come
125    The very minute byds thee ope thine eare,
126    Obey, and be attentiue. Canst thou remember
127    A time before we came vnto this Cell?
128    I doe not thinke thou canst, for then thou was't not
129    Out three yeeres old.
130    <S {Mira}.> Certainely Sir, I can.
131    <S {Pros}.> By what? by any other house, or person?
132    Of any thing the Image, tell me, that
133    Hath kept with thy remembrance.
134    <S {Mira}.> 'Tis farre off:
135    And rather like a dreame, then an assurance
136    That my remembrance warrants: Had I not
137    Fowre, or fiue women once, that tended me?
138   *<S {Pros}.> Thou hadst; and more {Miranda}: But how is it
139    That this liues in thy minde? What seest thou els
140    In the dark- backward and Abisme of Time?
141    Yf thou remembrest ought ere thou cam'st here,
142    How thou cam'st here thou maist.
143    <S {Mira}.> But that I doe not.
144   *<S {Pros}.> Twelue yere since ({Miranda}) twelue yere since,
145    Thy father was the Duke of {Millaine} and
146    A Prince of power:
147    <S {Mira}.> Sir, are not you my Father?
148    <S {Pros}.> Thy Mother was a peece of vertue, and
149    She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
150    Was Duke of {Millaine}, and his onely heire,
151    And Princesse; no worse Issued.
152    <S {Mira}.> O the heauens,
153    What fowle play had we, that we came from thence?
154    Or blessed #was't we did?
155    <S {Pros}.> Both, both my Girle.
156    By fowle- play (as thou saist) were we heau'd thence,
157    But blessedly holpe hither.
158    <S {Mira}.> O my heart bleedes
159    To thinke oth' teene that I haue turn'd you to,
160    Which is from my remembrance, please you, farther;
161    <S {Pros}.> My brother and thy vncle, call'd {Anthonio}:
162    I pray thee marke me, that a brother should
163    Be so perfidious: he, whom next thy selfe
164    Of all the world I lou'd, and to him put
165    The mannage of my state, as at that time
166    Through all the signories it was the first,
167    And {Prospero}, the prime Duke, being so reputed
168    In dignity; and for the liberall Artes,
169    Without a paralell; those being all my studie,
170    The Gouernment I cast vpon my brother,
171    And to my State grew stranger, being transported
172    And rapt in secret studies, thy false vncle
173    (Do'st thou attend me?)
174    <S {Mira}.> Sir, most heedefully.
175    <S {Pros}.> Being once perfected how to graunt suites,
176    how to deny them: who t' aduance,  and who
177    To trash for ouer- topping; new created
178    The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
179    Or els new form'd 'em; hauing both the key,
180    Of Officer, and office, set all hearts i'th state
181    To what tune pleas'd his eare, that now he was
182    The Iuy which had hid my princely Trunck,
183    And suckt my verdure out on't: Thou attend'st not?
184    <S {Mira}.> O good Sir, I doe.
185    <S {Pros}.> I pray thee marke me:
186    I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
187    To closenes, and the bettering of my mind
188    with that, which but by being so retir'd
189    Ore- priz'd all popular rate: in my false brother
190    Awak'd an euill nature, and my trust
191    Like a good parent, did beget of him
192    A falsehood in it's contrarie, as great
193    As my trust was, which had indeede no limit,
194    A confidence sans bound. He being thus Lorded,
195    Not onely with what my reuenew yeelded,
196    But what my power might els exact. Like one
197    Who hauing into truth, by telling of it,
198    Made such a synner of his memorie
199    To credite his owne lie, he did beleeue
200    He was indeed the Duke, out o'th' Substitution
201    And executing th' outward  face of Roialtie
202    With all prerogatiue: hence his Ambition growing:
203    Do'st thou heare ?
204    <S {Mira}.> Your tale, Sir, would cure deafenesse.
205   *<S {Pros}.> To haue no Schreene between this part he plaid,
206    And him he plaid it for, he needes will be
207    Absolute {Millaine}, Me (poore man) my Librarie
208    Was Dukedome large enough: of temporall roalties
209    He thinks me now incapable. Confederates
210    (so drie he was for Sway) with King of {Naples}
211    To giue him Annuall tribute, doe him homage
212    Subiect his Coronet, to his Crowne and bend
213    The Dukedom yet vnbow'd (alas poore {Millaine})
214    To most ignoble stooping.
215    <S {Mira}.> Oh the heauens:
216   *<S {Pros}.> Marke his condition, and th' euent,  then tell me
217    If this might be a brother.
218    <S {Mira}.> I should sinne
219    To thinke but Noblie of my Grand- mother,
      <P A2><C C>
220    Good wombes haue borne bad sonnes.
221    <S {Pro}.> Now the Condition.
222    This King of {Naples} being an Enemy
223    To me inueterate, hearkens my Brothers suit,
224    Which was, That he in lieu o'th' premises,
225    Of homage, and I know not how much Tribute,
226    Should presently extirpate me and mine
227    Out of the Dukedome, and confer faire {Millaine}
228    With all the Honors, on my brother: Whereon
229    A treacherous Armie leuied, one mid- night
230    Fated to th' purpose,  did {Anthonio} open
231    The gates of {Millaine}, and ith' dead  of darkenesse
232    The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence
233    Me, and thy crying selfe.
234    <S {Mir}.> Alack, for pitty:
235    I not remembring how I cride out then
236    Will cry it ore againe: it is a hint
237    That wrings mine eyes too't.
238    <S {Pro}.> Heare a little further,
239    And then I'le bring thee to the present businesse
240    Which now's vpon's: without the which, this Story
241    Were most impertinent.
242    <S {Mir}.> Wherefore did they not
243    That howre destroy vs?
244    <S {Pro}.> Well demanded, wench:
245   *My Tale prouokes that question: Deare, they durst not,
246    So deare the loue my people bore me: nor set
247    A marke so bloudy on the businesse; but
248    With colours fairer, painted their foule ends.
249    In few, they hurried vs a-boord a Barke,
250    Bore vs some Leagues to Sea, where they prepared
251    A rotten carkasse of a Butt, not rigg'd,
252    Nor tackle, sayle, nor mast, the very rats
253    Instinctiuely haue quit it: There they hoyst vs
254    To cry to th' Sea,  that roard to vs; to sigh
255    To th' windes,  whose pitty sighing backe againe
256    Did vs but louing wrong.
257    <S {Mir}.> Alack, what trouble
258    Was I then to you?
259    <S {Pro}.> O, a Cherubin
260    Thou #was't that did preserue me; Thou didst smile,
261    Infused with a fortitude from heauen,
262    When I haue deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
263    Vnder my burthen groan'd, which rais'd in me
264    An vndergoing stomacke, to beare vp
265    Against what should ensue.
266    <S {Mir}.> How came we #a shore?
267    <S {Pro}.> By prouidence diuine,
268    Some food, we had, and some fresh water, that
269    A noble {Neopolitan Gonzalo}
270    Out of his Charity, (who being then appointed
271    Master of this designe) did giue vs, with
272    Rich garments, linnens, stuffs, and necessaries
273    Which since haue steeded much, so of his gentlenesse
274    Knowing I lou'd my bookes, he furnishd me
275    From mine owne Library, with volumes, that
276    I prize aboue my Dukedome.
277    <S {Mir}.> Would I might
278    But euer see that man.
279    <S {Pro}.> Now I arise,
280    Sit still, and heare the last of our sea- sorrow:
281    Heere in this Iland we arriu'd, and heere
282    Haue I, thy Schoolemaster, made thee more profit
283    Then other Princesse can, that haue more time
284    For vainer howres; and Tutors, not so carefull.
285   *<S {Mir}.> Heuens thank you for't. And now I pray you Sir,
286    For still 'tis beating in my minde; your reason
287    For raysing this Sea- storme?
288    <S {Pro}.> Know thus far forth,
289    By accident most strange, bountifull {Fortune}
290    (Now my deere Lady) hath mine enemies
291    Brought to this shore: And by my prescience
292    I finde my {Zenith} doth depend vpon
293    A most auspitious starre, whose influence
294    If now I court not, but omit; my fortunes
295    Will euer after droope: Heare cease more questions,
296    Thou art inclinde to sleepe: 'tis a good dulnesse,
297    And giue it way: I know thou canst not chuse:
298    Come away, Seruant, come; I am ready now,
299    Approach my {Ariel}. Come.  <D {Enter Ariel}.>
300   *<S {Ari}.> All haile, great Master, graue Sir, haile: I come
301    To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
302    To swim, to diue into the fire: to ride
303    On the curld clowds: to thy strong bidding, taske
304    {Ariel}, and all his Qualitie.
305    <S {Pro}.> Hast thou, Spirit,
306    Performd to point, the Tempest that I #bad thee.
307    <S {Ar}.> To euery Article.
308    I boorded the Kings ship: now on the Beake,
309    Now in the Waste, the Decke, in euery Cabyn,
310    I flam'd amazement, sometime I'ld diuide
311    And burne in many places; on the Top- mast,
312    The Yards and Bore- spritt, would I flame distinctly,
313   *Then meete, and ioyne. {Ioues} Lightning, the precursers
314    O'th dreadfull Thunder- claps more momentarie
315    And sight out- running were not; the fire, and cracks
316    Of sulphurous roaring, the most mighty {Neptune}
317    Seeme to besiege, and make his bold waues tremble,
318    Yea, his dread Trident shake.
319    <S {Pro}.> My braue Spirit,
320    Who was so firme, so constant, that this coyle
321    Would not infect his reason?
322    <S {Ar}.> Not a soule
323    But felt a Feauer of the madde, and plaid
324    Some tricks of desperation; all but Mariners
325    Plung'd in the foaming bryne, and quit the vessell;
326    Then all #a fire with me the Kings sonne {Ferdinand}
327    With haire vp- staring (then like reeds, not haire)
328    Was the first man that leapt; cride #hell is empty,
329    And all the Diuels are heere.
330    <S {Pro}.> Why that's my spirit:
331    But was not this nye shore?
332    <S {Ar}.> Close by, my Master.
333    <S {Pro}.> But are they ({Ariell}) safe?
334    <S {Ar}.> Not a haire perishd:
335    On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
336    But fresher then before: and as thou badst me,
337    In troops I haue dispersd them 'bout the Isle:
338    The Kings sonne haue I landed by himselfe,
339    Whom I left cooling of the Ayre with sighes,
340    In an odde Angle of the Isle, and sitting
341    His armes in this sad knot.
342    <S {Pro}.> Of the Kings ship,
343    The Marriners, say how thou hast disposd,
344    And all the rest o'th' Fleete?
345    <S {Ar}.> Safely in harbour
346    Is the Kings shippe, in the deepe Nooke, where once
347    Thou calldst me vp at midnight to fetch dewe
348    From the still- vext {Bermoothes}, there she's hid;
349    The Marriners all vnder hatches stowed,
350    Who, with a Charme ioynd to their suffred labour
351    I haue left asleep: and for the rest o'th' Fleet
      <P A2v>
352    (Which I dispers'd) they all haue met againe,
353    And are vpon the {Mediterranian} Flote
354    Bound sadly home for {Naples},
355    Supposing that they saw the Kings ship wrackt,
356    And his great person perish.
357    <S {Pro}.> {Ariel}, thy charge
358    Exactly is perform'd; but there's more worke:
359    What is the time o'th' day?
360    <S {Ar}.> Past the mid season.
361   *<S {Pro}.> At least two Glasses: the time 'twixt six & now
362    Must by vs both be spent most preciously.
363   *<S {Ar}.> Is there more toyle? Since y dost giue me pains,
364    Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd,
365    Which is not yet perform'd me.
366    <S {Pro}.> How now? moodie?
367    What is't thou canst demand?
368    <S {Ar}.> My Libertie.
369    <S {Pro}.> Before the time be out? no more:
370    <S {Ar}.> I prethee,
371    Remember I haue done thee worthy seruice,
372    Told thee no lyes, made thee no mistakings, serv'd
373    Without or grudge, or grumblings; thou did promise
374    To bate me a full yeere.
375    <S {Pro}.> Do'st thou forget
376    From what a torment I did free thee?  <S {Ar}.> No.
377   *<S {Pro}.> Thou do'st:  & thinkst it much to tread y Ooze
378    Of the salt deepe;
379    To run vpon the sharpe winde of the North,
380    To doe me businesse in the veines o'th' earth
381    When it is bak'd with frost.
382    <S {Ar}.> I doe not Sir.
383   *<S {Pro}.> Thou liest, malignant Thing: hast thou forgot
384    The fowle Witch {Sycorax}, who with Age and Enuy
385    Was growne into a hoope? hast thou forgot  her?
386    <S {Ar}.> No Sir.
387   *<S {Pro}.> Thou hast: where was she born? speak: tell me:
388    <S {Ar}.> Sir, in {Argier}.
389    <S {Pro}.> Oh, was she so: I must
390    Once in a moneth recount what thou hast bin,
391    Which thou forgetst. This damn'd Witch {Sycorax}
392    For mischiefes manifold, and sorceries terrible
393    To enter humane hearing, from {Argier}
394    Thou know'st was banish'd: for one thing she did
395   *They wold not take her life: Is not this true? <S {Ar}.> #I, Sir.
396   *<S {Pro}.> This blew ey'd hag, was hither brought with |(child,
397    And here was left by th' Saylors;  thou my slaue,
398    As thou reportst thy selfe, was then her seruant,
399    And for thou wast a Spirit too delicate
400    To act her earthy, and abhord commands,
401    Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee
402    By helpe of her more potent Ministers,
403    And in her most vnmittigable rage,
404    Into a clouen Pyne, within which rift
405    Imprison'd, thou didst painefully remaine
406    A dozen yeeres: within which space she #di'd,
407   *And left thee there: where thou didst vent thy groanes
408    As fast as Mill- wheeles strike: Then was this Island
409    (Saue for the Son, that he did littour heere,
410    A frekelld whelpe, hag- borne) not honour'd with
411    A humane shape.
412    <S {Ar}.> Yes: {Caliban} her sonne.
413    <S {Pro}.> Dull thing, I say so: he, that {Caliban}
414    Whom now I keepe in seruice, thou best know'st
415    What torment I did finde thee in; thy grones
416    Did make wolues howle, and penetrate the breasts
417    Of euer- angry Beares; it was a torment
418    To lay vpon the damn'd, which {Sycorax}
419    Could not againe vndoe: it was mine #Art,
420    When I arriu'd, and heard thee, that made gape
421    The Pyne, and let thee out.
422    <S {Ar}.> I thanke thee Master.
423    <S {Pro}.> If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an Oake
424    And peg- thee in his knotty entrailes, till
425    Thou hast howl'd away twelue winters.
426    <S {Ar}.> Pardon, Master,
427    I will be correspondent to command
428    And doe my spryting, gently.
429    <S {Pro}.> Doe so: and after two daies
430    I will discharge thee.
431    <S {Ar}.> That's my noble Master:
432    What shall I doe? say what? what shall I doe?
433    <S {Pro}.> Goe make thy selfe like a Nymph o'th' Sea,
434    Be subiect to no sight but thine, and mine: inuisible
435    To euery eye- ball else: goe take this shape
436    And hither come in't: goe: hence
437    With diligence.  <D {Exit}.>
438   *<S {Pro}.> Awake, deere hart awake, thou hast slept #well,
439    Awake.
440    <S {Mir}.> The strangenes of your story, put
441    Heauinesse in me.
442    <S {Pro}.> Shake it off: Come on,
443    Wee'll visit {Caliban}, my slaue, who neuer
444    Yeelds vs kinde answere.
445   *<S {Mir}.> 'Tis a villaine Sir, I doe not loue to looke on.
446    <S {Pro}.> But as 'tis
447    We cannot misse him: he do's make our fire,
448    Fetch in our wood, and serues in Offices
449    That profit vs: What hoa: slaue: {Caliban}:
450    Thou Earth, thou: speake.
451    <S {Cal}. {within}.> There's wood enough within.
452   *<S {Pro}.> Come forth I say, there's other busines for thee:
453    Come thou Tortoys, when?  <D {Enter Ariel like a water-|#Nymph}.>
454    Fine apparision: my queint {Ariel},
455    Hearke in thine eare.
456    <S {Ar}.> My Lord, it shall be done.  <D {Exit}.>
457   *<S {Pro}.> Thou poysonous slaue, got by y diuell himselfe
458    Vpon thy wicked Dam; come forth.  <D {Enter Caliban}.>
459    <S {Cal}.> As wicked dewe, as ere my mother brush'd
460    With Rauens feather from vnwholesome Fen
461    Drop on you both: A Southwest blow on yee,
462    And blister you all ore.
463   *<S {Pro}.> For this be sure, to night thou shalt haue cramps,
464    Side- stitches, that shall pen thy breath vp, Vrchins
465    Shall for that vast of night, that they may worke
466    All exercise on thee: thou shalt be pinch'd
467    As thicke as hony- combe, each pinch more stinging
468    Then Bees that made 'em.
469    <S {Cal}.> I must eat my dinner:
470    This Island's mine by {Sycorax} my mother,
471    Which thou tak'st from me: when thou cam'st first
472   *Thou stroakst me, & made much of me: wouldst giue me
473    Water with berries in't: and teach me how
474    To name the bigger Light, and how the lesse
475    That burne by day, and night: and then I lou'd thee
476    And shew'd thee all the qualities o'th' Isle,
477    The fresh Springs, Brine- pits; barren place and fertill,
478    Curs'd be I that did so: All the Charmes
479    Of {Sycorax}: Toades, Beetles, Batts light on you:
480    For I am all the Subiects that you haue,
481   *Which first was min owne King: and here you sty- me
482    In this hard Rocke, whiles you doe keepe from me
483    The rest o'th' Island.
      <P A3><C B>
484    <S {Pro}.> Thou most lying slaue,
485    Whom stripes may moue, not kindnes: I haue vs'd thee
486    (Filth as thou art) with humane care, and lodg'd thee
487    In mine owne Cell, till thou didst seeke to violate
488    The honor of my childe.
489    <S {Cal}.> Oh ho, oh ho, would't had bene done:
490    Thou didst preuent me, I had peopel'd else
491    This Isle with {Calibans}.
492    <S {Mira}.> Abhorred Slaue,
493    Which any print of goodnesse wilt not take,
494    Being capable of all #ill: I pittied thee,
495   *Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each houre
496    One thing or other: when thou didst not (Sauage)
497    Know thine owne meaning; but wouldst gabble, like
498    A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
499   *With words that made them knowne: But thy vild race
500   *(Tho thou didst learn) had that in't, which good natures
501    Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
502    Deseruedly confin'd into this Rocke, who hadst
503    Deseru'd more then a prison.
504    <S {Cal}.> You taught me Language, and my profit on't
505    Is, I know how to curse: the red- plague rid you
506    For learning me your language.
507    <S {Pros}.> Hag- seed, hence:
508    Fetch vs in Fewell, and be quicke thou'rt best
509    To answer other businesse: shrug'st thou (Malice)
510    If thou neglectst, or dost vnwillingly
511    What I command, Ile racke thee with old Crampes,
512    Fill all thy bones with Aches, make thee rore,
513    That beasts shall tremble at thy dyn.
514    <S {Cal}.> No, 'pray thee.
515    I must obey, his #Art is of such pow'r,
516    It would controll my Dams god {Setebos},
517    And make a vassaile of him.
518    <S {Pro}.> So slaue, hence.  <D {Exit Cal}.>
519    <D {Enter Ferdinand & Ariel, inuisible playing & singing}.>
520    <S {Ariel} Song.> {Come vnto these yellow sands},
521    {and then take hands:}
522    {Curtsied when you haue, and kist}
523    {the wilde waues whist:}
524    {Foote it featly heere, and there, and sweete Sprights beare}
525    {the burthen}. <D Burthen dispersedly.>
526    {Harke, harke, bowgh wawgh: the watch- Dogges barke},
527    {bowgh- wawgh}.
528   *<S Ar.> {Hark, hark, I heare, the straine of strutting Chanticlere}
529    {cry cockadidle- dowe}.
530   *<S {Fer}.> Where shold this Musick be? I'th aire, or th' earth?
531    It sounds no more: and sure it waytes vpon
532    Some God o'th' Iland,  sitting on a banke,
533    Weeping againe the King my Fathers wracke.
534    This Musicke crept by me vpon the waters,
535    Allaying both their fury, and my passion
536    With it's sweet ayre: thence I haue follow'd it
537    (Or it hath drawne me rather) but 'tis gone.
538    No, it begins againe.
539    <S {Ariell} Song.> {Full fadom fiue thy Father lies},
540    {Of his bones are Corrall made:}
541    {Those are pearles that were his eies},
542    {Nothing of him that doth fade},
543    {But doth suffer a Sea- change}
544    {Into something rich, & strange:}
545    {Sea- Nimphs hourly ring his knell}.
546    <D Burthen:> ding dong.
547    {Harke now I heare them, ding- dong bell}.
548    <S {Fer}.> The Ditty do's remember my drown'd father,
549    This is no mortall busines, nor no sound
550    That the earth owes: I heare it now aboue me.
551    <S {Pro}.> The fringed Curtaines of thine eye aduance,
552    And say what thou see'st yond.
553    <S {Mira}.> What is't a Spirit?
554    Lord, how it lookes about: Beleeue me sir,
555    It carries a braue forme. But 'tis a spirit.
556   *<S {Pro}.> No wench, it eats, and sleeps, & hath such senses
557    As we haue: such. This Gallant which thou seest
558    Was in the wracke: and but hee's something stain'd
559   *With greefe (that's beauties canker) y might'st call him
560    A goodly person: he hath lost his fellowes,
561    And strayes about to finde 'em.
562    <S {Mir}.> I might call him
563    A thing diuine, for nothing naturall
564    I euer saw so Noble.
565    <S {Pro}.> It goes on I see
566    As my soule prompts it: Spirit, fine spirit, Ile free thee
567    Within two dayes for this.
568    <S {Fer}.> Most sure the Goddesse
569    On whom these ayres attend: Vouchsafe my pray'r
570    May know if you remaine vpon this Island,
571    And that you will some good instruction giue
572    How I may beare me heere: my prime request
573    (Which I do last pronounce) is (O you wonder)
574    If you be Mayd, or no?
575    <S {Mir}.> No wonder Sir,
576    But certainly a Mayd.
577    <S {Fer}.> My Language? Heauens:
578    I am the best of them that speake this speech,
579    Were I but where 'tis spoken.
580    <S {Pro}.> How? the best?
581    What wer't thou if the King of {Naples} heard thee?
582    <S {Fer}.> A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
583    To heare thee speake of {Naples}: he do's heare me,
584    And that he do's, I weepe: my selfe am {Naples},
585    Who, with mine eyes (neuer since at ebbe) beheld
586    The King my Father wrack't.
587    <S {Mir}.> Alacke, for mercy.
588   *<S {Fer}.> Yes faith, & all his Lords, the Duke of {Millaine}
589    And his braue sonne, being twaine.
590    <S {Pro}.> The Duke of {Millaine}
591    And his more brauer daughter, could controll thee
592    If now 'twere fit to do't: At the first sight
593    They haue chang'd eyes: Delicate {Ariel},
594    Ile set thee free for this. A word good Sir,
595   *I feare you haue done your selfe some wrong: A word.
596    <S {Mir}.> Why speakes my father so vngently? This
597    Is the third man that ere I saw: the first
598    That ere I sigh'd for: pitty moue my father
599    To be enclin'd my way.
600    <S {Fer}.> O, if a Virgin,
601    And your affection not gone forth, Ile make you
602    The Queene of {Naples}.
603    <S {Pro}.> Soft sir, one word more.
604   *They are both in eythers pow'rs: But this swift busines
605    I must vneasie make, least too light winning
606    Make the prize light. One word more: I charge thee
607    That thou attend me: Thou do'st heere vsurpe
608    The name thou ow'st not, and hast put thy selfe
609    Vpon this Island, as a spy, to win it
610    From me, the Lord on't.
611    <S {Fer}.> No, as I am a man.
612   *<S {Mir}.> Ther's nothing #ill, can dwell in such a Temple,
613    If the ill- spirit haue so fayre a house,
614    Good things will striue to dwell with't.
615    <S {Pro}.> Follow me.
      <P A3v>
616   *<S {Pros}.> Speake not you for him: hee's a Traitor: come,
617    Ile manacle thy necke and feete together:
618    Sea water shalt thou drinke: thy food shall be
619    The fresh- brooke Mussels, wither'd roots, and huskes
620    Wherein the Acorne cradled. Follow.
621    <S {Fer}.> No,
622    I will resist such entertainment, till
623    Mine enemy ha's more pow'r.
624    <D {He drawes, and is charmed from mouing}.>
625    <S {Mira}.> O deere Father,
626    Make not too rash a triall of him, for
627    Hee's gentle, and not fearfull.
628    <S {Pros}.> What I say,
629    My foote my Tutor? Put thy sword vp Traitor,
630   *Who mak'st a shew, but dar'st not strike: thy conscience
631    Is so possest with guilt: Come, from thy ward,
632    For I can heere disarme thee with this sticke,
633    And make thy weapon drop.
634    <S {Mira}.> Beseech you Father.
635    <S {Pros}.> Hence: hang not on my garments.
636    <S {Mira}.> Sir haue pity,
637    Ile be his surety.
638    <S {Pros}.> Silence: One word more
639    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee: What,
640    An aduocate for an Impostor? Hush:
641    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
642    (Hauing seene but him and {Caliban}:) Foolish wench,
643    To th' most of men, this is a {Caliban},
644    And they to him are Angels.
645    <S {Mira}.> My affections
646    Are then most humble: I haue no ambition
647    To see a goodlier man.
648    <S {Pros}.> Come on, obey:
649    Thy Nerues are in their infancy againe.
650    And haue no vigour in them.
651    <S {Fer}.> So they are:
652    My spirits, as in a dreame, are all bound vp:
653    My Fathers losse, the weaknesse which I feele,
654    The wracke of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
655    To whom I am subdude, are but light to me,
656    Might I but through my prison once a day
657    Behold this Mayd: all corners else o'th' Earth
658    Let liberty make vse of: space enough
659    Haue I in such a prison.
660    <S {Pros}.> It workes: Come on.
661    Thou hast done well, fine {Ariell}: follow me,
662    Harke what thou else shalt do mee.
663    <S {Mira}.> Be of comfort,
664    My Fathers of a better nature (Sir)
665    Then he appeares by speech: this is vnwonted
666    Which now came from him.
667    <S {Pros}.> Thou shalt be as free
668    As mountaine windes; but then exactly do
669    All points of my command.
670    <S {Ariell}.> To th' syllable.
671    <S {Pros}.> Come follow: speake not for him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
672    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima}.>
673    <D {Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Gonzalo, Adrian},
674    {Francisco, and others}.>
675    <S {Gonz}.> Beseech you Sir, be merry; you haue cause,
676    (So haue we all) of ioy; for our escape
677    Is much beyond our losse; our hint of woe
678    Is common, euery day, some Saylors wife,
679    The Masters of some Merchant, and the Merchant
680    Haue iust our Theame of woe: But for the miracle,
681    (I meane our preseruation) few in millions
682    Can speake like vs: then wisely (good Sir) weigh
683    Our sorrow, with our comfort.
684    <S {Alons}.> Prethee peace.
685    <S {Seb}.> He receiues comfort like cold porredge.
686    <S {Ant}.> The Visitor will not giue him ore so.
687    <S {Seb}.> Looke, hee's winding vp the watch of his wit,
688    #By and by it will strike.
689    <S {Gon}.> Sir.
690    <S {Seb}.> One: Tell.
691    <S {Gon}.> When euery greefe is entertaind,
692    That's offer'd comes to th' entertainer.
693    <S {Seb}.> A dollor.
694   *<S {Gon}.> Dolour comes to him indeed, you haue spoken
695    truer then you purpos'd.
696   *<S {Seb}.> You haue taken it wiselier then I meant you
697    should.
698    <S {Gon}.> Therefore my Lord.
699    <S {Ant}.> Fie, what a spend- thrift is he of his tongue.
700    <S {Alon}.> I pre- thee spare.
701    <S {Gon}.> Well, I haue done: But yet
702    <S {Seb}.> He will be talking.
703    <S {Ant}.> Which, of he, or Adrian, for a good wager,
704    First begins to crow?
705    <S {Seb}.> The old Cocke.
706    <S {Ant}.> The Cockrell.
707    <S {Seb}.> Done: The wager?
708    <S {Ant}.> A Laughter.
709    <S {Seb}.> A match.
710    <S {Adr}.> Though this Island seeme to be desert.
711    <S {Seb}.> Ha, ha, ha.
712    <S {Ant}.> So: #you'r paid.
713    <S {Adr}.> Vninhabitable, and almost inaccessible.
714    <S {Seb}.> Yet
715    <S {Adr}.> Yet
716    <S {Ant}.> He could not misse't.
717   *<S {Adr}.> It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
718    temperance.
719    <S {Ant}.> {Temperance} was a delicate wench.
720    <S {Seb}.> #I, and a subtle, as he most learnedly deliuer'd.
721    <S {Adr}.> The ayre breathes vpon vs here most sweetly.
722    <S {Seb}.> As if it had Lungs, and rotten ones.
723    <S {Ant}.> Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a Fen.
724    <S {Gon}.> Heere is euery thing aduantageous to life.
725    <S {Ant}.> True, saue meanes to liue.
726    <S {Seb}.> Of that there's none, or little.
727    <S {Gon}.> How lush and lusty the grasse lookes?
728    How greene?
729    <S {Ant}.> The ground indeed is tawny.
730    <S {Seb}.> With an eye of greene in't.
731    <S {Ant}.> He misses not much.
732    <S {Seb}.> No: he doth but mistake the truth totally.
733   *<S {Gon}.> But the rariety of it is, which is indeed almost
734    beyond credit.
735    <S {Seb}.> As many voucht rarieties are.
736   *<S {Gon}.> That our Garments being (as they were) drencht
737   *in the Sea, hold notwithstanding their freshnesse and
738   *glosses, being rather new dy'de then stain'd with salte
739    water.
740   *<S {Ant}.> If but one of his pockets could speake, would
741    it not say he lyes?
742    <S {Seb}.> #I, or very falsely pocket vp his report.
      <P A4>
743   *<S {Gon}.> Me thinkes our garments are now as fresh as
744   *when we put them on first in Affricke, at the marriage
745   *of the kings faire daughter {Claribel} to the king of {Tunis}.
746   *<S {Seb}.> 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
747    our returne.
748   *<S {Adri}.> {Tunis} was neuer grac'd before with such a Pa-ragon
749    to their Queene.
750    <S {Gon}.> Not since widdow {Dido's} time.
751   *<S {Ant}.> Widow? A pox o'that: how came that Wid-dow
752    in? Widdow {Dido}!
753    <S {Seb}.> What if he had said Widdower {Aeneas} too?
754    Good Lord,  how you take it?
755   *<S {Adri}.> Widdow {Dido} said you? You make me study
756    of that: She was of {Carthage}, not of {Tunis}.
757    <S {Gon}.> This {Tunis} Sir was {Carthage}.
758    <S {Adri}.> {Carthage}? <S {Gon}.> I assure you {Carthage}.
759   *<S {Ant}.> His word is more then the miraculous Harpe.
760    <S {Seb}.> He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
761   *<S {Ant}.> What impossible matter wil he make easy next?
762   *<S {Seb}.> I thinke hee will carry this Island home in his
763    pocket, and giue it his sonne for an Apple.
764   *<S {Ant}.> And sowing the kernels of it in the Sea, bring
765    forth more Islands.
766    <S {Gon}.> #I. <S {Ant}.> Why in good time.
767   *<S {Gon}.> Sir, we were talking, that our garments seeme
768   *now as fresh as when we were at {Tunis} at the marriage
769    of your daughter, who is now Queene.
770    <S {Ant}.> And the rarest that ere came there.
771    <S {Seb}.> Bate (I beseech you) widdow {Dido}.
772    <S {Ant}.> O Widdow {Dido}? #I, Widdow {Dido}.
773   *<S {Gon}.> Is not Sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I
774    wore it? I meane in a sort.
775    <S {Ant}.> That sort was well fish'd for.
776    <S {Gon}.> When I wore it at your daughters marriage.
777   *<S {Alon}.> You cram these words into mine eares, against
778    the stomacke of my sense: would I had neuer
779    Married my daughter there: For comming thence
780    My sonne is lost, and (in my rate) she too,
781    Who is so farre from {Italy} remoued,
782    I ne're againe shall see her: O thou mine heire
783    Of {Naples} and of {Millaine}, what strange fish
784    Hath made his meale on thee?
785    <S {Fran}.> Sir he may liue,
786    I saw him beate the surges vnder him,
787    And ride vpon their backes; he trod the water
788    Whose enmity he flung aside: and brested
789    The surge most swolne that met him: his bold head
790    'Boue the contentious waues he kept, and oared
791    Himselfe with his good armes in lusty stroke
792    To th' shore; that ore his waue- worne basis bowed
793    As stooping to releeue him: I not doubt
794    He came aliue to Land.
795    <S {Alon}.> No, no, hee's gone.
796   *<S {Seb}.> Sir you may thank your selfe for this great losse,
797   *That would not blesse our Europe with your daughter,
798    But rather loose her to an Affrican,
799    Where she at least, is banish'd from your eye,
800    Who hath cause to wet the greefe on't.
801    <S {Alon}.> Pre- thee peace.
802   *<S {Seb}.> You were kneel'd #too, & importun'd otherwise
803    By all of vs: and the faire soule her selfe
804    Waigh'd betweene loathnesse, and obedience, at
805   *Which end o'th' beame  should bow: we haue lost your |(son,
806    I feare for euer: {Millaine} and {Naples} haue
807    Mo widdowes in them of this businesse making,
808    Then we bring men to comfort them:
809    The faults your owne.
810    <S {Alon}.> So is the deer'st oth' losse.
811    <S {Gon}.> My Lord {Sebastian},
812    The truth you speake doth lacke some gentlenesse,
813    And time to speake it in: you rub the sore,
814    When you should bring the plaister.
815    <S {Seb}.> Very well. <S {Ant}.> And most Chirurgeonly.
816    <S {Gon}.> It is foule weather in vs all, good Sir,
817    When you are cloudy.
818    <S {Seb}.> Fowle weather? <S {Ant}.> Very foule.
819    <S {Gon}.> Had I plantation of this Isle my Lord.
820    <S {Ant}.> Hee'd sow't with Nettle- seed.
821    <S {Seb}.> Or dockes, or Mallowes.
822    <S {Gon}.> And were the King on't, what would I do?
823    <S {Seb}.> Scape being drunke, for want of Wine.
824   *<S {Gon}.> I'th' Commonwealth  I would (by contraries)
825    Execute all things: For no kinde of Trafficke
826    Would I admit: No name of Magistrate:
827    Letters should not be knowne: Riches, pouerty,
828    And vse of seruice, none: Contract, Succession,
829    Borne, bound of Land, Tilth, Vineyard none:
830    No vse of Mettall, Corne, or Wine, or Oyle:
831    No occupation, all men idle, all:
832    And Women too, but innocent and pure:
833    No Soueraignty.
834    <S {Seb}.> Yet he would be King on't.
835   *<S {Ant}.> The latter end of his Common- wealth forgets
836    the beginning.
837   *<S {Gon}.> All things in common Nature should produce
838    Without sweat or endeuour: Treason, fellony,
839    Sword, Pike, Knife, Gun, or neede of any Engine
840    Would I not haue: but Nature should bring forth
841    Of #it owne kinde, all foyzon, all abundance
842    To feed my innocent people.
843    <S {Seb}.> No marrying 'mong his subiects?
844    <S {Ant}.> None (man) all idle; Whores and knaues,
845    <S {Gon}.> I would with such perfection gouerne Sir:
846    T' Excell  the Golden Age.
847    <S {Seb}.> 'Saue his Maiesty. <S {Ant}.> Long liue {Gonzalo}.
848    <S {Gon}.> And do you marke me, Sir?
849   *<S {Alon}.> Pre- thee no more: thou dost talke nothing to |(me.
850   *<S {Gon}.> I do #well beleeue your Highnesse, and did it
851   *to minister occasion to these Gentlemen, who are of
852   *such sensible and nimble Lungs, that they alwayes vse
853    to laugh at nothing.
854    <S {Ant}.> 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
855   *<S {Gon}.> Who, in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
856   *to you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.
857    <S {Ant}.> What a blow was there giuen?
858    <S {Seb}.> #And it had not falne flat- long.
859   *<S {Gon}.> You are Gentlemen of braue mettal: you would
860   *lift the Moone out of her spheare, if she would continue
861    in it fiue weekes without changing.
862    <D {Enter Ariell playing solemne Musicke}.>
863    <S {Seb}.> We would so, and then go #a Bat- fowling.
864    <S {Ant}.> Nay good my Lord, be not angry.
865   *<S {Gon}.> No I warrant you, I will not aduenture my
866   *discretion so weakly: Will you laugh me asleepe, for I
867    am very heauy.
868    <S {Ant}.> Go sleepe, and heare vs.
869    <S {Alon}.> What, all so soone asleepe? I wish mine eyes
870    Would (with themselues) shut vp my thoughts,
871    I finde they are inclin'd to do so.
872    <S {Seb}.> Please you Sir,
873    Do not omit the heauy offer of it:
874   *It sildome visits sorrow, when it doth, it is a Comforter.
      <P A4v>
875    <S {Ant}.> We two my Lord, will guard your person,
876    While you take your rest, and watch your safety.
877    <S {Alon}.> Thanke you: Wondrous heauy.
878    <S {Seb}.> What a strange drowsines possesses them?
879    <S {Ant}.> It is the quality o'th' Clymate.
880    <S {Seb}.> Why
881    Doth it not then our eye- lids sinke? I finde
882    Not my selfe dispos'd to sleep.
883    <S {Ant}.> Nor I, my spirits are nimble:
884    They fell together all, as by consent
885    They dropt, as by a Thunder- stroke: what might
886    Worthy {Sebastian}? O, what might? no more:
887    And yet, me thinkes I see it in thy face,
888    What thou should'st be: th' occasion  speaks thee, and
889    My strong imagination see's a Crowne
890    Dropping vpon thy head.
891    <S {Seb}.> What? art thou waking?
892    <S {Ant}.> Do you not heare me speake?
893    <S {Seb}.> I do, and surely
894    It is a sleepy Language; and thou speak'st
895    Out of thy sleepe: What is it thou didst say?
896    This is a strange repose, to be asleepe
897    With eyes wide open: standing, speaking, mouing:
898    And yet so fast asleepe.
899    <S {Ant}.> Noble {Sebastian},
900    Thou let'st thy fortune sleepe: die rather: wink'st
901    Whiles thou art waking.
902    <S {Seb}.> Thou do'st snore distinctly,
903    There's meaning in thy snores.
904    <S {Ant}.> I am more serious then my custome: you
905    Must be so too, if heed me: which to do,
906    Trebbles thee o're.
907    <S {Seb}.> Well: I am standing water.
908    <S {Ant}.> Ile teach you how to flow.
909    <S {Seb}.> Do so: to ebbe
910    Hereditary Sloth instructs me.
911    <S {Ant}.> O!
912    If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
913    Whiles thus you mocke it: how in stripping it
914    You more inuest it: ebbing men, indeed
915    (Most often) do so neere the bottome run
916    By their owne feare, or sloth.
917    <S {Seb}.> 'Pre- thee say on,
918    The setting of thine eye, and cheeke proclaime
919    A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
920    Which throwes thee much to yeeld.
921    <S {Ant}.> Thus Sir:
922    Although this Lord of weake remembrance; this
923    Who shall be of as little memory
924    When he is earth'd, hath here almost perswaded
925    (For hee's a Spirit of perswasion, onely
926    Professes to perswade) the King his sonne's aliue,
927    'Tis as impossible that hee's vndrown'd,
928    As he that sleepes heere, swims.
929    <S {Seb}.> I haue no hope
930    That hee's vndrown'd.
931    <S {Ant}.> O, out of that no hope,
932    What great hope haue you? No hope that way, Is
933    Another way so high a hope, that euen
934    Ambition cannot pierce a winke beyond
935    But doubt discouery there. Will you grant with me
936    That {Ferdinand} is drown'd.
937    <S {Seb}.> He's gone.
938    <S {Ant}.> Then tell me, who's the next heire of {Naples}?
939    <S {Seb}.> {Claribell}.
940    <S {Ant}.> She that is Queene of {Tunis}: she that dwels
941    Ten leagues beyond mans life: she that from {Naples}
942    Can haue no note, vnlesse the Sun were post:
943   *The Man i'th Moone's too slow, till new- borne chinnes
944    Be rough, and Razor- able: She that from whom
945    We all were sea- swallow'd, though some cast againe,
946    (And by that destiny) to performe an act
947    Whereof, what's past is Prologue; what to come
948    In yours, and my discharge.
949    <S {Seb}.> What stuffe is this? How say you?
950    'Tis true my brothers daughter's Queene of {Tunis},
951    So is she heyre of {Naples}, 'twixt which Regions
952    There is some space.
953    <S {Ant}.> A space, whose eu'ry cubit
954    Seemes to cry out, how shall that {Claribell}
955    Measure vs backe to {Naples}? keepe in {Tunis},
956    And let {Sebastian} wake. Say, this were death
957    That now hath seiz'd them, why they were no worse
958    Then now they are: There be that can rule {Naples}
959    As well as he that sleepes: Lords, that can prate
960    As amply, and vnnecessarily
961    As this {Gonzallo}: I my selfe could make
962    A Chough of as deepe chat: O, that you bore
963    The minde that I do; what a sleepe were this
964    For your aduancement? Do you vnderstand me?
965    <S {Seb}.> Me thinkes I do.
966    <S {Ant}.> And how do's your content
967    Tender your owne good fortune?
968    <S {Seb}.> I remember
969    You did supplant your Brother {Prospero}.
970    <S {Ant}.> True:
971    And looke how well my Garments sit vpon me,
972    Much feater then before: My Brothers seruants
973    Were then my fellowes, now they are my men.
974    <S {Seb}.> But for your conscience.
975    <S {Ant}.> #I Sir: where lies that? If 'twere a kybe
976    'Twould put me to my slipper: But I feele not
977    This Deity in my bosome: 'Twentie consciences
978    That stand 'twixt me, and {Millaine}, candied be they,
979    And melt ere they mollest: Heere lies your Brother,
980    No better then the earth he lies vpon,
981    If he were that which now hee's like (that's dead)
982    Whom I with this obedient steele (three inches of it)
983    Can lay to bed for euer: whiles you doing thus,
984    To the perpetuall winke for aye might put
985    This ancient morsell: this Sir Prudence, who
986    Should not vpbraid our course: for all the rest
987    They'l take suggestion, as a Cat laps milke,
988    They'l tell the clocke, to any businesse that
989    We say befits the houre.
990    <S {Seb}.> Thy case, deere Friend
991    Shall be my president: As thou got'st {Millaine},
992    I'le come by {Naples}: Draw thy sword, one stroke
993    Shall free thee from the tribute which thou paiest,
994    And I the King shall loue thee.
995    <S {Ant}.> Draw together:
996    And when I reare my hand, do you the like
997    To fall it on {Gonzalo}.
998    <S {Seb}.> O, but one word.
999    <D {Enter Ariell with Musicke and Song}.>
1000  *<S {Ariel}.> My Master through his #Art foresees the danger
1001   That you (his friend) are in, and sends me forth
1002   (For else his proiect dies) to keepe them liuing.
1003   <D {Sings in Gonzaloes eare}.>

1008   {Shake off slumber and beware}.
1009   {Awake, awake}.
1010   <S {Ant}.> Then let vs both be sodaine.
1011   <S {Gon}.> Now, good Angels preserue the King.
1012  *<S {Alo}.> Why how now hoa; awake? why are you drawn?
1013   Wherefore this ghastly looking?
1014   <S {Gon}.> What's the matter?
1015   <S {Seb}.> Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
1016   (Euen now) we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
1017   Like Buls, or rather Lyons, did't not wake you?
1018   It strooke mine eare most terribly.
1019   <S {Alo}.> I heard nothing.
1020   <S {Ant}.> O, 'twas a din to fright a Monsters eare;
1021   To make an earthquake: sure it was the roare
1022   Of a whole heard of Lyons.
1023   <S {Alo}.> Heard you this {Gonzalo}?
1024   <S {Gon}.> Vpon mine honour, Sir, I heard a humming,
1025   (And that a strange one too) which did awake me:
1026   I shak'd you Sir, and cride: as mine eyes opend,
1027   I saw their weapons drawne: there was a noyse,
1028   That's verily: 'tis best we stand vpon our guard;
1029   Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons.
1030  *<S {Alo}.> Lead off this ground & let's make further search
1031   For my poore sonne.
1032   <S {Gon}.> Heauens keepe him from these Beasts:
1033   For he is sure i'th Island.
1034   <S {Alo}.> Lead away.
1035  *<S {Ariell}.> {Prospero} my Lord, shall know what I haue |(done.
1036   So (King) goe safely on to seeke thy Son.  <D {Exeunt}.>

1040   <S {Cal}.> All the infections that the Sunne suckes vp
1041   From Bogs, Fens, Flats, on {Prosper} fall, and make him
1042   By ynch- meale a disease: his Spirits heare me,
1043   And yet I needes must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
1044   Fright me with Vrchyn- shewes, pitch me i'th mire,
1045   Nor lead me like a fire- brand, in the darke
1046   Out of my way, vnlesse he bid 'em;  but
1047   For euery trifle, are they set vpon me,
1048   Sometime like Apes, that moe and chatter at me,
1049   And after bite me: then like Hedg- hogs, which
1050   Lye tumbling in my bare- foote way, and mount
1051   Their pricks at my foot- fall: sometime am I
1052   All wound with Adders, who with clouen tongues
1053   Doe hisse me into madnesse: Lo, now Lo, <D {Enter} | {Trinculo}.>
1054   Here comes a Spirit of his, and to torment me
1055   For bringing wood in slowly: I'le fall flat,
1056   Perchance he will not minde me.
1057  *<S {Tri}.> Here's neither bush, nor shrub to beare off any
1058  *weather at all: and another Storme brewing, I heare it
1059  *sing ith' winde: yond same blacke cloud, yond huge
1060  *one, lookes like a foule bumbard that would shed his
1061  *licquor: if it should thunder, as it did before, I know
1062  *not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
1063  *choose but fall by paile-fuls. What haue we here, a man,
1064  *or a fish? dead or aliue? a fish, hee smels like a fish: a
1065  *very ancient and fish- like smell: a kinde of, not of the
1066  *newest poore- Iohn: a strange fish: were I in {England}
1067  *now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted; not
1068  *a holiday- foole there but would giue a peece of siluer:
1069  *there, would this Monster, make a man: any strange
1070  *beast there, makes a man: when they will not giue a
1071  *doit to relieue a lame Begger, they will lay out ten to see
1072  *a dead {Indian}: Leg'd like a man; and his Finnes like
1073  *Armes: warme o'my troth: I doe now let loose my o-pinion;
1074  *hold it no longer; this is no fish, but an Islan-der,

1076  *the storme is come againe: my best way is to creepe vn-der
1077  *his Gaberdine: there is no other shelter herea-bout:
1078  *Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfel-lowes:

1126  *mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and
1127  *that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend; open
1128   your chaps againe.
1129   <S {Tri}.> I should know that voyce:
1130   It should be,
      <P A5v>
1131  *But hee is dround; and these are diuels; O de-fend
1132   me.
1133  *<S {Ste}.> Foure legges and two voyces; a most delicate
1134  *Monster: his forward voyce now is to speake well of
1135  *his friend; his backward voice, is to vtter foule speeches,
1136  *and to detract: if all the wine in my bottle will recouer
1137  *him, I will helpe his Ague: Come: Amen, I will
1138   poure some in thy other mouth.
1139   <S {Tri}.> {Stephano}.
1140  *<S {Ste}.> Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy:
1141  *This is a diuell, and no Monster: I will leaue him, I
1142   haue no long Spoone.
1143  *<S {Tri}.> {Stephano}: if thou beest {Stephano}, touch me, and
1144  *speake to me: for I am {Trinculo}; be not afeard, thy
1145   good friend {Trinculo}.
1146  *<S {Ste}.> If thou bee'st {Trinculo}: come forth: I'le pull
1147  *thee by the lesser legges: if any be {Trinculo's} legges,
1148  *these are they: Thou art very {Trinculo} indeede: how
1149  *cam'st thou to be the siege of this Moone- calfe? Can
1150   he vent {Trinculo's}?
1151  *<S {Tri}.> I tooke him to be kil'd with a thunder- strok; but
1152  *art thou not dround {Stephano}: I hope now thou art
1153  *not dround: Is the Storme ouer- blowne? I hid mee
1154  *vnder the dead Moone- Calfes Gaberdine, for feare of
1155  *the Storme: And art thou liuing {Stephano}? O {Stephano},
1156   two {Neapolitanes} scap'd?
1157  *<S {Ste}.> 'Prethee doe not turne me about, my stomacke
1158   is not constant.
1159  *<S {Cal}.> These be fine things, #and if they be not sprights:
1160  *that's a braue God, and beares Celestiall liquor: I will
1161   kneele to him.
1162   <S {Ste}.> How did'st thou scape?
1163   How cam'st thou hither?
1164  *Sweare by this Bottle how thou cam'st hither: I escap'd
1165  *vpon a #But of Sacke, which the Saylors heaued o're-boord,
1166  *by this Bottle which I made of the barke of
1167   a Tree, with mine owne hands, since I was cast a'-shore.
1168  _
1169  *<S {Cal}.> I'le sweare vpon that Bottle, to be thy true sub-iect,
1170   for the liquor is not earthly.
1171   <S {St}.> Heere: sweare then how thou escap'dst.
1172  *<S {Tri}.> Swom ashore (man) like a Ducke: I can swim
1173   like a Ducke i'le be sworne.
1174   <S {Ste}.> Here, kisse the Booke.
1175  *Though thou canst swim like a Ducke, thou art made
1176   like a Goose.
1177   <S {Tri}.> O {Stephano}, ha'st any more of this?
1178  *<S {Ste}.> The whole #But (man) my Cellar is in a rocke
1179   by th' sea- side, where my Wine is hid:
1180   How now Moone- Calfe, how do's thine Ague?
1181   <S {Cal}.> Ha'st thou not dropt from heauen?
1182  *<S {Ste}.> Out o'th Moone I doe assure thee. I was the
1183   Man ith' Moone, when time was.
1184  *<S {Cal}.> I haue seene thee in her: and I doe adore thee:
1185  *My Mistris shew'd me thee, and thy Dog, and thy Bush.
1186  *<S {Ste}.> Come, sweare to that: kisse the Booke: I will
1187   furnish it anon with new Contents: Sweare.
1188  *<S {Tri}.> By this good light, this is a very shallow Mon-ster:
1189   I afeard of him? a very weake Monster:
1190   The Man ith' Moone?
1191   A most poore creadulous Monster:
1192   Well drawne Monster, in good sooth.
1193  *<S {Cal}.> Ile shew thee euery fertill ynch o'th Island: and
1194   I will kisse thy foote: I prethee be my god.
1195  *<S {Tri}.> By this light, a most perfidious, and drunken
1196   Monster, when's god's #a sleepe he'll rob his Bottle.
1197  *<S {Cal}.> Ile kisse thy foot, Ile sweare my selfe thy Subiect.
1198   <S {Ste}.> Come on then: downe and sweare.
1199  *<S {Tri}.> I shall laugh my selfe to death at this puppi- hea-ded
1200  *Monster: a most scuruie Monster: I could finde in
1201   my heart to beate him.
1202   <S {Ste}.> Come, kisse.
1203   <S {Tri}.> But that the poore Monster's in drinke:
1204   An abhominable Monster.
1205  *<S {Cal}.> I'le shew thee the best Springs: I'le plucke thee
1206  *Berries: I'le fish for thee; and get thee wood enough.
1207   A plague vpon the Tyrant that I serue;
1208  *I'le beare him no more Stickes, but follow thee, thou
1209   wondrous man.
1210  *<S {Tri}.> A most rediculous Monster, to make a wonder of
1211   a poore drunkard.
1212  *<S {Cal}.> I 'prethee let me bring thee where Crabs grow;
1213  *and I with my long nayles will digge thee pig- nuts;
1214  *show thee a Iayes nest, and instruct thee how to snare
1215  *the nimble Marmazet: I'le bring thee to clustring
1216  *Philbirts, and sometimes I'le get thee young Scamels
1217   from the Rocke: Wilt thou goe with me?
1218  *<S {Ste}.> I pre'thee now lead the way without any more
1219  *talking. {Trinculo}, the King, and all our company else
1220  *being dround, wee will inherit here: Here; beare my
1221  *Bottle: Fellow {Trinculo}; we'll fill him #by and by a-gaine.

1223   <D {Caliban Sings drunkenly}.>
1224   Farewell Master; farewell, farewell.
1225   <S {Tri}.> A howling Monster: a drunken Monster.

1234   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scoena Prima}.>
1235   <D {Enter Ferdinand (bearing a Log.)}>
1236  *<S {Fer}.> There be some Sports are painfull; & their labor
1237   Delight in them set off: Some kindes of basenesse
1238   Are nobly vndergon; and most poore matters
1239   Point to rich ends: this my meane Taske
1240   Would be as heauy to me, as odious, but
1241   The Mistris which I serue, quickens what's dead,
1242   And makes my labours, pleasures: O She is
1243   Ten times more gentle, then her Father's crabbed;
1244   And he's compos'd of harshnesse. I must remoue
1245   Some thousands of these Logs, and pile them vp,
1246   Vpon a sore iniunction; my sweet Mistris
1247  *Weepes when she sees me worke, & saies,  such basenes
1248   Had neuer like Executor: I forget:
1249  *But these sweet thoughts, doe euen refresh my labours,
1250   Most busie lest, when I doe it.  <D {Enter Miranda} | {and Prospero}.>
1251   <S {Mir}.> Alas, now pray you
1252   Worke not so hard: I would the lightning had
1253   Burnt vp those Logs that you are enioynd to pile:
1254   Pray set it downe, and rest you: when this burnes
1255   'Twill weepe for hauing wearied you: my Father
1256   Is hard at study; pray now rest your selfe,
      <P A6><C B>
1257   Hee's safe for these three houres.
1258   <S {Fer}.> O most deere Mistris
1259   The Sun will set before I shall discharge
1260   What I must striue to do.
1261   <S {Mir}.> If you'l sit downe
1262   Ile beare your Logges the while: pray giue me that,
1263   Ile carry it to the pile.
1264   <S {Fer}.> No precious Creature,
1265   I had rather cracke my sinewes, breake my backe,
1266   Then you should such dishonor vndergoe,
1267   While I sit lazy by.
1268   <S {Mir}.> It would become me
1269   As well as it do's you; and I should do it
1270   With much more ease: for my good #will is to it,
1271   And yours it is against.
1272   <S {Pro}.> Poore worme thou art infected,
1273   This visitation shewes it.
1274   <S {Mir}.> You looke wearily.
1275  *<S {Fer}.> No, noble Mistris, 'tis fresh morning with me
1276   When you are by at night: I do beseech you
1277   Cheefely, that I might set it in my prayers,
1278   What is your name?
1279   <S {Mir}.> {Miranda}, O my Father,
1280   I haue broke your hest to say so.
1281   <S {Fer}.> Admir'd {Miranda},
1282   Indeede the top of Admiration, worth
1283   What's deerest to the world: full many a Lady
1284   I haue ey'd with best regard, and many a time
1285   Th' harmony  of their tongues, hath into bondage
1286   Brought my too diligent eare: for seuerall vertues
1287   Haue I lik'd seuerall women, neuer any
1288   With so full soule, but some defect in her
1289   Did quarrell with the noblest grace she ow'd,
1290   And put it to the foile. But you, O you,
1291   So perfect, and so peerlesse, are created
1292   Of euerie Creatures best.
1293   <S {Mir}.> I do not know
1294   One of my sexe; no womans face remember,
1295   Saue from my glasse, mine owne: Nor haue I seene
1296   More that I may call men, then you good friend,
1297   And my deere Father: how features are abroad
1298   I am skillesse of; but by my modestie
1299   (The iewell in my dower) I would not wish
1300   Any Companion in the world but you:
1301   Nor can imagination forme a shape
1302   Besides your selfe, to like of: but I prattle
1303   Something too wildely, and my Fathers precepts
1304   I therein do forget.
1305   <S {Fer}.> I am, in my condition
1306   A Prince ({Miranda}) I do thinke a King
1307   (I would not so) and would no more endure
1308   This wodden slauerie, then to suffer
1309  *The flesh- flie blow my mouth: heare my soule speake.
1310   The verie instant that I saw you, did
1311   My heart flie to your seruice, there resides
1312   To make me slaue to it, and for your sake
1313   Am I this patient Logge- man.
1314   <S {Mir}.> Do you loue me?
1315  *<S {Fer}.> O heauen; O earth, beare witnes to this sound,
1316   And crowne what I professe with kinde euent
1317   If I speake true: if hollowly, inuert
1318   What best is boaded me, to mischiefe: I,
1319   Beyond all limit of what else i'th world
1320   Do loue, prize, honor you.
1321   <S {Mir}.> I am a foole
1322   To weepe at what I am glad of.
1323   <S {Pro}.> Faire encounter
1324   Of two most rare affections: heauens raine grace
1325   On that which breeds betweene 'em.
1326   <S {Fer}.> Wherefore weepe you?
1327   <S {Mir}.> At mine vnworthinesse, that dare not offer
1328   What I desire to giue; and much lesse take
1329   What I shall die to want: But this is trifling,
1330   And all the more it seekes to hide it selfe,
1331   The bigger bulke it shewes. Hence bashfull cunning,
1332   And prompt me plaine and holy innocence.
1333   I am your wife, if you will marrie me;
1334   If not, Ile die your maid: to be your fellow
1335   You may denie me, but Ile be your seruant
1336   Whether you will or no.
1337   <S {Fer}.> My Mistris (deerest)
1338   And I thus humble euer.
1339   <S {Mir}.> My husband then?
1340   <S {Fer}.> #I, with a heart as willing
1341   As bondage ere of freedome: heere's my hand.
1342  *<S {Mir}.> And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewel
1343   Till halfe an houre hence.
1344   <S {Fer}.> A thousand, thousand.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1345   <S {Pro}.> So glad of this as they I cannot be,
1346   Who are surpriz'd with all; but my reioycing
1347   At nothing can be more: Ile to my booke,
1348   For yet ere supper time, must I performe
1349   Much businesse appertaining.  <D {Exit}.>
1350   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1351   <D {Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo}.>
1352  *<S {Ste}.> Tell not me, when the #But is out we will drinke
1353  *water, not a drop before; therefore beare vp, & boord
1354   em' Seruant Monster, drinke to me.
1355  *<S {Trin}.> Seruant Monster? the folly of this Iland, they
1356  *say there's but fiue vpon this Isle; we are three of them,
1357   if th' other  two be brain'd like vs, the State totters.
1358  *<S {Ste}.> Drinke seruant Monster when I bid thee, thy
1359   eies are almost set in thy head.
1360  *<S {Trin}.> Where should they bee set else? hee were a
1361   braue Monster indeede if they were set in his taile.
1362  *<S {Ste}.> My man- Monster hath drown'd his tongue in
1363  *sacke: for my part the Sea cannot drowne mee, I swam
1364  *ere I could recouer the shore, fiue and thirtie Leagues
1365  *off and on, by this light thou shalt bee my Lieutenant
1366   Monster, or my Standard.
1367   <S {Trin}.> Your Lieutenant if you list, hee's no standard.
1368   <S {Ste}.> Weel not run Monsieur Monster.
1369  *<S {Trin}.> Nor go neither: but you'l lie like dogs, and yet
1370   say nothing neither.
1371  *<S {Ste}.> Moone- calfe, speak once in thy life, if thou beest
1372   a good Moone- calfe.
1373  *<S {Cal}.> How does thy honour? Let me licke thy shooe:
1374   Ile not serue him, he is not valiant.
1375  *<S {Trin}.> Thou liest most ignorant Monster, I am in case
1376  *to iustle a Constable: why, thou debosh'd Fish thou,
1377  *was there euer man a Coward, that hath drunk so much
1378  *Sacke as I to day? wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being
1379   but halfe a Fish, and halfe a Monster?
1380  *<S {Cal}.> Loe, how he mockes me, wilt thou let him my
1381   Lord?
      <P A6v>
1382  *<S {Trin}.> Lord, quoth he? that a Monster should be such
1383   a Naturall?
1384   <S {Cal}.> Loe, loe againe: bite him to death I prethee.
1385  *<S {Ste}.> {Trinculo}, keepe a good tongue in your head: If
1386  *you proue a mutineere, the next Tree: the poore Mon-ster's
1387   my subiect, and he shall not suffer  indignity.
1388  *<S {Cal}.> I thanke my noble Lord. Wilt thou be pleas'd
1389   to hearken once againe to the suite I made to thee?
1390   <S {Ste}.> Marry will I: kneele, and repeate it,
1391   I will stand, and so shall {Trinculo}.
1392   <D {Enter Ariell inuisible}.>
1393  *<S {Cal}.> As I told thee before, I am subiect to a Tirant,
1394   A Sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me
1395   Of the Island.
1396   <S {Ariell}.> Thou lyest.
1397   <S {Cal}.> Thou lyest, thou iesting Monkey thou:
1398   I would my valiant Master would destroy thee.
1399   I do not lye.
1400   <S {Ste}.> {Trinculo}, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
1401   By this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
1402   <S {Trin}.> Why, I said nothing.
1403   <S {Ste}.> Mum then, and no more: proceed.
1404   <S {Cal}.> I say by Sorcery he got this Isle
1405   From me, he got it. If thy Greatnesse will
1406   Reuenge it on him, (for I know thou dar'st)
1407   But this Thing dare not.
1408   <S {Ste}.> That's most certaine.
1409   <S {Cal}.> Thou shalt be Lord of it, and Ile serue thee.
1410   <S {Ste}.> How now shall this be compast?
1411   Canst thou bring me to the party?
1412  *<S {Cal}.> Yea, yea my Lord, Ile yeeld him thee asleepe,
1413   Where thou maist knocke a naile into his head.
1414   <S {Ariell}.> Thou liest, thou canst not.
1415  *<S {Cal}.> What a py'de Ninnie's this? Thou scuruy patch:
1416   I do beseech thy Greatnesse giue him blowes,
1417   And take his bottle from him: When that's gone,
1418  *He shall drinke nought but brine, for Ile not shew him
1419   Where the quicke Freshes are.
1420   <S {Ste}.> {Trinculo}, run into no further danger:
1421  *Interrupt the Monster one word further, and by this
1422  *hand, Ile turne my mercie out o' doores, and make a
1423   Stockfish of thee.
1424   <S {Trin}.> Why, what did I? I did nothing:
1425   Ile go farther off.
1426   <S {Ste}.> Didst thou not say he lyed?
1427   <S {Ariell}.> Thou liest.
1428   <S {Ste}.> Do I so? Take thou that,
1429   As you like this, giue me the lye another time.
1430  *<S {Trin}.> I did not giue the lie: Out o'your wittes, and
1431   hearing too?
1432  *A pox o'your bottle, this can Sacke and drinking doo:
1433  *A murren on your Monster, and the diuell take your
1434   fingers.
1435   <S {Cal}.> Ha, ha, ha.
1436  *<S {Ste}.> Now forward with your Tale: prethee stand
1437   further off.
1438   <S {Cal}.> Beate him enough: after a little time
1439   Ile beate him too.
1440   <S {Ste}.> Stand farther: Come proceede.
1441   <S {Cal}.> Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custome with him
1442  *I'th afternoone to sleepe: there thou maist braine him,
1443   Hauing first seiz'd his bookes: Or with a logge
1444   Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
1445   Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
1446   First to possesse his Bookes; for without them
1447   Hee's but a Sot, as I am; nor hath not
1448   One Spirit to command: they all do hate him
1449   As rootedly as I. Burne but his Bookes,
1450   He ha's braue Vtensils (for so he calles them)
1451   Which when he ha's a house, hee'l decke withall.
1452   And that most deeply to consider, is
1453   The beautie of his daughter: he himselfe
1454   Cals her a non- pareill: I neuer saw a woman
1455   But onely {Sycorax} my Dam, and she;
1456   But she as farre surpasseth {Sycorax},
1457   As great'st do's least.
1458   <S {Ste}.> Is it so braue a Lasse?
1459   <S {Cal}.> #I Lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,
1460   And bring thee forth braue brood.
1461  *<S {Ste}.> Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and
1462  *I will be King and Queene, saue our Graces: and {Trin-culo}
1463   and thy selfe shall be Vice-royes:
1464   Dost thou like the plot {Trinculo}?
1465   <S {Trin}.> Excellent.
1466   <S {Ste}.> Giue me thy hand, I am sorry I beate thee:
1467  *But while thou liu'st keepe a good tongue in thy head.
1468   <S {Cal}.> Within this halfe houre will he be asleepe,
1469   Wilt thou destroy him then?
1470   <S {Ste}.> #I on mine honour.
1471   <S {Ariell}.> This will I tell my Master.
1472   <S {Cal}.> Thou mak'st me merry: I am full of pleasure,
1473   Let vs be iocond. Will you troule the Catch
1474   You taught me but whileare?
1475   <S {Ste}.> At thy request Monster, I will do reason,
1476   Any reason: Come on {Trinculo}, let vs sing.
1477   <D {Sings}.>
1478   {Flout 'em, and cout 'em: and skowt 'em, and flout 'em},
1479   {Thought is free}.
1480   <S {Cal}.> That's not the tune.
1481   <D {Ariell plaies the tune on a Tabor and Pipe}.>
1482   <S {Ste}.> What is this same?
1483  *<S {Trin}.> This is the tune of our Catch, plaid by the pic-ture
1484   of No- body.
1485  *<S {Ste}.> If thou beest a man, shew thy selfe in thy likenes:
1486   If thou beest a diuell, take't as thou list.
1487   <S {Trin}.> O forgiue me my sinnes.
1488   <S {Ste}.> He that dies payes all debts: I defie thee;
1489   Mercy vpon vs.
1490   <S {Cal}.> Art thou affeard?
1491   <S {Ste}.> No Monster, not I.
1492   <S {Cal}.> Be not affeard, the Isle is full of noyses,
1493  *Sounds, and sweet aires, that giue delight and hurt not:
1494   Sometimes a thousand twangling Instruments
1495   Will hum about mine eares; and sometime voices,
1496   That if I then had wak'd after long sleepe,
1497   Will make me sleepe againe, and then in dreaming,
1498   The clouds methought would open, and shew riches
1499   Ready to drop vpon me, that when I wak'd
1500   I cri'de to dreame againe.
1501   <S {Ste}.> This will proue a braue kingdome to me,
1502   Where I shall haue my Musicke for nothing.
1503   <S {Cal}.> When {Prospero} is destroy'd.
1504   <S {Ste}.> That shall be #by and by:
1505   I remember the storie.
1506   <S {Trin}.> The sound is going away,
1507   Lets follow it, and after do our worke.
1508   <S {Ste}.> Leade Monster,
1509   Wee'l follow: I would I could see this Taborer,
1510   He layes it on.
1511   <S {Trin}.> Wilt come?
1512   Ile follow {Stephano}.  <D {Exeunt}.>

1516   <S {Gon}.> By'r lakin, I can goe no further, Sir,
1517   My old bones akes: here's a maze trod indeede
1518  *Through fourth- rights, & Meanders: by your patience,
1519   I needes must rest me.
1520   <S {Al}.> Old Lord, I cannot blame thee,
1521   Who, am my selfe attach'd with wearinesse
1522   To th' dulling of my spirits: Sit downe, and rest:
1523   Euen here I will put off my hope, and keepe it
1524   No longer for my Flatterer: he is droun'd
1525   Whom thus we stray to finde, and the Sea mocks
1526   Our frustrate search on land: well, let him goe.
1527   <S {Ant}.> I am right glad, that he's so out of hope:
1528   Doe not for one repulse forgoe the purpose
1529   That you resolu'd t' effect.
1530   <S {Seb}.> The next aduantage will we take throughly.
1531   <S {Ant}.> Let it be to night,
1532   For now they are oppress'd with trauaile, they
1533   Will not, nor cannot vse such vigilance
1534   As when they are fresh.
1535  *<D {Solemne and strange Musicke: and Prosper on the top (inui-sible:})

1538   {inuiting the King, &c.  to eate, they depart}.>
1539   <S {Seb}.> I say to night: no more.
1540  *<S {Al}.> What harmony is this? my good friends, harke.
1541   <S {Gon}.> Maruellous sweet Musicke.
1542  *<S {Alo}.> Giue vs kind keepers, heaue[n]s: what were these?
1543   <S {Seb}.> A liuing {Drolerie}: now I will beleeue
1544   That there are Vnicornes: that in {Arabia}
1545   There is one Tree, the Phoenix throne, one Phoenix
1546   At this houre reigning there.
1547   <S {Ant}.> Ile beleeue both:
1548   And what do's else want credit, come to me
1549   And Ile besworne 'tis true: Trauellers nere did lye,
1550   Though fooles at home condemne 'em.
1551   <S {Gon}.> If in {Naples}
1552   I should report this now, would they beleeue me?
1553   If I should say I saw such Islands;
1554   (For certes, these are people of the Island)
1555   Who though they are of monstrous shape, yet note
1556   Their manners are more gentle, kinde, then of
1557   Our humaine generation you shall finde
1558   Many, nay almost any.
1559   <S {Pro}.> Honest Lord,
1560   Thou hast said well: for some of you there present;
1561   Are worse then diuels.
1562   <S {Al}.> I cannot too much muse
1563   Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound expressing
1564   (Although they want the vse of tongue) a kinde
1565   Of excellent dumbe discourse.
1566   <S {Pro}.> Praise in departing.
1567   <S {Fr}.> They vanish'd strangely.
1568   <S {Seb}.> No matter, since
1569  *They haue left their Viands behinde; for wee haue sto-|(macks.
1570   #Wilt please you taste of what is here?
1571   <S {Alo}.> Not I.
1572  *<S {Gon}.> Faith Sir, you neede not feare: when wee were |(Boyes
1573   Who would beleeue that there were Mountayneeres,
1574   Dew- lapt, like Buls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
1575   Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
1576  *Whose heads stood in their brests? which now we finde
1577   Each putter out of fiue for one, will bring vs
1578   Good warrant of.
1579   <S {Al}.> I will stand to, and feede,
1580   Although my last, no matter, since I feele
1581   The best is past: brother: my Lord, the Duke,
1582   Stand #too, and doe as we.
1583  *<D {Thunder and Lightning. Enter Ariell (like a Harpey) claps}
1584   {his wings vpon the Table, and with a quient deuice the}

1586   <S {Ar}.> You are three men of sinne, whom destiny
1587   That hath to instrument this lower world,
1588   And what is in't: the neuer surfeited Sea,
1589   Hath caus'd to belch vp you: and on this Island,
1590   Where man doth not inhabit, you 'mongst men,
1591   Being most vnfit to liue: I haue made you mad;
1592   And euen with such like valour, men hang, and drowne
1593   Their proper selues: you fooles, I and my fellowes
1594   Are ministers of Fate, the Elements
1595   Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
1596   Wound the loud windes, or with bemockt- at- Stabs
1597   Kill the still closing waters, as diminish
1598   One dowle that's in my plumbe: My fellow ministers
1599   Are like- invulnerable: if you could hurt,
1600   Your swords are now too massie for your strengths,
1601   And will not be vplifted: But remember
1602   (For that's my businesse to you) that you three
1603   From {Millaine} did supplant good {Prospero},
1604   Expos'd vnto the Sea (which hath requit it)
1605   Him, and his innocent childe: for which foule deed,
1606   The Powres, delaying (not forgetting) haue
1607   Incens'd the Seas, and Shores; yea, all the Creatures
1608   Against your peace: Thee of thy Sonne, {Alonso}
1609   They haue bereft; and doe pronounce by me
1610   Lingring perdition (worse then any death
1611   Can be at once) shall step, by step attend
1612  *You, and your wayes, whose wraths to guard you from,
1613   Which here, in this most desolate Isle, else fals
1614   Vpon your heads, is nothing but hearts- sorrow,
1615   And a cleere life ensuing.
1616  *<D {He vanishes in Thunder: then (to soft Musicke.) Enter the}
1617  *{shapes againe, and daunce (with mockes and mowes) and}
1618   {carrying out the Table}.>
1619   <S {Pro}.> Brauely the figure of this {Harpie}, hast thou
1620   Perform'd (my {Ariell}) a grace it had deuouring:
1621   Of my Instruction, hast thou nothing bated
1622   In what thou had'st to say: so with good life,
1623   And obseruation strange, my meaner ministers
1624  *Their seuerall kindes haue done: my high charmes work,
1625   And these (mine enemies) are all knit vp
1626   In their distractions: they now are in my powre;
1627   And in these fits, I leaue them, while I visit
1628   Yong {Ferdinand} (whom they suppose is droun'd)
1629   And his, and mine lou'd darling.
1630  *<S {Gon}.> I'th name of something holy, Sir, why stand you
1631   In this strange stare?
1632   <S {Al}.> O, it is monstrous: monstrous:
1633   Me thought the billowes spoke, and told me of it,
1634   The windes did sing it to me: and the Thunder
1635   (That deepe and dreadfull Organ- Pipe) pronounc'd
1636   The name of {Prosper}: it did base my Trespasse,
1637   Therefore my Sonne i'th Ooze is bedded; and
1638   I'le seeke him deeper then ere plummet sounded,
1639   And with him there lye mudded.  <D {Exit}.>
1640   <S {Seb}.> But one feend at a time,
1641   Ile fight their Legions ore.
      <P B1v>
1642   <S {Ant}.> Ile be thy Second.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1643  *<S {Gon}.> All three of them are desperate: their great guilt
1644   (Like poyson giuen to worke a great time after)
1645   Now gins to bite the spirits: I doe beseech you
1646   (That are of suppler ioynts) follow them swiftly,
1647   And hinder them from what this extasie
1648   May now prouoke them to.
1649   <S {Ad}.> Follow, I pray you.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
1650   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
1651   <D {Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda}.>
1652   <S {Pro}.> If I haue too austerely punish'd you,
1653   Your compensation makes amends, for I
1654   Haue giuen you here, a third of mine owne life,
1655   Or that for which I liue: who, once againe
1656   I tender to thy hand: All thy vexations
1657   Were but my trials of thy loue, and thou
1658   Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore heauen
1659   I ratifie this my rich guift: O {Ferdinand},
1660   Doe not smile at me, that I boast her of,
1661   For thou shalt finde she will out- strip all praise
1662   And make it halt, behinde her.
1663   <S {Fer}.> I doe beleeue it
1664   Against an Oracle.
1665   <S {Pro}.> Then, as my guest, and thine owne acquisition
1666   Worthily purchas'd, take my daughter: But
1667   If thou do'st breake her Virgin- knot, before
1668   All sanctimonious ceremonies may
1669   With full and holy right, be ministred,
1670   No sweet aspersion shall the heauens let fall
1671   To make this contract grow; but barraine hate,
1672   Sower- ey'd disdaine, and discord shall bestrew
1673   The vnion of your bed, with weedes so loathly
1674   That you shall hate it both: Therefore take heede,
1675   As Hymens Lamps shall light you.
1676   <S {Fer}.> As I hope
1677   For quiet dayes, faire Issue, and long life,
1678   With such loue, as 'tis now the murkiest den,
1679   The most opportune place, the strongst suggestion,
1680   Our worser {Genius} can, shall neuer melt
1681   Mine honor into lust, to take away
1682   The edge of that dayes celebration,
1683   When I shall thinke, or {Phoebus} Steeds are founderd,
1684   Or Night kept chain'd below.
1685   <S {Pro}.> Fairely spoke;
1686   Sit then, and talke with her, she is thine owne;
1687  *What {Ariell}; my industrious serua[n]t {Ariell}.  <D {Enter Ariell}.>
1688   <S {Ar}.> What would my potent master? here I am.
1689  *<S {Pro}.> Thou, and thy meaner fellowes, your last seruice
1690   Did worthily performe: and I must vse you
1691   In such another tricke: goe bring the rabble
1692   (Ore whom I giue thee powre) here, to this place:
1693   Incite them to quicke motion, for I must
1694   Bestow vpon the eyes of this yong couple
1695   Some vanity of mine #Art: it is my promise,
1696   And they expect it from me.
1697   <S {Ar}.> Presently?
1698   <S {Pro}.> #I: with a twincke.
1699   <S {Ar}.> Before you can say come, and goe,
1700   And breathe twice; and cry, so, so:
1701   Each one tripping on his Toe,
1702   Will be here with mop, and mowe.
1703   Doe you loue me Master? no?
1704   <S {Pro}.> Dearely, my delicate {Ariell}: doe not approach
1705   Till thou do'st heare me call.
1706   <S {Ar}.> Well: I conceiue. <D {Exit}.>
1707   <S {Pro}.> Looke thou be true: doe not giue dalliance
1708   Too much the raigne: the strongest oathes, are straw
1709   To th' fire ith' blood: be more abstenious,
1710   Or else good night your vow.
1711   <S {Fer}.> I warrant you, Sir,
1712   The white cold virgin Snow, vpon my heart
1713   Abates the ardour of my Liuer.
1714   <S {Pro}.> Well.
1715   Now come my {Ariell}, bring a Corolary,
1716  *Rather then want a Spirit; appear, & pertly. <D {Soft musick}.>
1717   No tongue: all eyes: be silent.  <D {Enter Iris}.>
1718   <S {Ir}.> {Ceres}, most bounteous Lady, thy rich Leas
1719   Of Wheate, Rye, Barley, Fetches, Oates and Pease;
1720   Thy Turphie- Mountaines, where liue nibling Sheepe,
1721   And flat Medes thetchd with Stouer, them to keepe:
1722   Thy bankes with pioned, and twilled brims
1723   Which spungie {Aprill}, at thy hest betrims;
1724  *To make cold Nymphes chast crownes; & thy broome-|(#groues;
1725   Whose shadow the dismissed Batchelor loues,
1726   Being lasse- lorne: thy pole- clipt vineyard,
1727   And thy Sea- marge stirrile, and rockey- hard,
1728   Where thou thy selfe do'st ayre, the Queene o'th Skie,
1729   Whose watry Arch, and messenger, am I.
1730  *Bids thee leaue these, & with her soueraigne grace, <D {Iuno | descends}.>
1731   Here on this grasse- plot, in this very place
1732   To come, and sport: here Peacocks flye amaine:
1733   Approach, rich {Ceres}, her to entertaine.  <D {Enter Ceres}.>
1734   <S {Cer}.> Haile, many- coloured Messenger, that nere
1735   Do'st disobey the wife of {Iupiter}:
1736   Who, with thy saffron wings, vpon my flowres
1737   Diffusest hony drops, refreshing showres,
1738   And with each end of thy blew bowe do'st crowne
1739   My boskie acres, and my vnshrubd downe,
1740   Rich scarph to my proud earth: why hath thy Queene
1741   Summond me hither, to this short gras'd Greene?
1742   <S {Ir}.> A contract of true Loue, to celebrate,
1743   And some donation freely to estate
1744   On the bles'd Louers.
1745   <S {Cer}.> Tell me heauenly Bowe,
1746   If {Venus} or her Sonne, as thou do'st know,
1747   Doe now attend the Queene? since they did plot
1748   The meanes, that duskie {Dis}, my daughter got,
1749   Her, and her blind- Boyes scandald company,
1750   I haue forsworne.
1751   <S {Ir}.> Of her societie
1752   Be not afraid: I met her deitie
1753   Cutting the clouds towards {Paphos}: and her Son
1754  *Doue- drawn with her: here thought they to haue done
1755   Some wanton charme, vpon this Man and Maide,
1756   Whose vowes are, that no bed- right shall be paid
1757   Till {Hymens} Torch be lighted: but in vaine,
1758   {Marses} hot Minion is returnd againe,
1759   Her waspish headed sonne, has broke his arrowes,
1760  *Swears he will shoote no more, but play with Sparrows,
1761   And be a Boy right out.
1762   <S {Cer}.> Highest Queene of State,
1763   Great {Iuno} comes, I know her by her gate
1764   <S {Iu}.> How do's my bounteous sister? goe with me

1766   And honourd in their Issue. <D {They sing}.>

1779   <S {Fer}.> This is a most maiesticke vision, and
1780   Harmonious charmingly: may I be bold
1781   To thinke these spirits?
1782   <S {Pro}.> Spirits, which by mine #Art
1783   I haue from their confines call'd to enact
1784   My present fancies.

1786   So rare a wondred Father, and a wise
1787   Makes this place Paradise.
1788   <S {Pro}.> Sweet now, silence:
1789   {Iuno} and {Ceres} whisper seriously,
1790   There's something else to doe: hush, and be mute
1791   Or else our spell is mar'd.
1792  *<D Iuno {and} Ceres {whisper, and send} Iris {on employment}.>

1795   Leaue your crispe channels, and on this green- Land
1796   Answere your summons, {Iuno} do's command.
1797   Come temperate {Nimphes}, and helpe to celebrate
1798   A Contract of true Loue: be not too late.
1799   <D {Enter Certaine Nimphes}.>
1800   You Sun- burn'd Sicklemen of August weary,
1801   Come hether from the furrow, and be merry,
1802   Make holly day: your Rye- straw hats put on,
1803   And these fresh Nimphes encounter euery one
1804   In Country footing.
1805  *<D {Enter certaine Reapers (properly habited:) they ioyne with}

1807  *Prospero {starts sodainly and speakes, after which to a}
1808   {strange hollow and confused noyse, they heauily vanish}.>
1809   <S {Pro}.> I had forgot that foule conspiracy
1810   Of the beast {Calliban}, and his confederates
1811   Against my life: the minute of their plot
1812   Is almost come: Well done, auoid: no more.
1813   <S {Fer}.> This is strange: your fathers in some passion
1814   That workes him strongly.
1815   <S {Mir}.> Neuer till this day
1816   Saw I him touch'd with anger, so distemper'd.
1817   <S {Pro}.> You doe looke (my son) in a mou'd sort,
1818   As if you were dismaid: be cheerefull Sir,
1819   Our Reuels now are ended: These our actors,
1820   (As I foretold you) were all Spirits, and
1821   Are melted into Ayre, into thin Ayre,
1822   And like the baselesse fabricke of this vision
1823   The Clowd- capt Towres, the gorgeous Pallaces,
1824   The solemne Temples, the great Globe it selfe,
1825   Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolue,
1826   And like this insubstantiall Pageant faded
1827   Leaue not a racke behinde: we are such stuffe
1828   As dreames are made on; and our little life
1829   Is rounded with a sleepe: Sir, I am vext,
1830   Beare with my weakenesse, my old braine is troubled:
1831   Be not disturb'd with my infirmitie,
1832   If you be pleas'd, retire into my Cell,
1833   And there repose, a turne or two, Ile walke
1834   To still my beating minde.
1835   <S {Fer}. {Mir}.> We wish your peace.  <D {Exit}.>
1836  *<S {Pro}.> Come with a thought; I thank thee {Ariell}: come.
1837   <D {Enter Ariell}.>
1838  *<S {Ar}.> Thy thoughts I cleaue to, what's thy pleasure?
1839  *<S {Pro}.> Spirit: We must prepare to meet with {Caliban}.
1840   <S {Ar}.> #I my Commander, when I presented {Ceres}
1841   I thought to haue told thee of it, but I fear'd
1842   Least I might anger thee.
1843  *<S {Pro}.> Say again, where didst thou leaue these varlots?
1844  *<S {Ar}.> I told you Sir, they were red- hot with drinking,
1845   So full of valour, that they smote the ayre
1846   For breathing in their faces: beate the ground
1847   For kissing of their feete; yet alwaies bending
1848   Towards their proiect: then I beate my Tabor,
1849   At which like vnback't colts they prickt their eares,
1850   Aduanc'd their eye- lids, lifted vp their noses
1851   As they smelt musicke, so I charm'd their eares
1852   That Calfe- like, they my lowing follow'd, through
1853   Tooth'd briars, sharpe firzes, pricking gosse, & thorns,
1854   Which entred their fraile shins: at last I left them
1855   I'th' filthy mantled poole beyond your Cell,
1856   There dancing vp to th' chins, that the fowle Lake
1857   Ore- stunck their feet.
1858   <S {Pro}.> This was well done (my bird)
1859   Thy shape inuisible retaine thou still:
1860   The trumpery in my house, goe bring it hither
1861   For stale to catch these theeues. <S {Ar}.> I go, I goe.  <D {Exit}.>
1862   <S {Pro}.> A Deuill, a borne- Deuill, on whose nature
1863   Nurture can neuer sticke: on whom my paines
1864   Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost,
1865   And, as with age, his body ouglier growes,
1866   So his minde cankers: I will plague them all,
1867   Euen to roaring: Come, hang on them this line.
1868  *<D {Enter} Ariell, {loaden with glistering apparell, &c.  Enter}
1869   Caliban, Stephano, {and} Trinculo, {all wet}.>
1870  *<S {Cal}.> Pray you tread softly, that the blinde Mole may
1871   not heare a foot fall: we now are neere his Cell.
1872  *<S {St}.> Monster, your Fairy, w you say is a harmles Fairy,
1873   Has done little better then plaid the Iacke with vs.
1874   <S {Trin}.> Monster, I do smell all horse- pisse, at which
1875   My nose is in great indignation.
1876  *<S {Ste}.> So is mine. Do you heare Monster: If I should
1877   Take a displeasure against you: Looke you.
1878   <S {Trin}.> Thou wert but a lost Monster.
1879   <S {Cal}.> Good my Lord, giue me thy fauour stil,
1880   Be patient, for the prize Ile bring thee #too
1881  *Shall hudwinke this mischance: therefore speake softly,
1882   All's husht as midnight yet.
1883   <S {Trin}.> #I, but to loose our bottles in the Poole.
1884  *<S {Ste}.> There is not onely disgrace and dishonor in that
1885   Monster, but an infinite losse.
1886   <S {Tr}.> That's more to me then my wetting:
1887   Yet this is your harmlesse Fairy, Monster.
1888   <S {Ste}.> I will fetch off my bottle,
1889   Though I be o're eares for my labour.
1890   <S {Cal}.> Pre- thee (my King) be quiet. Seest thou heere
1891   This is the mouth o'th Cell: no noise, and enter:
1892   Do that good mischeefe, which may make this Island
1893   Thine owne for euer, and I thy {Caliban}
1894   For aye thy foot- licker.
1895   <S {Ste}.> Giue me thy hand,
1896   I do begin to haue bloody thoughts.
1897  *<S {Trin}.> O King {Stephano}, O Peere: O worthy {Stephano},
1898   Looke what a wardrobe heere is for thee.
1899   <S {Cal}.> Let it alone thou foole, it is but trash.
1900  *<S {Tri}.> Oh, ho, Monster: wee know what belongs to a
1901   frippery, O King {Stephano}.
      <P B2v>
1902  *<S {Ste}.> Put off that gowne ({Trinculo}) by this hand Ile
1903   haue that gowne.
1904   <S {Tri}.> Thy grace shall haue it.
1905  *<S {Cal}.> The dropsie drowne this foole, what doe you |(meane
1906   To doate thus on such luggage? let's alone
1907   And doe the murther first: if he awake,
1908   From toe to crowne hee'l fill our skins with pinches,
1909   Make vs strange stuffe.
1910  *<S {Ste}.> Be you quiet (Monster) Mistris line, is not this
1911  *my Ierkin? how is the Ierkin vnder the line: now Ier-kin
1912  *you are like to lose your haire, & proue a bald Ierkin.
1913  *<S {Trin}.> Doe, doe; we steale by lyne and leuell, and't
1914   like your grace.
1915  *<S {Ste}.> I thank thee for that iest; heer's a garment for't:
1916  *Wit shall not goe vn- rewarded while I am King of this
1917  *Country: Steale by line and leuell, is an excellent passe
1918   of pate: there's another garment for't.
1919  *<S {Tri}.> Monster, come put some Lime vpon your fin-gers,
1920   and away with the rest.
1921   <S {Cal}.> I will haue none on't: we shall loose our time,
1922   And all be turn'd to Barnacles, or to Apes
1923   With foreheads villanous low.
1924  *<S {Ste}.> Monster, lay to your fingers: helpe to beare this
1925  *away, where my hogshead of wine is, or Ile turne you
1926   out of my kingdome: goe to, carry this.
1927   <S {Tri}.> And this.

1934   <S {Pro}.> Fury, Fury: there Tyrant, there: harke, harke.
1935   Goe, charge my Goblins that they grinde their ioynts
1936   With dry Convultions, shorten vp their sinewes
1937  *With aged Cramps, & more pinch- spotted make them,
1938   Then Pard, or Cat o' Mountaine.
1939   <S {Ari}.> Harke, they rore.
1940   <S {Pro}.> Let them be hunted soundly: At this houre
1941   Lies at my mercy all mine enemies:
1942   Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
1943   Shalt haue the ayre at freedome: for a little
1944   Follow, and doe me seruice.  <D {Exeunt}.>

1947   <S {Pro}.> Now do's my Proiect gather to a head:
1948   My charmes cracke not: my Spirits obey, and Time
1949   Goes vpright with his carriage: how's the day?
1950   <S {Ar}.> On the sixt hower, at which time, my Lord
1951   You said our worke should cease.
1952   <S {Pro}.> I did say so,
1953   When first I rais'd the Tempest: say my Spirit,
1954   How fares the King, and's followers?
1955   <S {Ar}.> Confin'd together
1956   In the same fashion, as you gaue in charge,
1957   Iust as you left them; all prisoners Sir
1958   In the {Line- groue} which weather- fends your Cell,
1959   They cannot boudge till your release: The King,
1960   His Brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
1961   And the remainder mourning ouer them,
1962   Brim full of sorrow, and dismay: but chiefly
1963   Him that you term'd Sir, the good old Lord {Gonzallo},
1964   His teares runs downe his beard like winters drops
1965  *From eaues of reeds: your charm so strongly works 'em
1966   That if you now beheld them, your affections
1967   Would become tender.
1968   <S {Pro}.> Dost thou thinke so, Spirit?
1969   <S {Ar}.> Mine would, Sir, were I humane.
1970   <S {Pro}.> And mine shall.
1971   Hast thou (which art but aire) a touch, a feeling
1972   Of their afflictions, and shall not my selfe,
1973   One of their kinde, that rellish all as sharpely,
1974   Passion as they, be kindlier mou'd then thou art?
1975  *Thogh with their high wrongs I am strook to th' quick,
1976   Yet, with my nobler reason, gainst my furie
1977   Doe I take part: the rarer Action is
1978   In vertue, then in vengeance: they, being penitent,
1979   The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
1980   Not a frowne further: Goe, release them {Ariell},
1981   My Charmes Ile breake, their sences Ile restore,
1982   And they shall be themselues.
1983   <S {Ar}.> Ile fetch them, Sir.  <D {Exit}.>
1984  *<S {Pro}.> Ye Elues of hils, brooks, sta[n]ding lakes & groues,

1986   Doe chase the ebbing-{#Neptune}, and doe flie him
1987   When he comes backe: you demy- Puppets, that

2004   To worke mine end vpon their Sences, that
2005   This Ayrie- charme is for, I'le breake my staffe,

2018   Holy {Gonzallo}, Honourable man,
2019   Mine eyes ev'n sociable to the shew of thine
2020   Fall fellowly drops: The charme dissolues apace,
2021   And as the morning steales vpon the night
2022   (Melting the darkenesse) so their rising sences
2023   Begin to chace the ignorant fumes that mantle
2024   Their cleerer reason. O good {Gonzallo}
2025   My true preseruer, and a loyall #Sir,
2026   To him thou follow'st; I will pay thy graces
2027   Home both in word, and deede: Most cruelly
      <P B3>
2028   Did thou {Alonso}, vse me, and my daughter:
2029   Thy brother was a furtherer in the Act,
2030   Thou art pinch'd for't now {Sebastian}. Flesh, and bloud,
2031   You, brother mine, that entertaine ambition,
2032   Expelld remorse, and nature, whom, with {Sebastian}
2033   (Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong)
2034  *Would heere haue kill'd your King: I do forgiue thee,
2035   Vnnaturall though thou art: Their vnderstanding
2036   Begins to swell, and the approching tide
2037   Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
2038   That now ly foule, and muddy: not one of them
2039   That yet lookes on me, or would know me: {Ariell},
2040   Fetch me the Hat, and Rapier in my Cell,
2041   I will discase me, and my selfe present
2042   As I was sometime  {Millaine}: quickly Spirit,
2043   Thou shalt ere long be free.

2055   There shalt thou finde the Marriners asleepe
2056   Vnder the Hatches: the Master and the Boat- swaine
2057   Being awake, enforce them to this place;
2058   And presently, I pre'thee.

2061  *<S {Gon}.> All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement
2062   Inhabits heere: some heauenly power guide vs
2063   Out of this fearefull Country.
2064   <S {Pro}.> Behold Sir King
2065   The wronged Duke of {Millaine}, {Prospero}:
2066   For more assurance that a liuing Prince
2067   Do's now speake to thee, I embrace thy body,
2068   And to thee, and thy Company, I bid
2069   A hearty welcome.
2070   <S {Alo}.> Where thou bee'st he or no,
2071   Or some inchanted triflle to abuse me,
2072   (As late I haue beene) I not know: thy Pulse
2073   Beats as of flesh, and blood: and since I saw thee,
2074   Th' affliction of my minde amends, with which
2075   I feare a madnesse held me: this must craue
2076   (#And if this be at all) a most strange story.
2077   Thy Dukedome I resigne, and doe entreat
2078   Thou pardon me my wrongs: But how shold {Prospero}
2079   Be liuing, and be heere?
2080   <S {Pro}.> First, noble Frend,
2081   Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot
2082   Be measur'd, or confin'd.
2083   <S {Gonz}.> Whether this be,
2084   Or be not, I'le not sweare.
2085   <S {Pro}.> You doe yet taste
2086   Some subtleties o'th' Isle, that will nor let you
2087   Beleeue things certaine: Wellcome, my friends all,
2088   But you, my brace of Lords, were I so minded
2089   I heere could plucke his Highnesse frowne vpon you
2090   And iustifie you Traitors: at this time
2091   I will tell no tales.
2092   <S {Seb}.> The Diuell speakes in him:
2093   <S {Pro}.> No:
2094   For you (most wicked Sir) whom to call brother
2095   Would euen infect my mouth, I do forgiue
2096   Thy rankest fault; all of them: and require
2097   My Dukedome of thee, which, perforce I know
2098   Thou must restore.
2099   <S {Alo}.> If thou beest {Prospero}
2100   Giue vs particulars of thy preseruation,
2101  *How thou hast met vs heere, whom three howres since
2102   Were wrackt vpon this shore? where I haue lost
2103   (How sharp the point of this remembrance is)
2104   My deere sonne {Ferdinand}.
2105   <S {Pro}.> I am woe for't, Sir.
2106   <S {Alo}.> Irreparable is the losse, and patience
2107   Saies, it is past her cure.
2108   <S {Pro}.> I rather thinke
2109   You haue not sought her helpe, of whose soft grace
2110   For the like losse, I haue her soueraigne aid,
2111   And rest my selfe content.
2112   <S {Alo}.> You the like losse?
2113   <S {Pro}.> As great to me, as late, and supportable
2114   To make the deere losse, haue I meanes much weaker
2115   Then you may call to comfort you; for I
2116   Haue lost my daughter.
2117   <S {Alo}.> A daughter?
2118   Oh heauens, that they were liuing both in {Naples}
2119   The King and Queene there, that they were, I wish
2120   My selfe were mudded in that oo-zie bed
2121  *Where my sonne lies: when did you lose your daughter?
2122   <S {Pro}.> In this last Tempest. I perceiue these Lords
2123   At this encounter doe so much admire,
2124   That they deuoure their reason, and scarce thinke
2125   Their eies doe offices of Truth: Their words
2126   Are naturall breath: but howsoeu'r you haue
2127   Beene iustled from your sences, know for certain
2128   That I am {Prospero}, and that very Duke
2129  *Which was thrust forth of {Millaine}, who most strangely
2130   Vpon this shore (where you were wrackt) was landed
2131   To be the Lord on't: No more yet of this,
2132   For 'tis a Chronicle of day by day,
2133   Not a relation for a break- fast, nor
2134   Befitting this first meeting: Welcome, Sir;
2135   This Cell's my Court: heere haue I few attendants,
2136   And Subiects none abroad: pray you looke in:
2137   My Dukedome since you haue giuen me againe,
2138   I will requite you with as good a thing,
2139   At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
2140   As much, as me my Dukedome.
2141  *<D {Here Prospero discouers Ferdinand and Miranda, play-ing}
2142   {at Chesse}.>
2143   <S {Mir}.> Sweet Lord, you play me false.
2144   <S {Fer}.> No my dearest loue,
2145   I would not for the world.
2146  *<S {Mir}.> Yes, for a score of Kingdomes, you should |(wrangle,
2147   And I would call it faire play.
2148   <S {Alo}.> If this proue
2149   A vision of the Island, one deere Sonne
2150   Shall I twice loose.
2151   <S {Seb}.> A most high miracle.
2152   <S {Fer}.> Though the Seas threaten they are mercifull,
2153   I haue curs'd them without cause.
2154   <S {Alo}.> Now all the blessings
2155   Of a glad father, compasse thee about:
2156   Arise, and say how thou cam'st heere.
2157   <S {Mir}.> O wonder!
2158   How many goodly creatures are there heere?
2159   How beauteous mankinde is? O braue new world
      <P B3v><C D>
2160   That has such people in't.
2161   <S {Pro}.> 'Tis new to thee.
2162  *<S {Alo}.> What is this Maid, with whom thou was't at |(play?
2163   Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three houres:
2164   Is she the goddesse that hath seuer'd vs,
2165   And brought vs thus together?
2166   <S {Fer}.> Sir, she is mortall;
2167   But by immortall prouidence, she's mine;
2168   I chose her when I could not aske my Father
2169   For his aduise: nor thought I had one: She
2170   Is daughter to this famous Duke of {Millaine},
2171   Of whom, so often I haue heard renowne,
2172   But neuer saw before: of whom I haue
2173   Receiu'd a second life; and second Father
2174   This Lady makes him to me.
2175   <S {Alo}.> I am hers.
2176   But O, how odly will it sound, that I
2177   Must aske my childe forgiuenesse?
2178   <S {Pro}.> There Sir stop,
2179   Let vs not burthen our remembrances, with
2180   A heauinesse that's gon.
2181   <S {Gon}.> I haue inly wept,
2182   Or should haue spoke ere this: looke downe you gods
2183   And on this couple drop a blessed crowne;
2184   For it is you, that haue chalk'd forth the way
2185   Which brought vs hither.
2186   <S {Alo}.> I say Amen, {Gonzallo}.
2187  *<S {Gon}.> Was {Millaine} thrust from {Millaine}, that his Issue
2188   Should become Kings of {Naples}? O reioyce
2189   Beyond a common ioy, and set it downe
2190   With gold on lasting Pillers: In one voyage
2191   Did {Claribell} her husband finde at {Tunis},
2192   And {Ferdinand} her brother, found a wife,
2193   Where he himselfe was lost: {Prospero}, his Dukedome
2194   In a poore Isle: and all of vs, our selues,
2195   When no man was his owne.
2196   <S {Alo}.> Giue me your hands:
2197   Let griefe and sorrow still embrace his heart,
2198   That doth not wish you ioy.
2199   <S {Gon}.> Be it so, Amen.
2200   <D {Enter Ariell, with the Master and Boatswaine}
2201   {amazedly following}.>
2202   O looke Sir, looke Sir, here is more of vs:
2203   I prophesi'd, if a Gallowes were on Land
2204   This fellow could not drowne: Now blasphemy,
2205   That swear'st Grace ore- boord, not an oath on shore,
2206   Hast thou no mouth by land?
2207   What is the newes?
2208   <S {Bot}.> The best newes is, that we haue safely found
2209   Our King, and company: The next: our Ship,
2210   Which but three glasses since, we gaue out split,
2211   Is tyte, and #yare, and brauely rig'd, as when
2212   We first put out to Sea.
2213   <S {Ar}.> Sir, all this seruice
2214   Haue I done since I went.
2215   <S {Pro}.> My tricksey Spirit.
2216   <S {Alo}.> These are not naturall euents, they strengthen
2217   From strange, to stranger: say, how came you hither?
2218   <S {Bot}.> If I did thinke, Sir, I were well awake,
2219   I'ld striue to tell you: we were dead of sleepe,
2220   And (how we know not) all clapt vnder hatches,
2221   Where, but euen now, with strange, and seuerall noyses
2222   Of roring, shreeking, howling, gingling chaines,
2223   And mo diuersitie of sounds, all horrible.
2224   We were awak'd: straight way, at liberty;
2225   Where we, in all our trim, freshly beheld
2226   Our royall, good, and gallant Ship: our Master
2227   Capring to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
2228   Euen in a dreame, were we diuided from them,
2229   And were brought moaping hither.
2230   <S {Ar}.> #Was't well done?
2231   <S {Pro}.> Brauely (my diligence) thou shalt be free.
2232   <S {Alo}.> This is as strange a Maze, as ere men trod,
2233   And there is in this businesse, more then nature
2234   Was euer conduct of: some Oracle
2235   Must rectifie our knowledge.
2236   <S {Pro}.> Sir, my Leige,
2237   Doe not infest your minde, with beating on
2238   The strangenesse of this businesse, at pickt leisure
2239   (Which shall be shortly single) I'le resolue you,
2240   (Which to you shall seeme probable) of euery
2241   These happend accidents: till when, be cheerefull
2242   And thinke of each thing well: Come hither Spirit,
2243   Set {Caliban}, and his companions free:
2244   Vntye the Spell: How fares my gracious Sir?
2245   There are yet missing of your Companie
2246   Some few odde Lads, that you remember not.
2247   <D {Enter Ariell, driuing in Caliban, Stephano, and}
2248   {Trinculo in their stolne Apparell}.>
2249   <S {Ste}.> Euery man shift for all the rest, and let
2250   No man take care for himselfe; for all is
2251   But fortune: {Coragio} Bully- Monster {Coragio}.
2252  *<S {Tri}.> If these be true spies which I weare in my head,
2253   here's a goodly sight.
2254   <S {Cal}.> O {Setebos}, these be braue Spirits indeede:
2255   How fine my Master is? I am afraid
2256   He will chastise me.
2257   <S {Seb}.> Ha, ha:
2258   What things are these, my Lord {Anthonio}?
2259   Will money buy em?
2260   <S {Ant}.> Very like: one of them
2261   Is a plaine Fish, and no doubt marketable.
2262   <S {Pro}.> Marke but the badges of these men, my Lords,
2263   Then say if they be true: This mishapen knaue;
2264   His Mother was a Witch, and one so strong
2265  *That could controle the Moone; make flowes, and ebs,
2266   And deale in her command, without her power:
2267   These three haue robd me, and this demy- diuell;
2268   (For he's a bastard one) had plotted with them
2269   To take my life: two of these Fellowes, you
2270   Must know, and owne, this Thing of darkenesse, I
2271   Acknowledge mine.
2272   <S {Cal}.> I shall be pincht to death.
2273   <S {Alo}.> Is not this {Stephano}, my drunken Butler?
2274   <S {Seb}.> He is drunke now;
2275   Where had he wine?
2276  *<S {Alo}.> And {Trinculo} is reeling ripe: where should they
2277   Finde this grand Liquor that hath gilded 'em?
2278   How cam'st thou in this pickle?
2279   <S {Tri}.> I haue bin in such a pickle since I saw you last,
2280   That I feare me will neuer out of my bones:
2281   I shall not feare fly- blowing.
2282   <S {Seb}.> Why how now {Stephano}?
2283  *<S {Ste}.> O touch me not, I am not {Stephano}, but a Cramp.
2284   <S {Pro}.> You'ld be King o'the Isle, Sirha?
2285   <S {Ste}.> I should haue bin a sore one then.
2286   <S {Alo}.> This is a strange thing as ere I look'd on.
2287   <S {Pro}.> He is as disproportion'd in his Manners
2288   As in his shape: Goe Sirha, to my Cell,
2289   Take with you your Companions: as you looke
2290   To haue my pardon, trim it handsomely.
2291   <S {Cal}.> #I that I will: and Ile be wise hereafter,
      <P B4><C C>
2292   And seeke for grace: what a thrice double Asse
2293   Was I to take this drunkard for a god?
2294   And worship this dull foole?
2295   <S {Pro}.> Goe to, away.
2296  *<S {Alo}.> Hence, and bestow your luggage where you |(found it.
2297   <S {Seb}.> Or stole it rather.
2298   <S {Pro}.> Sir, I inuite your Highnesse, and your traine
2299   To my poore Cell: where you shall take your rest
2300   For this one night, which part of it, Ile waste
2301   With such discourse, as I not doubt, shall make it
2302   Goe quicke away: The story of my life,
2303   And the particular accidents, gon by
2304   Since I came to this Isle: And in the morne
2305   I'le bring you to your ship, and so to {Naples},
2306   Where I haue hope to see the nuptiall
2307   Of these  our deere- belou'd, solemnized,
2308   And thence retire me to my {Millaine}, where
2309   Euery third thought shall be my graue.
2310   <S {Alo}.> I long
2311   To heare the story of your life; which must
2312   Take the eare strangely.
2313   <S {Pro}.> I'le deliuer all,
2314   And promise you calme Seas, auspicious gales,
2315   And saile, so expeditious, that shall catch
2316   Your Royall fleete farre off: My {Ariel}; chicke
2317   That is thy charge: Then to the Elements
2318   Be free, and fare thou well: please you draw neere.
