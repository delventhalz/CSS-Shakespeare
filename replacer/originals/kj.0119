2     *<D {Enter King Iohn, Queene Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, and Sa-lisbury},
3      {with the Chattylion of France}.>
4      <S {King} {Iohn}.>
5     *Now say {Chatillion}, what would {France} with vs?
6      <S {Chat}.> Thus (after greeting) speakes the King
7      of France,
8      In my behauiour to the Maiesty,
9      The borrowed Maiesty of {England} heere.
10     <S {Elea}.> A strange beginning: borrowed Maiesty?
11     <S {K.Iohn}.> Silence (good mother) heare the Embassie.
12     <S {Chat}.> {Philip} of {France}, in right and true behalfe
13     Of thy deceased brother, {Geffreyes} sonne,
14     {#Arthur Plantaginet}, laies most lawfull claime
15     To this faire Iland, and the Territories:
16     To {Ireland, Poyctiers, Aniowe, Torayne, Maine},
17     Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
18     Which swaies vsurpingly these seuerall titles,
19     And put the same into yong {Arthurs} hand,
20     Thy Nephew, and right royall Soueraigne.
21     <S {K.Iohn}.> What followes if we disallow of this?
22    *<S {Chat}.> The proud controle of fierce and bloudy warre,
23     To inforce these rights, so forcibly with- held,
24    *<S {K.Io}.> Heere haue we war for war, & bloud for bloud,
25     Controlement for controlement: so answer {France}.
26    *<S {Chat}.> Then take my Kings defiance from my mouth,
27     The farthest limit of my Embassie.
28     <S {K.Iohn}.> Beare mine to him, and so depart in peace,
29     Be thou as lightning in the eies of {France};
30     For ere thou canst report, I will be there:
31     The thunder of my Cannon shall be heard.
32     So hence: be thou the trumpet of our wrath,
33     And sullen presage of your owne decay:
34     An honourable conduct let him haue,
35     {Pembroke} looke too't: farewell {Chattillion}.
36     <D {Exit Chat. and Pem}.>
37     <S {Ele}.> What now my sonne, haue I not euer said
38     How that ambitious {Constance} would not cease
39     Till she had kindled {France} and all the world,
40     Vpon the right and party of her sonne.
41     This might haue beene preuented, and made whole
42     With very easie arguments of loue,
43     Which now the mannage of two kingdomes must
44     With fearefull bloudy issue arbitrate.
45     <S {K.Iohn}.> Our strong possession, and our right for vs.
46    *<S {Eli}.> Your strong possessio[n] much more then your right,
47     Or else it must go wrong with you and me,
48     So much my conscience whispers in your eare,
49     Which none but heauen, and you, and I, shall heare.
50     <D {Enter a Sheriffe}.>
51     <S {Essex}.> My Liege, here is the strangest controuersie
52     Come from the Country to be iudg'd by you
53     That ere I heard: shall I produce the men?
54     <S {K.Iohn}.> Let them approach:
55     Our Abbies and our Priories shall pay
56     This expeditions charge: what men are you?
57     <D {Enter Robert Faulconbridge, and Philip}.>
58     <S {Philip}.> Your faithfull subiect, I a gentleman,
59     Borne in {Northamptonshire}, and eldest sonne
60     As I suppose, to {Robert Faulconbridge},
61     A Souldier by the Honor- giuing- hand
62     Of {Cordelion}, Knighted in the field.
63     <S {K.Iohn}.> What art thou?
64    *<S {Robert}.> The son and heire to that same {Faulconbridge}.
65     <S {K.Iohn}.> Is that the elder, and art thou the heyre?
66     You came not of one mother then it seemes.
67     <S {Philip}.> Most certain of one mother, mighty King,
68     That is well knowne, and as I thinke one father:
69     But for the certaine knowledge of that truth,
70     I put you o're to heauen, and to my mother;
71     Of that I doubt, as all mens children may.
72    *<S {Eli}.> Out on thee rude man, y dost shame thy mother,
73     And wound her honor with this diffidence.
74     <S {Phil}.> I Madame? No, I haue no reason for it,
75     That is my brothers plea, and none of mine,
76     The which if he can proue, #a pops me out,
77     At least from faire fiue hundred pound a yeere:
78     Heauen guard my mothers honor, and my Land.
79    *<S {K.Iohn}.> A good blunt fellow: why being yonger born
80     Doth he lay claime to thine inheritance?
81     <S {Phil}.> I know not why, except to get the land:
82     But once he slanderd me with bastardy:
83     But #where I be as true begot or no,
84     That still I lay vpon my mothers head,
85     But that I am as well begot my Liege
86     (Faire fall the bones that tooke the paines for me)
87     Compare our faces, and be Iudge your selfe
88     If old Sir {Robert} did beget vs both,
89     And were our father, and this sonne like him:
90     O old sir {Robert} Father, on my knee
91     I giue heauen thankes I was not like to thee.
92    *<S {K.Iohn}.> Why what a mad- cap hath heauen lent vs here?
93     <S {Elen}.> He hath a tricke of {Cordelions} face,
94     The accent of his tongue affecteth him:
95     Doe you not read some tokens of my sonne
96     In the large composition of this man?
      <P a1v>
97     <S {K.Iohn}.> Mine eye hath well examined his parts,
98     And findes them perfect {Richard}: sirra speake,
99     What doth moue you to claime your brothers land.
100    <S {Philip}.> Because he hath a half- face like my father?
101    With halfe that face would he haue all my land,
102    A halfe- fac'd groat, fiue hundred pound a yeere?
103    <S {Rob}.> My gracious Liege, when that my father liu'd,
104    Your brother did imploy my father much.
105    <S {Phil}.> Well sir, by this you cannot get my land,
106    Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
107    <S {Rob}.> And once dispatch'd him in an Embassie
108    To {Germany}, there with the Emperor
109    To treat of high affaires touching that time:
110    Th' aduantage of his absence tooke the King,
111    And in the meane time soiourn'd at my fathers;
112    Where how he did preuaile, I shame to speake:
113    But truth is truth, large lengths of seas and shores
114    Betweene my father, and my mother lay,
115    As I haue heard my father speake himselfe
116    When this same lusty gentleman was got:
117    Vpon his death- bed he by #will bequeath'd
118    His lands to me, and tooke it on his death
119    That this my mothers sonne was none of his;
120    And if he were, he came into the world
121    Full fourteene weekes before the course of time:
122    Then good my Liedge let me haue what is mine,
123    My fathers land, as was my fathers #will.
124    <S {K.Iohn}.> Sirra, your brother is Legittimate,
125    Your fathers wife did after wedlocke beare him:
126    And if she did play false, the fault was hers,
127    Which fault lyes on the hazards of all husbands
128    That marry wiues: tell me, how if my brother
129    Who as you say, tooke paines to get this sonne,
130    Had of your father claim'd this sonne for his,
131    Insooth, good friend, your father might haue kept
132    This Calfe, bred from his Cow from all the world:
133    Insooth he might: then if he were my brothers,
134    My brother might not claime him, nor your father
135    Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes,
136    My mothers sonne did get your fathers heyre,
137    Your fathers heyre must haue your fathers land.
138    <S {Rob}.> Shal then my fathers #Will be of no force,
139    To dispossesse that childe which is not his.
140    <S {Phil}.> Of no more force to dispossesse me sir,
141    Then was his #will to get me, as I think.
142    <S {Eli}.> Whether hadst thou rather be a {Faulconbridge},
143    And like thy brother to enioy thy land:
144    Or the reputed sonne of {Cordelion},
145    Lord of thy presence, and no land beside.
146    <S {Bast}.> Madam, #and if my brother had my shape
147    And I had his, sir {Roberts} his like him,
148    And if my legs were two such riding rods,
149    My armes, such eele skins stuft, my face so thin,
150    That in mine eare I durst not sticke a rose,
151    Lest men should say, looke where three farthings goes,
152    And to his shape were heyre to all this land,
153    Would I might neuer stirre from off this place,
154    I would giue it euery foot to haue this face:
155    It would not be sir nobbe in any case.
156   *<S {Elinor}.> I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
157    Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?
158    I am a Souldier, and now bound to {France}.
159    <S {Bast}.> Brother, take you my land, Ile take my chance;
160    Your face hath got fiue hundred pound a yeere,
161    Yet sell your face for fiue pence and 'tis deere:
162    Madam, Ile follow you vnto the death.
163   *<S {Elinor}.> Nay, I would haue you go before me thither.
164    <S {Bast}.> Our Country manners giue our betters way.
165    <S {K.Iohn}.> What is thy name?
166    <S {Bast}.> {Philip} my Liege, so is my name begun,
167    {#Philip}, good old Sir {Roberts} wiues eldest sonne.
168    <S {K.Iohn}.> From henceforth beare his name
169    Whose forme thou bearest:
170    Kneele thou downe {Philip}, but rise more great,
171    Arise Sir {Richard}, and {Plantagenet}.
172   *<S {Bast}.> Brother by th' mothers side, giue me your hand,
173    My father gaue me honor, yours gaue land:
174    Now blessed be the houre by night or day
175    When I was got, Sir {Robert} was away.
176    <S {Ele}.> The very spirit of {Plantaginet}:
177    I am thy grandame {Richard}, call me so.
178   *<S {Bast}.> Madam by chance, but not by truth, what tho;
179    Something about a little from the right,
180    In at the window, or else ore the hatch:
181    Who dares not stirre by day, must walke by night,
182    And haue is #haue, how euer men doe catch:
183    Neere or farre off, well wonne is still well shot,
184    And I am I, how ere I was begot.
185   *<S {K.Iohn}.> Goe, {Faulconbridge}, now hast thou thy desire,
186    A landlesse Knight, makes thee a landed Squire:
187    Come Madam, and come {Richard}, we must speed
188    For {France}, for {France}, for it is more then need.
189    <S {Bast}.> Brother adieu, good fortune come to thee,
190    For thou wast got i'th way of honesty.
191    <D {Exeunt all but bastard}.>
192    <S {Bast}.> A foot of Honor better then I was,
193    But many a many foot of Land the worse.
194    Well, now can I make any {Ioane} a Lady,
195    Good den Sir {Richard}, Godamercy fellow,
196    And if his name be {George}, Ile call him {Peter};
197    For new made honor doth forget mens names:
198    'Tis two respectiue, and too sociable
199    For your conuersion, now your traueller,
200    Hee and his tooth- picke at my worships messe,
201    And when my knightly stomacke is suffis'd,
202    Why then I sucke my teeth, and catechize
203    My picked man of Countries: my deare sir,
204    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,
205    I shall beseech you; that is question now,
206    And then comes answer like an Absey booke:
207    O sir, sayes answer, at your best command,
208    At your employment, at your seruice sir:
209    No sir, saies question, #I sweet sir at yours,
210    And so ere answer knowes what question would,
211    Sauing in Dialogue of Complement,
212    And talking of the Alpes and Appenines,
213    The Perennean and the riuer {Poe},
214    It drawes  toward supper in conclusion so.
215    But this is worshipfull society,
216    And fits the mounting spirit like my selfe;
217    For he is but a bastard to the time
218    That doth not smoake of obseruation,
219    And so am I whether I smacke or no:
220    And not alone in habit and deuice,
221    Exterior forme, outward accoutrement;
222    But from the inward motion to deliuer
223    Sweet, sweet, sweet poyson for the ages tooth,
224    Which though I will not practice to deceiue,
225    Yet to auoid deceit I meane to learne;
226    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising:
227    But who comes in such haste in riding robes?
      <P a2>
228    What woman post is this? hath she no husband
229    That will take paines to blow a horne before her?
230    O me, 'tis my mother: how now good Lady,
231    What brings you heere to Court so hastily?
232    <D {Enter Lady Faulconbridge and Iames Gurney}.>
233   *<S {Lady}.> Where is that slaue thy brother? where is he?
234    That holds in chase mine honour vp and  downe.
235    <S {Bast}.> My brother {Robert}, old Sir {Roberts} sonne:
236    {Colbrand} the Gyant, that same mighty man,
237    Is it Sir {Roberts} sonne that you seeke so?
238    <S {Lady}.> Sir {Roberts} sonne, #I thou vnreuerend boy,
239    Sir {Roberts} sonne? why scorn'st thou at sir {Robert}?
240    He is Sir {Roberts} sonne, and so art thou.
241    <S {Bast}.> {Iames Gournie}, wilt thou giue vs leaue #a while?
242    <S {Gour}.> Good leaue good {Philip}.
243    <S {Bast}.> {Philip}, sparrow, {Iames},
244    There's toyes abroad, anon Ile tell thee more.
245    <D {Exit Iames}.>
246    Madam, I was not old Sir {Roberts} sonne,
247    Sir {Robert} might haue eat his part in me
248    Vpon good Friday, and nere broke his fast:
249    Sir {Robert} could doe well, marrie to confesse
250    Could get me sir {Robert} could not doe it;
251    We know his handy- worke, therefore good mother
252    To whom am I beholding for these limmes?
253    Sir {Robert} neuer holpe to make this legge.
254    <S {Lady}.> Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
255   *That for thine owne gaine shouldst defend mine honor?
256    What meanes this scorne, thou most vntoward knaue?
257    <S {Bast}.> Knight, knight good mother, Basilisco- like:
258    What, I am dub'd, I haue it on my shoulder:
259    But mother, I am not Sir {Roberts} sonne,
260    I haue disclaim'd Sir {Robert} and my land,
261    Legitimation, name, and all is gone;
262    Then good my mother, let me know my father,
263    Some proper man I hope, who was it mother?
264    <S {Lady}.> Hast thou denied thy selfe a {Faulconbridge}?
265    <S {Bast}.> As faithfully as I denie the deuill.
266    <S {Lady}.> {King Richard Cordelion} was thy father,
267    By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
268    To make roome for him in my husbands bed:
269    Heauen lay not my transgression to my charge,
270    That art the issue of my deere offence
271    Which was so strongly vrg'd past my defence.
272    <S {Bast}.> Now by this light were I to get againe,
273    Madam I would not wish a better father:
274    Some sinnes doe beare their priuiledge on earth,
275    And so doth yours: your fault, was not your follie,
276    Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
277    Subiected tribute to commanding loue,
278    Against whose furie and vnmatched force,
279    The awlesse Lion   could not wage the fight,
280    Nor keepe his Princely heart from {Richards} hand:
281    He that perforce robs Lions of their hearts,
282    May easily winne a womans: aye my mother,
283    With all my heart I thanke thee for my father:
284    Who liues and dares but say, thou didst not well
285    When I was got, Ile send his soule to #hell.
286    Come Lady I will shew thee to my kinne,
287    And they shall say, when {Richard} me begot,
288    If thou hadst sayd him nay, it had beene sinne;
289    Who sayes it was, he lyes, I say twas not.
290    <D {Exeunt}.>
291    <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
292   *<D {Enter before Angiers, Philip King of France, Lewis, Daul-phin},
293    {Austria, Constance, Arthur}.>
294    <S {Lewis}.> Before {Angiers} well met braue {Austria},
295    {#Arthur} that great fore- runner of thy bloud,
296    {Richard} that rob'd the Lion of his heart,
297    And fought the holy Warres in {Palestine},
298    By this braue Duke came early to his graue:
299    And for amends to his posteritie,
300    At our importance hether is he come,
301    To spread his colours boy, in thy behalfe,
302    And to rebuke the vsurpation
303    Of thy vnnaturall Vncle, English {Iohn},
304    Embrace him, loue him, giue him welcome hether.
305    <S {Arth}.> God shall forgiue you {Cordelions} death
306    The rather, that you giue his off- spring life,
307    Shadowing their right vnder your wings of warre:
308    I giue you welcome with a powerlesse hand,
309    But with a heart full of vnstained loue,
310    Welcome before the gates {Angiers} Duke.
311    <S {Lewis}.> A noble boy, who would not doe thee right?
312    <S {Aust}.> Vpon thy cheeke lay I this zelous kisse,
313    As seale to this indenture of my loue:
314    That to my home I will no more returne
315    Till {Angiers}, and the right thou hast in {France},
316    Together with that pale, that white- fac'd shore,
317    Whose foot spurnes backe the Oceans roaring tides,
318    And coopes from other lands her Ilanders,
319    Euen till that {England} hedg'd in with the maine,
320    That Water- walled Bulwarke, still secure
321    And confident from forreine purposes,
322    Euen till that vtmost corner of the West
323    Salute thee for her King, till then faire boy
324    Will I not thinke of home, but follow Armes.
325   *<S {Const}.> O take his mothers thanks, a widdows thanks,
326    Till your strong hand shall helpe to giue him strength,
327    To make a more requitall to your loue.
328   *<S {Aust}.> The peace of heauen is theirs y lift their swords
329    In such a iust and charitable warre.
330   *<S {King}.> Well, then to worke our Cannon shall be bent
331    Against the browes of this resisting towne,
332    Call for our cheefest men of discipline,
333    To cull the plots of best aduantages:
334    Wee'll lay before this towne our Royal bones,
335    Wade to the market- place in {French}- mens bloud,
336    But we will make it subiect to this boy.
337    <S {Con}.> Stay for an answer to your Embassie,
338    Lest vnaduis'd you staine your swords with bloud,
339    My Lord {Chattilion} may from {England} bring
340    That right in peace which heere we vrge in warre,
341    And then we shall repent each drop of bloud,
342    That hot rash haste so indirectly shedde.
343    <D {Enter Chattilion}.>
344    <S {King}.> A wonder Lady: lo vpon thy wish
345    Our Messenger {Chattilion} is arriu'd,
346    What {England} saies, say breefely gentle Lord,
347    We coldly pause for thee, {Chatilion} speake,
348    <S {Chat}.> Then turne your forces from this paltry siege,
349    And stirre them vp against a mightier taske:
350    {England} impatient of your iust demands,
351    Hath put himselfe in Armes, the aduerse windes
      <P a2v>
352    Whose leisure I haue staid, haue giuen him time
353    To land his Legions all as soone as I:
354    His marches are expedient to this towne,
355    His forces strong, his Souldiers confident:
356    With him along is come the Mother Queene,
357    An Ace stirring him to bloud and strife,
358    With her  her Neece, the Lady {Blanch of Spaine},
359    With them a Bastard of the Kings deceast,
360    And all th' vnsetled humors of the Land,
361    Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
362    With Ladies faces, and fierce Dragons spleenes,
363    Haue sold their fortunes at their natiue homes,
364    Bearing their birth- rights proudly on their backs,
365    To make a hazard of new fortunes heere:
366    In briefe, a brauer choyse of dauntlesse spirits
367    Then now the {English} bottomes haue waft o're,
368    Did neuer flote vpon the swelling tide,
369    To doe offence and scathe in Christendome:
370    The interruption of their churlish drums
371    Cuts off more circumstance, they are at hand,
372    <D {Drum beats}.>
373    To parlie or to fight, therefore prepare.
374    <S {Kin}.> How much vnlook'd for, is this expedition.
375    <S {Aust}.> By how much vnexpected, by so much
376    We must awake indeuor for defence,
377    For courage mounteth with occasion,
378    Let them be welcome then, we are prepar'd.
379   *<D {Enter K[ing]. of England, Bastard, Queene, Blanch, Pembroke},
380    {and others}.>
381   *<S {K.Iohn}.> Peace be to {France}: If France in peace permit
382    Our iust and lineall entrance to our owne;
383    If not, bleede {France}, and peace ascend to heauen.
384    Whiles we Gods wrathfull agent doe correct
385    Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heauen.
386    <S {Fran}.> Peace be to {England}, if that warre returne
387    From {France} to {England}, there to liue in peace:
388    {England} we loue, and for that {Englands} sake,
389    With burden of our armor heere we sweat:
390    This toyle of ours should be a worke of thine;
391    But thou from louing {England} art so farre,
392    That thou hast vnder- wrought his lawfull King,
393    Cut off the sequence of posterity,
394    Out- faced Infant State, and done a rape
395    Vpon the maiden vertue of the Crowne:
396    Looke heere vpon thy brother {Geffreyes} face,
397    These eyes, these browes, were moulded out of his;
398    This little abstract doth containe that large,
399    Which died in {Geffrey}: and the hand of time,
400    Shall draw this breefe into as huge a volume:
401    That {Geffrey} was thy elder brother borne,
402    And this his sonne, {England} was {Geffreys} right,
403    And this is {Geffreyes} in the name of God:
404    How comes it then that thou art call'd a King,
405    When liuing blood doth in these temples beat
406    Which owe the crowne, that thou ore- masterest?
407   *<S {K.Iohn}.> From whom hast thou this great commission |({France},
408    To draw my answer from thy Articles?
409   *<S {Fra}.> Fro[m] that supernal Iudge that stirs good thoughts
410    In any breast of strong authoritie,
411    To looke into the blots and staines of right,
412    That Iudge hath made me guardian to this boy,
413    Vnder whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
414    And by whose helpe I meane to chastise it.
415    <S {K.Iohn}.> Alack thou dost vsurpe authoritie.
416    <S {Fran}.> Excuse it is to beat vsurping downe.
417    <S {Queen}.> Who is it thou dost call vsurper {France}?
418    <S {Const}.> Let me make answer: thy vsurping sonne.
419    <S {Queen}.> Out insolent, thy bastard shall be King,
420    That thou maist be a Queen, and checke the world.
421    <S {Con}.> My bed was euer to thy sonne as true
422    As thine was to thy husband, and this boy
423    Liker in feature to his father {Geffrey}
424    Then thou and {Iohn}, in manners being as like,
425    As raine to water, or deuill to his damme;
426    My boy a bastard? by my soule I thinke
427    His father neuer was so true begot,
428    It cannot be, #and if thou wert his mother.
429   *<S {Queen}.> Theres a good mother boy, that blots thy fa-|(ther
430    <S {Const}.> There's a good grandame boy
431    That would blot thee.
432    <S {Aust}.> Peace.
433    <S {Bast}.> Heare the Cryer.
434    <S {Aust}.> What the deuill art thou?
435    <S {Bast}.> One that wil play the deuill sir with you,
436    #And #a may catch your hide and you alone:
437    You are the Hare of whom the Prouerb goes
438    Whose valour plucks dead Lyons by the beard;
439    Ile smoake your skin- coat #and I catch you right,
440    Sirra looke too't, yfaith I will, yfaith.
441    <S {Blan}.> O well did he become that Lyons robe,
442    That did disrobe the Lion of that robe.
443    <S {Bast}.> It lies as sightly on the backe of him
444    As great {Alcides} shooes vpon an Asse:
445    But Asse, Ile take that burthen from your backe,
446    Or lay on that shall make your shoulders cracke.
447   *<S {Aust}.> What cracker is this same that deafes our eares
448    With this abundance of superfluous breath?
449    King {Lewis}, determine what we shall doe strait.
450   *<S {Lew}.> Women & fooles, breake off your conference.
451    King {Iohn}, this is the very summe of all:
452    {England} and {Ireland, Angiers, Toraine, Maine},
453    In right of {Arthur} doe I claime of thee:
454    Wilt thou resigne them, and lay downe thy Armes?
455    <S {Iohn}.> My life as soone: I doe defie thee {France},
456    {#Arthur} of {Britaine}, yeeld thee to my hand,
457    And out of my deere loue Ile giue thee more,
458    Then ere the coward hand of {France} can win;
459    Submit thee boy.
460    <S {Queen}.> Come to thy grandame child.
461    <S {Cons}.> Doe childe, goe to yt grandame childe,
462    Giue grandame kingdome, and #it grandame will
463    Giue yt a plum, a cherry, and a figge,
464    There's a good grandame.
465    <S {Arthur}.> Good my mother peace,
466    I would that I were low laid in my graue,
467    I am not worth this coyle that's made for me.
468   *<S {Qu.Mo}.> His mother shames him so, poore boy hee |(weepes.
469    <S {Con}.> Now shame vpon you #where she does or no,
470    His grandames wrongs, and not his mothers shames
471   *Drawes those heauen- mouing pearles fro[m] his poor eies,
472    Which heauen shall take in nature of a fee:
473    #I, with these Christall beads heauen shall be brib'd
474    To doe him Iustice, and reuenge on you.
475    <S {Qu}.> Thou monstrous slanderer of heauen and earth.
476    <S {Con}.> Thou monstrous Iniurer of heauen and earth,
477    Call not me slanderer, thou and thine vsurpe
478    The Dominations, Royalties, and rights
479    Of this oppressed boy; this is thy eldest sonnes sonne,
480    Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
      <P a3><C B>
481    Thy sinnes are visited in this poore childe,
482    The Canon of the Law is laide on him,
483    Being but the second generation
484    Remoued from thy sinne- conceiuing wombe.
485    <S {Iohn}.> Bedlam haue done.
486    <S {Con}.> I haue but this to say,
487    That he is not onely plagued for her sin,
488    But God hath made her sinne and her, the plague
489    On this remoued issue, plagued for her,
490    And with her plague her sinne: his iniury
491    Her iniurie the Beadle to her sinne,
492    All punish'd in the person of this childe,
493    And all for her, a plague vpon her.
494    <S {Que}.> Thou vnaduised scold, I can produce
495    A #Will, that barres the title of thy sonne.
496    <S {Con}.> #I who doubts that, a #Will: a wicked #will,
497    A womans #will, a cankred Grandams #will.
498    <S {Fra}.> Peace Lady, pause, or be more temperate,
499    It #ill beseemes this presence to cry ayme
500    To these ill- tuned repetitions:
501    Some Trumpet summon hither to the walles
502    These men of Angiers, let vs heare them speake,
503    Whose title they admit, {Arthurs} or {Iohns}.
504    <D {Trumpet sounds}.
505    {Enter a Citizen vpon the walles}.>
506    <S {Cit}.> Who is it that hath warn'd vs to the walles?
507    <S {Fra}.> 'Tis France, for England.
508    <S {Iohn}.> England for it selfe:
509    You men of Angiers, and my louing subiects.
510    <S {Fra}.> You louing men of Angiers, {Arthurs} subiects,
511    Our Trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle.
512    <S {Iohn}.> For our aduantage, therefore heare vs first:
513    These flagges of France that are aduanced heere
514    Before the eye and prospect of your Towne,
515    Haue hither march'd to your endamagement.
516    The Canons haue their bowels full of wrath,
517    And ready mounted are they to spit forth
518    Their Iron indignation 'gainst your walles:
519    All preparation for a bloody siedge
520    And merciles proceeding, by these French.
521    Comfort your Citties eies, your winking gates:
522    And but for our approch, those sleeping stones,
523    That as a waste doth girdle you about
524    By the compulsion of their Ordinance,
525    By this time from their fixed beds of lime
526    Had bin dishabited, and wide hauocke made
527    For bloody power to rush vppon your peace.
528    But on the sight of vs your lawfull King,
529    Who painefully with much expedient march
530    Haue brought a counter- checke before your gates,
531    To saue vnscratch'd your Citties threatned cheekes:
532    Behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe  a parle,
533    And now insteed of bulletts wrapt in fire
534    To make a shaking feuer in your walles,
535    They shoote but calme words, folded vp in smoake,
536    To make a faithlesse errour in your eares,
537    Which trust accordingly kinde Cittizens,
538    And let vs in. Your King, whose labour'd spirits
539    Fore- wearied in this action of swift speede,
540    Craues harbourage within your Citie walles.
541    <S {France}.> When I haue saide, make answer to vs both.
542    Loe in this right hand, whose protection
543    Is most diuinely vow'd vpon the right
544    Of him it holds, stands yong {Plantagenet},
545    Sonne to the elder brother of this man,
546    And King ore him, and all that he enioyes:
547    For this downe- troden equity, we tread
548    In warlike march, these greenes before your Towne,
549    Being no further enemy to you
550    Then the constraint of hospitable zeale,
551    In the releefe of this oppressed childe,
552    Religiously prouokes. Be pleased then
553    To pay that dutie which you truly owe,
554    To him that owes it, namely, this yong Prince,
555    And then our Armes, like to a muzled Beare,
556    Saue in aspect, hath all offence seal'd vp:
557    Our Cannons malice vainly shall be spent
558    Against th' involnerable clouds of heauen,
559    And with a blessed and vn- vext retyre,
560    With vnhack'd swords, and Helmets all vnbruis'd,
561    We will beare home that  lustie blood againe,
562    Which heere we came to spout against your Towne,
563    And leaue your children, wiues, and you in peace.
564    But if you fondly passe our proffer'd offer,
565    'Tis not the rounder of your old- fac'd walles,
566    Can hide you from our messengers of Warre,
567    Though all these English, and their discipline
568    Were harbour'd in their rude circumference:
569    Then tell vs, Shall your Citie call vs Lord,
570    In that behalfe which we haue challeng'd it?
571    Or shall we giue the signall to our rage,
572    And stalke in blood to our possession?
573   *<S {Cit}.> In breefe, we are the King of Englands subiects
574    For him, and in his right, we hold this Towne.
575    <S {Iohn}.> Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
576    <S {Cit}.> That can we not: but he that proues the King
577    To him will we proue loyall, till that time
578    Haue we ramm'd vp our gates against the world.
579   *<S {Iohn}.> Doth not the Crowne of England, prooue the
580    King?
581    And if not that, I bring you Witnesses
582    Twice fifteene thousand hearts of Englands breed.
583    <S {Bast}.> Bastards and else.
584    <S {Iohn}.> To verifie our title with their liues.
585    <S {Fran}.> As many and as well- borne bloods as those.
586    <S {Bast}.> Some Bastards too.
587    <S {Fran}.> Stand in his face to contradict his claime.
588    <S {Cit}.> Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
589    We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
590   *<S {Iohn}.> Then God forgiue the sinne of all those soules,
591    That to their euerlasting residence,
592    Before the dew of euening fall, shall fleete
593    In dreadfull triall of our kingdomes King.
594    <S {Fran}.> Amen, Amen, mount Cheualiers to Armes.
595    <S {Bast}.> Saint {George} that swindg'd the Dragon,
596   *And ere since sit's on's horsebacke at mine Hostesse dore
597    Teach vs some sence. Sirrah, were I at home
598    At your den sirrah, with your Lionnesse,
599    I would set an Oxe- head to your Lyons hide:
600    And make a monster of you.
601    <S {Aust}.> Peace, no more.
602    <S {Bast}.> O tremble: for you heare the Lyon rore.
603    <S {Iohn}.> Vp higher to the plaine, where #we'l  set forth
604    In best appointment all our Regiments.
605    <S {Bast}.> Speed then to take aduantage of the field.
606    <S {Fra}.> It shall be so, and at the other hill
607   *Command the rest to stand, God and our right.  <D {Exeunt}>
608    <D {Heere after excursions, Enter the Herald of {France}
609    {with Trumpets to the gates}.>
610    <S {F.Her}.> You men of Angiers open wide your gates,
611    And let yong {Arthur} Duke of Britaine in,
      <P a3v>
612    Who by the hand of France, this day hath made
613    Much worke for teares in many an English mother,
614    Whose sonnes lye scattered on the bleeding ground:
615    Many a widdowes husband groueling lies,
616    Coldly embracing the discoloured earth,
617    And victorie with little losse doth play
618    Vpon the dancing banners of the French,
619    Who are at hand triumphantly displayed
620    To enter Conquerors, and to proclaime
621    {#Arthur} of Britaine, Englands King, and yours.
622    <D {Enter English Herald with Trumpet}.>
623   *<S {E.Har}.> Reioyce you men of Angiers, ring your bels,
624    King {Iohn}, your king and Englands, doth approach,
625    Commander of this hot malicious day,
626    Their Armours that march'd hence so siluer bright,
627    Hither returne all gilt with Frenchmens blood:
628    There stucke no plume in any English Crest,
629    That is remoued by a staffe of France.
630    Our colours do returne in those same hands
631    That did display them when we first marcht forth:
632    And like a iolly troope of Huntsmen come
633    Our lustie English, all with purpled hands,
634    Dide in the dying slaughter of their foes,
635    Open your gates, and giue the Victors way.
636   *<S {Hubert}.> Heralds, from off our towres we might behold
637    From first to last, the on- set and retyre:
638    Of both your Armies, whose equality
639    By our best eyes cannot be censured:
640    Blood hath bought blood, and blowes haue answerd |(blowes:
641   *Strength matcht with strength, and power confronted
642    power,
643    Both are alike, and both alike we like:
644    One must proue greatest. While they weigh so euen,
645    We hold our Towne for neither: yet for both.
646    <D {Enter the two Kings with their powers},
647    {at seuerall doores}.>
648   *<S {Iohn}.> France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
649    Say, shall the currant of our right rome on,
650    Whose passage vext with thy impediment,
651    Shall leaue his natiue channell, and ore- swell
652    With course disturb'd euen thy confining shores,
653    Vnlesse thou let his siluer Water, keepe
654    A peacefull progresse to the Ocean.
655    <S {Fra}.> England thou hast not sau'd one drop of blood
656    In this hot triall more then we of France,
657    Rather lost more. And by this hand I sweare
658    That swayes the earth this Climate ouer- lookes,
659    Before we will lay downe our iust- borne Armes,
660    Wee'l put thee downe, 'gainst whom these Armes wee |(beare,
661    Or adde a royall number to the dead:
662    Gracing the scroule that tels of this warres losse,
663    With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
664    <S {Bast}.> Ha Maiesty: how high thy glory towres,
665    When the rich blood of kings is set on fire:
666    Oh now doth death line his dead chaps with steele,
667    The swords of souldiers are his teeth, his phangs,
668    And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men
669    In vndetermin'd differences of kings.
670    Why stand these royall fronts amazed thus:
671    Cry hauocke kings, backe to the stained field
672    You equall Potents, fierie kindled spirits,
673    Then let confusion of one part confirm
674    The others peace: till then, blowes, blood, and death.
675    <S {Iohn}.> Whose party do the Townesmen yet admit?
676    <S {Fra}.> Speake Citizens for England, whose your king.
677   *<S {Hub}.> The king of England, when we know the king.
678    <S {Fra}.> Know him in vs, that heere hold vp his right.
679    <S {Iohn}.> In Vs, that are our owne great Deputie,
680    And beare possession of our Person heere,
681    Lord of our presence Angiers, and of you.
682    <S {Fra}.> A greater powre then We denies all this,
683    And till it be vndoubted, we do locke
684    Our former scruple in our strong barr'd gates:
685    Kings of our feare, vntill our feares resolu'd
686    Be by some certaine king, purg'd and depos'd.
687   *<S {Bast}.> By heauen, these scroyles of Angiers flout you |(kings,
688    And stand securely on their battelments,
689    As in a Theater, whence they gape and point
690    At your industrious Scenes and acts of death.
691    Your Royall presences be rul'd by mee,
692    Do like the Mutines of Ierusalem,
693    Be friends a- while, and both conioyntly bend
694    Your sharpest Deeds of malice on this Towne.
695    By East and West let France and England mount.
696    Their battering Canon charged to the mouthes,
697    Till their soule- fearing clamours haue braul'd downe
698    The flintie ribbes of this contemptuous Citie,
699    I'de play incessantly vpon these Iades,
700    Euen till vnfenced desolation
701    Leaue them as naked as the vulgar ayre:
702    That done, disseuer your vnited strengths,
703    And part your mingled colours once againe,
704    Turne face to face, and bloody point to point:
705    Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
706    Out of one side her happy Minion,
707    To whom in fauour she shall giue the day,
708    And kisse him with a glorious victory:
709    How like you this wilde counsell mighty States,
710    Smackes it not something of the policie.
711    <S {Iohn}.> Now by the sky that hangs aboue our heads,
712    I like it well. France, shall we knit our powres,
713    And lay this Angiers euen with the ground,
714    Then after fight who shall be king of it?
715    <S {Bast}.> #And if thou hast the mettle of a king,
716    Being wrong'd as we are by this peeuish Towne:
717    Turne thou the mouth of thy Artillerie,
718    As we will ours, against these sawcie walles,
719    And when that we haue dash'd them to the ground,
720    Why then defie each other, and pell- mell,
721    Make worke vpon our selues, for heauen or #hell.
722    <S {Fra}.> Let it be so: say, where will you assault?
723    <S {Iohn}.> We from the West will send destruction
724    Into this Cities bosome.
725    <S {Aust}.> I from the North.
726    <S {Fran}.> Our Thunder from the South,
727    Shall raine their drift of bullets on this Towne.
728    <S {Bast}.> O prudent discipline! From North to South:
729    Austria and France shoot in each others mouth.
730    Ile stirre them to it: Come, away, away.
731   *<S {Hub}.> Heare vs great kings, vouchsafe awhile to stay
732    And I shall shew you peace, and faire- fac'd league:
733    Win you this Citie without stroke, or wound,
734    Rescue those breathing liues to dye in beds,
735    That heere come sacrifices for the field.
736    Perseuer not, but heare me mighty kings.
737    <S {Iohn}.> Speake on with fauour, we are bent to heare.
738   *<S {Hub}.> That daughter there of Spaine, the Lady {Blanch}
739    Is neere to England, looke vpon the yeeres
740    Of {Lewes} the Dolphin, and that louely maid.
741    If lustie loue should go in quest of beautie,
      <P a4>
742    Where should he finde it fairer, then in {Blanch}:
743    If zealous loue should go in search of vertue,
744    Where should he finde it purer then in {Blanch}?
745    If loue ambitious, sought a match of birth,
746    Whose veines bound richer blood then Lady {Blanch}?
747    Such as she is, in beautie, vertue, birth,
748    Is the yong Dolphin euery way compleat,
749    If not compleat of, say he is not shee,
750    And she againe wants nothing, to name want,
751    If want it be not, that she is not hee.
752    He is the halfe part of a blessed man,
753    Left to be finished by such as shee,
754    And she a faire diuided excellence,
755    Whose fulnesse of perfection lyes in him.
756    O two such siluer currents when they ioyne
757    Do glorifie the bankes that bound them in:
758    And two such shores, to two such streames made one,
759    Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
760    To these two Princes, if you marrie them:
761    This Vnion shall do more then batterie can
762    To our fast closed gates: for at this match,
763    With swifter spleene then powder can enforce
764    The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
765    And giue you entrance: but without this match,
766    The sea enraged is not halfe so deafe,
767    Lyons more confident, Mountaines and rockes
768    More free from motion, no not death himselfe
769    In mortall furie halfe so peremptorie,
770    As we to keepe this Citie.
771    <S {Bast}.> Heeres a stay,
772    That shakes the rotten carkasse of old death
773    Out of his ragges. Here's a large mouth indeede,
774   *That spits forth death, and mountaines, rockes, and seas,
775    Talkes as familiarly of roaring Lyons,
776    As maids of thirteene do of puppi- dogges.
777    What Cannoneere begot this lustie blood,
778   *He speakes plaine Cannon fire, and smoake, and bounce,
779    He giues the bastinado with his tongue:
780    Our eares are cudgel'd, not a word of his
781    But buffets better then a fist of France:
782    Zounds, I was neuer so bethumpt with words,
783    Since I first cal'd my brothers father Dad.
784   *<S {Old} {Qu}.> Son, list to this coniunction, make this match
785    Giue with our Neece a dowrie large enough,
786    For by this knot, thou shalt so surely tye
787    Thy now vnsur'd assurance to the Crowne,
788    That yon greene boy shall haue no Sunne to ripe
789    The bloome that promiseth a mightie fruite.
790    I see a yeelding in the lookes of France:
791    Marke how they whisper, vrge them while their soules
792    Are capeable of this ambition,
793    Least zeale now melted by the windie breath
794    Of soft petitions, pittie and remorse,
795    Coole and congeale againe to what it was.
796    <S {Hub}.> Why answer not the double Maiesties,
797    This friendly treatie of our threatned Towne.
798   *<S {Fra}.> Speake England first, that hath bin forward first
799    To speake vnto this Cittie: what say you?
800    <S {Iohn}.> If that the Dolphin there thy Princely sonne,
801    Can in this booke of beautie read, I loue:
802    Her Dowrie shall weigh equall with a Queene:
803    For {Angiers}, and faire {Toraine} {Maine}, {Poyctiers},
804    And all that we vpon this side the Sea,
805    (Except this Cittie now by vs besiedg'd)
806    Finde liable to our Crowne and Dignitie,
807    Shall gild her bridall bed and make her rich
808    In titles, honors, and promotions,
809    As she in beautie, education, blood,
810    Holdes hand with any Princesse of the world.
811   *<S {Fra}.> What sai'st thou boy? looke in the Ladies face.
812    <S {Dol}.> I do my Lord, and in her eie I find
813    A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
814    The shadow of my selfe form'd in her eye,
815    Which being but the shadow of your sonne,
816    Becomes a sonne and makes your sonne a shadow:
817    I do protest I neuer lou'd my selfe
818    Till now, infixed I beheld my selfe,
819    Drawne in the flattering table of her eie.
820    <D {Whispers with Blanch}.>
821    <S {Bast}.> Drawne in the flattering table of her eie,
822    Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,
823    And quarter'd in her heart, hee doth espie
824    Himselfe loues traytor, this is pittie now;
825   *That hang'd, and drawne, and quarter'd there should be
826    In such a loue, so vile a Lout as he.
827    <S {Blan}.> My vnckles #will in this respect is mine,
828    If he see ought in you that makes him like,
829    That any thing he see's which moues his liking,
830    I can with ease translate it to my #will:
831    Or if you will, to speake more properly,
832    I will enforce it easlie to my loue.
833    Further I will not flatter you, my Lord,
834    That all I see in you is worthie loue,
835    Then this, that nothing do I see in you,
836   *Though churlish thoughts themselues should bee your
837    Iudge,
838    That I can finde, should merit any hate.
839   *<S {Iohn}.> What saie these yong- ones? What say you my
840    Neece?
841    <S {Blan}.> That she is bound in honor still to do
842    What you in wisedome still vouchsafe to say.
843   *<S {Iohn}.> Speake then Prince Dolphin, can you loue this
844    Ladie?
845    <S {Dol}.> Nay aske me if I can refraine from loue,
846    For I doe loue her most vnfainedly.
847    <S {Iohn}.> Then I doe giue {Volquessen}, {Toraine}, {Maine},
848    {Poyctiers} and {Aniow}, these fiue Prouinces
849    With her to thee, and this addition more,
850    Full thirty thousand Markes of English coyne:
851    {Phillip} of France, if thou be pleas'd withall,
852    Command thy sonne and daughter to ioyne hands.
853   *<S {Fra}.> It likes vs well young Princes: close your hands
854    <S {Aust}.> And your lippes too, for I am well assur'd,
855    That I did so when I was first assur'd.
856    <S {Fra}.> Now Cittizens of Angires ope your gates,
857    Let in that amitie which you haue made,
858    For at Saint Maries Chappell presently,
859    The rights of marriage shallbe solemniz'd.
860    Is not the Ladie {Constance} in this troope?
861    I know she is not for this match made vp,
862    Her presence would haue interrupted much.
863    Where is she and her sonne, tell me, who knowes?
864   *<S {Dol}.> She is sad and passionate at your highnes Tent.
865   *<S {Fra}.> And by my faith, this league that we haue made
866    Will giue her sadnesse very little cure:
867    Brother of England, how may we content
868    This widdow Lady? In her right we came,
869    Which we God knowes, haue turn'd another way,
870    To our owne vantage.
871    <S {Iohn}.> We will heale vp all,
872    For wee'l create yong {Arthur} Duke of Britaine
873    And Earle of Richmond, and this rich faire Towne
      <P a4v>
874    We make him Lord of. Call the Lady {Constance},
875    Some speedy Messenger bid her repaire
876    To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
877    (If not fill vp the measure of her #will)
878    Yet in some measure satisfie her so,
879    That we shall stop her exclamation,
880    Go we as well as #hast will suffer vs,
881    To this vnlook'd for vnprepared pompe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
882    <S {Bast}.> Mad world, mad kings, mad composition:
883    {#Iohn} to stop {Arthurs} Title in the whole,
884    Hath willingly departed with a part,
885    And France, whose armour Conscience buckled on,
886    Whom zeale and charitie brought to the field,
887    As Gods owne souldier, rounded in the eare,
888    With that same purpose- changer, that slye diuel,
889    That Broker, that still breakes the pate of faith,
890    That dayly breake- vow, he that winnes of all,
891    Of kings, of beggers, old men, yong men, maids,
892    Who hauing no externall thing to loose,
893    But the word Maid, cheats the poore Maide of that.
894    That smooth- fac'd Gentleman, tickling commoditie,
895    Commoditie, the byas of the world,
896    The world, who of it selfe is peysed well,
897    Made to run euen, vpon euen ground;
898    Till this aduantage, this vile drawing byas,
899    This sway of motion, this commoditie,
900    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
901    From all direction, purpose, course, intent.
902    And this same byas, this Commoditie,
903    This Bawd, this Broker, this all- changing- word,
904    Clap'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
905    Hath drawne him from his owne determin'd ayd,
906    From a resolu'd and honourable warre,
907    To a most base and vile- concluded peace.
908    And why rayle I on this Commoditie?
909    But for because he hath not wooed me yet:
910    Not that I haue the power to clutch my hand,
911    When his faire Angels would salute my palme,
912    But for my hand, as vnattempted yet,
913    Like a poore begger, raileth on the rich.
914    Well, whiles I am a begger, I will raile,
915    And say there is no sin but to be rich:
916    And being rich, my vertue then shall be,
917    To say there is no vice, but beggerie:
918    Since Kings breake faith vpon commoditie,
919    Gaine be my Lord, for I will worship thee.  <D {Exit}.>
920    <Z {Actus Secundus}>
921    <D {Enter Constance, Arthur, and Salisbury}.>
922   *<S {Con}.> Gone to be married? Gone to sweare a peace?
923    False blood to false blood ioyn'd. Gone to be freinds?
924   *Shall {Lewis} haue {Blaunch}, and {Blaunch} those Prouinces?
925    It is not so, thou hast mispoke, misheard,
926    Be well aduis'd, tell ore thy tale againe.
927    It cannot be, thou do'st but say 'tis so.
928    I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
929    Is but the vaine breath of a common man:
930    Beleeue me, I doe not beleeue thee man,
931    I haue a Kings oath to the contrarie.
932    Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
933    For I am sicke, and capeable of feares,
934    Opprest with wrongs, and therefore full of feares,
935    A widdow, husbandles, subiect to feares,
936    A woman naturally borne to feares;
937    And though thou now confesse thou didst but iest
938    With my vext spirits, I cannot take a Truce,
939    But they will quake and tremble all this day.
940    What dost thou meane by shaking of thy head?
941    Why dost thou looke so sadly on my sonne?
942    What meanes that hand vpon that breast of thine?
943    Why holdes thine eie that lamentable rhewme,
944    Like a proud riuer peering ore his bounds?
945    Be these sad signes confirmers of thy words?
946    Then speake againe, not all thy former tale,
947    But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
948    <S {Sal}.> As true as I beleeue you thinke them false,
949    That giue you cause to proue my saying true.
950    <S {Con}.> Oh if thou teach me to beleeue this sorrow,
951    Teach thou this sorrow, how to make me dye,
952    And let beleefe, and life encounter so,
953    As doth the furie of two desperate men,
954    Which in the very meeting fall, and dye.
955    {Lewes} marry {Blaunch}? O boy, then where art thou?
956    {France} friend with {England}, what becomes of me?
957    Fellow be gone: I cannot brooke thy sight,
958    This newes hath made thee a most vgly man.
959    <S {Sal}.> What other harme haue I good Lady done,
960    But spoke the harme, that is by others done?
961    <S {Con}.> Which harme within it selfe so heynous is,
962    As it makes harmefull all that speake of it.
963    <S {Ar}.> I do beseech you Madam be content.
964    <S {Con}.> If thou that bidst me be content, wert grim
965    Vgly, and slandrous to thy Mothers wombe,
966    Full of vnpleasing blots, and sightlesse staines,
967    Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
968    Patch'd with foule Moles, and eye- offending markes,
969    I would not care, I then would be content,
970    For then I should not loue thee: no, nor thou
971    Become thy great birth, nor deserue a Crowne.
972    But thou art faire, and at thy birth (deere boy)
973    Nature and Fortune ioyn'd to make thee great.
974    Of Natures guifts, thou mayst with Lillies boast,
975    And with the halfe- blowne Rose. But Fortune, oh,
976    She is corrupted, chang'd, and wonne from thee,
977    Sh' adulterates hourely with thine Vnckle {Iohn},
978    And with her golden hand hath pluckt on France
979    To tread downe faire respect of Soueraigntie,
980    And made his Maiestie the bawd to theirs.
981    France is a Bawd to Fortune, and king {Iohn},
982    That strumpet Fortune, that vsurping {Iohn}:
983    Tell me thou fellow, is not France forsworne?
984    Envenom him with words, or get thee gone,
985    And leaue those woes alone, which I alone
986    Am bound to vnder- beare.
987    <S {Sal}.> Pardon me Madam,
988    I may not goe without you to the  kings.
989   *<S {Con}.> Thou maist, thou shalt, I will not go with thee,
990    I will instruct my sorrowes to bee proud,
991    For greefe is proud, and makes his owner stoope,
992    To me and to the state of my great greefe,
993    Lets kings assemble: for my greefe's so great,
994    That no supporter but the huge firme earth
995    Can hold it vp: here I and sorrowes sit,
996    Heere is my Throne bid kings come bow to it.

998   *<D {Enter King Iohn, France, Dolphin, Blanch, Elianor, Philip},
999    {Austria, Constance}.>
1000   <S {Fran}.> 'Tis true (faire daughter) and this blessed day,
1001   Euer in {France} shall be kept festiuall:
1002   To solemnize this day the glorious sunne
1003   Stayes in his course, and playes the Alchymist,
1004   Turning with splendor of his precious eye
1005   The meager cloddy earth to glittering gold:
1006   The yearely course that brings this day about,
1007   Shall neuer see it, but a holy day.
1008   <S {Const}.> A wicked day, and not a holy day.
1009   What hath this day deseru'd? what hath it done,
1010   That it in golden letters should be set
1011   Among the high tides in the Kalender?
1012   Nay, rather turne this day out of the weeke,
1013   This day of shame, oppression, periury.
1014   Or if it must stand still, let wiues with childe
1015   Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
1016   Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crost:
1017   But (on this day) let Sea- men feare no wracke,
1018   No bargaines breake that are not this day made;
1019   This day all things begun, come to #ill end,
1020   Yea, faith it selfe to hollow falshood change.
1021   <S {Fra}.> By heauen Lady, you shall haue no cause
1022   To curse the faire proceedings of this day:
1023   Haue I not pawn'd to you my Maiesty?
1024   <S {Const}.> You haue beguil'd me with a counterfeit
1025   Resembling Maiesty, which being touch'd and tride,
1026   Proues valuelesse: you are forsworne, forsworne,
1027   You came in Armes to spill mine enemies bloud,
1028   But now in Armes, you strengthen it with yours.
1029   The grapling vigor, and rough frowne of Warre
1030   Is cold in amitie, and painted peace,
1031   And our oppression hath made vp this league:
1032   Arme, arme, you heauens, against these periur'd Kings,
1033   A widdow cries, be husband to me (heauens)
1034   Let not the howres of this vngodly day
1035   Weare out the daies in Peace; but ere Sun- set,
1036   Set armed discord 'twixt these periur'd Kings,
1037   Heare me, Oh, heare me.
1038   <S {Aust}.> Lady {Constance}, peace.
1039   <S {Const}.> War, war, no peace, peace is to me a warre:
1040   O {Lymoges}, O {Austria}, thou dost shame
1041  *That bloudy spoyle: thou slaue, thou wretch, y coward,
1042   Thou little valiant, great in villanie,
1043   Thou euer strong vpon the stronger side;
1044   Thou Fortunes Champion, that do'st neuer fight
1045   But when her humourous Ladiship is by
1046   To teach thee safety: thou art periur'd too,
1047   And sooth'st vp greatnesse. What a foole art thou,
1048   A ramping foole, to brag, and stamp, and sweare,
1049   Vpon my partie: thou cold blooded slaue,
1050   Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?
1051   Beene sworne my Souldier, bidding me depend
1052   Vpon thy starres, thy fortune, and thy strength,
1053   And dost thou now fall ouer to my foes?
1054   Thou weare a Lyons hide, doff it for shame,
1055   And hang a Calues skin on those recreant limbes.
1056  *<S {Aus}.> O that a man should speake those words to me.
1057  *<S {Phil}.> And hang a Calues- skin on those recreant limbs
1058   <S {Aus}.> Thou dar'st not say so villaine for thy life.
1059  *<S {Phil}.> And hang a Calues- skin on those recreant limbs.
1060   <S {Iohn}.> We like not this, thou dost forget thy selfe.
1061   <D {Enter Pandulph}.>
1062   <S {Fra}.> Heere comes the holy Legat of the Pope.
1063   <S {Pan}.> Haile you annointed deputies of heauen;
1064   To thee King {Iohn} my holy errand is:
1065   I {Pandulph}, of faire {Millane} Cardinall,
1066   And from Pope {Innocent} the Legate heere,
1067   Doe in his name religiously demand
1068   Why thou against the Church, our holy Mother,
1069   So wilfully dost spurne; and force perforce
1070   Keepe {Stephen Langton} chosen Archbishop
1071   Of {Canterbury} from that holy Sea:
1072   This in our foresaid holy Fathers name
1073   Pope {Innocent}, I doe demand of thee.
1074   <S {Iohn}.> What earthie name to Interrogatories
1075   Can tast the free breath of a sacred King?
1076   Thou canst not (Cardinall) deuise a name
1077   So slight, vnworthy, and ridiculous
1078   To charge me to an answere, as the Pope:
1079   Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of {England},
1080   Adde thus much more, that no {Italian} Priest
1081   Shall tythe or toll in our dominions:
1082   But as we, vnder heauen, are supreame head,
1083   So vnder him that great supremacy
1084   Where we doe reigne, we will alone vphold
1085   Without th' assistance of a mortall hand:
1086   So tell the Pope, all reuerence set apart
1087   To him and his vsurp'd authoritie.
1088   <S {Fra}.> Brother of {England}, you blaspheme in this.
1089  *<S {Iohn}.> Though you, and all the Kings of Christendom
1090   Are led so grossely by this medling Priest,
1091   Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
1092   And by the merit of vilde gold, drosse, dust,
1093   Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
1094   Who in that sale sels pardon from himselfe:
1095   Though you, and al the rest so grossely led,
1096   This iugling witchcraft with reuennue cherish,
1097   Yet I alone, alone doe me oppose
1098   Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.
1099   <S {Pand}.> Then by the lawfull power that I haue,
1100   Thou shalt stand curst, and excommunicate,
1101   And blessed shall he be that doth reuolt
1102   From his Allegeance to an heretique,
1103   And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
1104   Canonized and worship'd as a Saint,
1105   That takes away by any secret course
1106   Thy hatefull life.
1107   <S {Con}.> O lawfull let it be
1108   That I haue roome with {Rome} to curse #a while,
1109   Good Father Cardinall, cry thou Amen
1110   To my keene curses; for without my wrong
1111   There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
1112  *<S {Pan}.> There's Law and Warrant (Lady) for my curse.
1113   <S {Cons}.> And for mine too, when Law can do no right.
1114   Let it be lawfull, that Law barre no wrong:
1115   Law cannot giue my childe his kingdome heere;
1116   For he that holds his Kingdome, holds the Law:
1117   Therefore since Law it selfe is perfect wrong,
1118   How can the Law forbid my tongue to curse?
1119   <S {Pand}.> {Philip} of {France}, on perill of a curse,
1120   Let goe the hand of that Arch- heretique,
1121   And raise the power of {France} vpon his head,
1122   Vnlesse he doe submit himselfe to {Rome}.
1123  *<S {Elea}.> Look'st thou pale {France}? do not let go thy hand.
1124   <S {Con}.> Looke to that Deuill, lest that {France} repent,
      <P a5v>
1125   And by disioyning hands #hell lose a soule.
1126   <S {Aust}.> King {Philip}, listen to the Cardinall.
1127   <S {Bast}.> And hang a Calues- skin on his recreant limbs.
1128   <S {Aust}.> Well ruffian, I must pocket vp these wrongs,
1129   Because,
1130   <S {Bast}.> Your breeches best may carry them.
1131   <S {Iohn}.> {Philip}, what saist thou to the Cardinall?
1132   <S {Con}.> What should he say, but as the Cardinall?
1133   <S {Dolph}.> Bethinke you father, for the difference
1134   Is purchase of a heauy curse from {Rome},
1135   Or the light losse of {England}, for a friend:
1136   Forgoe the easier.
1137   <S {Bla}.> That's the curse of {Rome}.
1138   <S {Con}.> O {Lewis}, stand fast, the deuill tempts thee heere
1139   In likenesse of a new vntrimmed Bride.
1140  *<S {Bla}.> The Lady {Constance} speakes not from her faith,
1141   But from her need.
1142   <S {Con}.> Oh, if thou grant my need,
1143   Which onely liues but by the death of faith,
1144   That need, must needs inferre this principle,
1145   That faith would liue againe by death of need:
1146   O then tread downe my need, and faith mounts vp,
1147   Keepe my need vp, and faith is trodden downe.
1148   <S {Iohn}.> The king is moud, and answers not to this.
1149   <S {Con}.> O be remou'd from him, and answere well.
1150   <S {Aust}.> Doe so king {Philip}, hang no more in doubt.
1151  *<S {Bast}.> Hang nothing but a Calues skin most sweet lout.
1152   <S {Fra}.> I am perplext, and know not what to say.
1153  *<S {Pan}.> What canst thou say, but wil perplex thee more?
1154   If thou stand excommunicate, and curst?
1155   <S {Fra}.> Good reuerend father, make my person yours,
1156   And tell me how you would bestow your selfe?
1157   This royall hand and mine are newly knit,
1158   And the coniunction of our inward soules
1159   Married in league, coupled, and link'd together
1160   With all religous strength of sacred vowes,
1161   The latest breath that gaue the sound of words
1162   Was deepe- sworne faith, peace, amity, true loue
1163   Betweene our kingdomes and our royall selues,
1164   And euen before this truce, but new before,
1165   No longer then we well could wash our hands,
1166   To clap this royall bargaine vp of peace,
1167   Heauen knowes they were besmear'd and ouer- staind
1168   With slaughters pencill; where reuenge did paint
1169   The fearefull difference of incensed kings:
1170   And shall these hands so lately purg'd of bloud?
1171   So newly ioyn'd in loue? so strong in both,
1172   Vnyoke this seysure, and this kinde regreete?
1173   Play fast and loose with faith? so iest with heauen,
1174   Make such vnconstant children of our selues
1175   As now againe to snatch our palme from palme:
1176   Vn- sweare faith sworne, and on the marriage bed
1177   Of smiling peace to march a bloody hoast,
1178   And make a ryot on the gentle brow
1179   Of true sincerity? O holy Sir
1180   My reuerend father, let it not be so;
1181   Out of your grace, deuise, ordaine, impose
1182   Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest
1183   To doe your pleasure, and continue friends.
1184   <S {Pand}.> All forme is formelesse, Order orderlesse,
1185   Saue what is opposite to {Englands} loue.
1186   Therefore to Armes, be Champion of our Church,
1187   Or let the Church our mother breathe her curse,
1188   A mothers curse, on her reuolting sonne:
1189   {France}, thou maist hold a serpent by the tongue,
1190   A cased Lion by the mortall paw,
1191   A fasting Tyger safer by the tooth,
1192   Then keepe in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
1193   <S {Fra}.> I may dis- ioyne my hand, but not my faith.
1194   <S {Pand}.> So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith,
1195   And like a ciuill warre setst oath to oath,
1196   Thy tongue against thy tongue. O let thy vow
1197   First made to heauen, first be to heauen perform'd,
1198   That is, to be the Champion of our Church,
1199   What since thou sworst, is sworne against thy selfe,
1200   And may not be performed by thy selfe,
1201   For that which thou hast sworne to doe amisse,
1202   Is not amisse when it is truely done:
1203   And being not done, where doing tends to #ill,
1204   The truth is then most done not doing it:
1205   The better Act of purposes mistooke,
1206   Is to mistake again, though indirect,
1207   Yet indirection thereby growes direct,
1208   And falshood, falshood cures, as fire cooles fire
1209   Within the scorched veines of one new burn'd:
1210   It is religion that doth make vowes kept,
1211   But thou hast sworne against religion:
1212   By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
1213   And mak'st an oath the suretie for thy truth,
1214   Against an oath the truth, thou art vnsure
1215   To sweare, sweares onely not to be forsworne,
1216   Else what a mockerie should it be to sweare?
1217   But thou dost sweare, onely to be forsworne,
1218   And most forsworne, to keepe what thou dost sweare,
1219   Therefore thy later vowes, against thy first,
1220   Is in thy selfe rebellion to thy selfe:
1221   And better conquest neuer canst thou make,
1222   Then arme thy constant and thy nobler parts
1223   Against these giddy loose suggestions:
1224   Vpon which better part, our prayrs come in,
1225   If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
1226   The perill of our curses light on thee
1227   So heauy, as thou shalt not shake them off
1228   But in despaire, dye vnder their blacke weight.
1229   <S {Aust}.> Rebellion, flat rebellion.
1230   <S {Bast}.> #Wil't not be?
1231   Will not a Calues- skin stop that mouth of thine?
1232   <S {Daul}.> Father, to Armes.
1233   <S {Blanch}.> Vpon thy wedding day?
1234   Against the blood that thou hast married?
1235   What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
1236   Shall braying trumpets, and loud churlish drums
1237   Clamors of #hell, be measures to our pomp?
1238   O husband heare me: aye, alacke, how new
1239   Is husband in my mouth? euen for that name
1240   Which till this time my tongue did nere pronounce;
1241   Vpon my knee I beg, goe not to Armes
1242   Against mine Vncle.
1243   <S {Const}.> O, vpon my knee made hard with kneeling,
1244   I doe pray to thee, thou vertuous {Daulphin},
1245   Alter not the doome fore- thought by heauen.
1246   <S {Blan}.> Now shall I see thy loue, what motiue may
1247   Be stronger with thee, then the name of wife?
1248   <S {Con}.> That which vpholdeth him, that thee vpholds,
1249   His Honor, Oh thine Honor, {Lewis} thine Honor.
1250   <S {Dolph}.> I muse your Maiesty doth seeme so cold,
1251   When such profound respects doe pull you on?
1252   <S {Pand}.> I will denounce a curse vpon his head.
1253  *<S {Fra}.> Thou shalt not need. {England}, I will fall fro[m] thee.
1254   <S {Const}.> O faire returne of banish'd Maiestie.
1255   <S {Elea}.> O foule reuolt of French inconstancy.
1256  *<S {Eng}.> {France}, y shalt rue this houre within this houre.
      <P a6>
1257  *<S {Bast}.> Old Time the clocke setter, y bald sexton Time:
1258   Is it as he will? well then, {France} shall rue.
1259   <S {Bla}.> The Sun's orecast with bloud: faire day adieu,
1260   Which is the side that I must goe withall?
1261   I am with both, each Army hath a hand,
1262   And in their rage, I hauing hold of both,
1263   They whurle a- sunder, and dismember mee.
1264   Husband, I cannot pray that thou maist winne:
1265   Vncle, I needs must pray that thou maist lose:
1266   Father, I may not wish the fortune thine:
1267   Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thriue:
1268   Who- euer wins, on that side shall I lose:
1269   Assured losse, before the match be plaid.
1270   <S {Dolph}.> Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
1271  *<S {Bla}.> There where my fortune liues, there my life dies.
1272   <S {Iohn}.> {Cosen}, goe draw our puisance together,
1273   {France}, I am burn'd vp with inflaming wrath,
1274   A rage, whose heat hath this condition;
1275   That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
1276   The blood and deerest valued bloud of {France}.
1277  *<S {Fra}.> Thy rage shall burne thee vp, & thou shalt turne
1278   To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:
1279   Looke to thy selfe, thou art in ieopardie.
1280  *<S {Iohn}.> No more then he that threats. To Arms let's hie.

1286   Some ayery Deuill houers in the skie,
1287   And pour's downe mischiefe. {Austrias} head lye there,
1288   <D {Enter Iohn, Arthur, Hubert}.>
1289   While {Philip} breathes.
1290   <S {Iohn}.> {Hubert}, keepe this boy: {Philip} make vp,
1291   My Mother is assayled in our Tent,
1292   And tane I feare.
1293   <S {Bast}.> My Lord I rescued her,
1294   Her Highnesse is in safety, feare you not:
1295   But on my Liege, for very little paines
1296   Will bring this labor to an happy end.  <D {Exit}.>
1297  *<D {Alarums, excursions, Retreat. Enter Iohn, Eleanor, Arthur}

1300   So strongly guarded: Cosen, looke not sad,
1301   Thy Grandame loues thee, and thy Vnkle will
1302   As deere be to thee, as thy father was.
1303   <S {Arth}.> O this will make my mother die with griefe.
1304   <S {Iohn}.> Cosen away for {England}, haste before,
1305   And ere our comming see thou shake the bags
1306   Of hoording Abbots, imprisoned angells
1307   Set at libertie: the fat ribs of peace
1308   Must by the hungry now be fed vpon:
1309   Vse our Commission in his vtmost force.
1310  *<S {Bast}.> Bell, Booke, & Candle, shall not driue me back,
1311   When gold and siluer becks me to come on.
1312   I leaue your highnesse: Grandame, I will pray
1313   (If euer I remember to be holy)
1314   For your faire safety: so I kisse your hand.
1315   <S {Ele}.> Farewell gentle Cosen.
1316   <S {Iohn}.> Coz, farewell.
1317   <S {Ele}.> Come hether little kinsman, harke, a worde.
1318   <S {Iohn}.> Come hether {Hubert}. O my gentle {Hubert},
1319   We owe thee much: within this wall of flesh
1320   There is a soule counts thee  her Creditor,
1321   And with aduantage meanes to pay thy loue:
1322   And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
1323   Liues in this bosome, deerely cherished.
1324   Giue me thy hand, I had a thing to say,
1325   But I will fit it with some better tune.
1326   By heauen {Hubert}, I am almost asham'd
1327   To say what good respect I haue of thee.
1328   <S {Hub}.> I am much bounden to your Maiesty.
1329   <S {Iohn}.> Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
1330   But thou shalt haue: and creepe time nere so slow,
1331   Yet it shall come, for me to doe thee good.
1332   I had a thing to say, but let it goe:
1333   The Sunne is in the heauen, and the proud day,
1334   Attended with the pleasures of the world,
1335   Is all too wanton, and too full of  gawdes
1336   To giue me audience: If the mid- night bell
1337   Did with his yron tongue, and brazen mouth
1338   Sound on into the drowzie race of night:
1339   If this same were a Church- yard where we stand,
1340   And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs:
1341   Or if that surly spirit melancholy
1342   Had bak'd thy bloud, and made it heauy, thicke,
1343   Which else runnes tickling vp and downe the veines,
1344   Making that idiot laughter keepe mens eyes,
1345   And straine their cheekes to idle merriment,
1346   A passion hatefull to my purposes:
1347   Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
1348   Heare me without thine eares, and make reply
1349   Without a tongue, vsing conceit alone,
1350   Without eyes, eares, and harmefull sound of words:
1351   Then, in despight of brooded watchfull day,
1352   I would into thy bosome poure my thoughts:
1353   But (ah) I will not, yet I loue thee well,
1354   And by my troth I thinke thou lou'st me well.
1355   <S {Hub}.> So well, that what you bid me vndertake,
1356   Though that my death were adiunct to my Act,
1357   By  heauen I would doe it.
1358   <S {Iohn}.> Doe not I know thou wouldst?
1359   Good {Hubert}, {Hubert}, {Hubert} throw thine eye
1360   On yon young boy: Ile tell thee what my friend,
1361   He is a very serpent in my way,
1362   And wheresoere this foot of mine doth tread,
1363   He lies before me: dost thou vnderstand me?
1364   Thou art his keeper.
1365   <S {Hub}.> And Ile keepe him so,
1366   That he shall not offend your Maiesty.
1367   <S {Iohn}.> Death.
1368   <S {Hub}.> My Lord.
1369   <S {Iohn}.> A Graue.
1370   <S {Hub}.> He shall not liue.
1371   <S {Iohn}.> Enough.
1372   I could be merry now, {Hubert}, I loue thee.
1373   Well, Ile not say what I intend for thee:
1374   Remember: Madam, Fare you well,
1375   Ile send those powers o're to your Maiesty.
1376   <S {Ele}.> My blessing goe with thee.
1377   <S {Iohn}.> For {England} Cosen, goe.
1378   {#Hubert} shall be your man, attend on you
1379   With al true duetie: On toward {Callice}, hoa.
1380   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P a6v>
1381   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1382   <D {Enter France, Dolphin, Pandulpho, Attendants}.>
1383   <S {Fra}.> So by a roaring Tempest on the flood,
1384   A whole Armado of conuicted saile
1385   Is scattered and dis- ioyn'd from fellowship.
1386   <S {Pand}.> Courage and comfort, all shall yet goe well.
1387   <S {Fra}.> What can goe well, when we haue runne so #ill?
1388   Are we not beaten? Is not {Angiers} lost?
1389   {#Arthur} tane prisoner? diuers deere friends slaine?
1390   And bloudy {England} into {England} gone,
1391   Ore- bearing interruption spight of {France}?
1392   <S {Dol}.> What he hath won, that hath he fortified:
1393   So hot a speed, with such aduice dispos'd,
1394   Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
1395   Doth want example: who hath read, or heard
1396   Of any kindred- action like to this?
1397   <S {Fra}.> Well could I beare that {England} had this praise,
1398   So we could finde some patterne of our shame:
1399   <D {Enter Constance}.>
1400   Looke who comes heere? a graue vnto a soule,
1401   Holding th' eternall spirit against her #will,
1402   In the vilde prison of afflicted breath:
1403   I prethee Lady goe away with me.
1404   <S {Con}.> Lo; now: now see the issue of your peace.
1405   <S {Fra}.> Patience good Lady, comfort gentle {Constance}.
1406   <S {Con}.> No, I defie all Counsell, all redresse,
1407   But that which ends all counsell, true Redresse:
1408   Death, death, O amiable, louely death,
1409   Thou odoriferous stench: sound rottennesse,
1410   Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
1411   Thou hate and terror to prosperitie,
1412   And I will kisse  thy detestable bones,
1413   And put my eye- balls in thy vaultie browes,
1414   And ring these fingers with thy houshold wormes,
1415   And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
1416   And be a Carrion Monster like thy selfe;
1417   Come, grin on me, and I will thinke thou smil'st,
1418   And busse thee as thy wife: Miseries Loue,
1419   O come to me.
1420   <S {Fra}.> O faire affliction, peace.
1421   <S {Con}.> No, no, I will not, hauing breath to cry:
1422   O that my tongue were in the thunders mouth,
1423   Then with a passion would I shake the world,
1424   And rowze from sleepe that fell Anatomy
1425   Which cannot heare a Ladies feeble voyce,
1426   Which scornes a moderne Inuocation.
1427   <S {Pand}.> Lady, you vtter madnesse, and not sorrow.
1428   <S {Con}.> Thou art holy to belye me so,
1429   I am not mad: this haire I teare is mine,
1430   My name is {Constance}, I was {Geffreyes} wife,
1431   Yong {Arthur} is my sonne, and he is lost:
1432   I am not mad, I would to heauen I were,
1433   For then 'tis like I should forget my selfe:
1434   O, if I could, what griefe should I forget?
1435   Preach some Philosophy to make me mad,
1436   And thou shalt be Canoniz'd (Cardinall.)
1437   For, being not mad, but sensible of greefe,
1438   My reasonable part produces reason
1439   How I may be deliuer'd of these woes.
1440   And teaches mee to kill or hang my selfe:
1441   If I were mad, I should forget my sonne,
1442   Or madly thinke a babe of clowts were he;
1443   I am not mad: too well, too well I feele
1444   The different plague of each calamitie.
1445   <S {Fra}.> Binde vp those tresses: O what loue I note
1446   In the faire multitude of those her haires;
1447   Where but by chance a siluer drop hath falne,
1448   Euen to that drop ten thousand wiery fiends
1449   Doe glew themselues in sociable griefe,
1450   Like true, inseparable, faithfull loues,
1451   Sticking together in calamitie.
1452   <S {Con}.> To {England}, if you will.
1453   <S {Fra}.> Binde vp your haires.
1454   <S {Con}.> Yes that I will: and wherefore will I do it?
1455   I tore them from their bonds, and cride aloud,
1456   O, that these hands could so redeeme my sonne,
1457   As they haue giuen these hayres their libertie:
1458   But now I enuie at their libertie,
1459   And will againe commit them to their bonds,
1460   Because my poore childe is a prisoner.
1461   And Father Cardinall, I haue heard you say
1462   That we shall see and know our friends in heauen:
1463   If that be true, I shall see my boy againe;
1464   For since the birth of {Caine}, the first male- childe
1465   To him that did but yesterday suspire,
1466   There was not such a gracious creature borne:
1467   But now will Canker- sorrow eat my bud,
1468   And chase the natiue beauty from his cheeke,
1469   And he will looke as hollow as a Ghost,
1470   As dim and meager as an Agues fitte,
1471   And so hee'll dye: and rising so againe,
1472   When I shall meet him in the Court of heauen
1473   I shall not know him: therefore neuer, neuer
1474   Must I behold my pretty {Arthur} more.
1475   <S {Pand}.> You hold too heynous a respect of greefe.
1476   <S {Const}.> He talkes to me, that neuer had a sonne.
1477   <S {Fra}.> You are as fond of greefe, as of your childe.
1478   <S {Con}.> Greefe fils the roome vp of my absent childe:
1479   Lies in his bed, walkes vp and downe with me,
1480   Puts on his pretty lookes, repeats his words,
1481   Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
1482   Stuffes out his vacant garments with his forme;
1483   Then, haue I reason to be fond of griefe?
1484   Fareyouwell: had you such a losse as I,
1485   I could giue better comfort then you doe.
1486   I will not keepe this forme vpon my head,
1487   When there is such disorder in my witte:
1488   O Lord, my boy, my {Arthur}, my faire sonne,
1489   My life, my ioy, my food, my all the world:
1490   My widow- comfort, and my sorrowes cure.  <D {Exit}.>
1491  *<S {Fra}.> I feare some out- rage, and Ile follow her.  <D {Exit}.>
1492  *<S {Dol}.> There's nothing in this world can make me ioy,
1493   Life is as tedious as a twice- told tale,
1494   Vexing the dull eare of a drowsie man;
1495   And bitter shame hath spoyl'd the sweet words taste,
1496   That it yeelds nought but shame and bitternesse.
1497   <S {Pand}.> Before the curing of a strong disease,
1498   Euen in the instant of repaire and health,
1499   The fit is strongest: Euils that take leaue
1500   On their departure, most of all shew euill:
1501   What haue you lost by losing of this day?
1502   <S {Dol}.> All daies of glory, ioy,  and happinesse.
1503   <S {Pan}.> If you had won it, certainely you had.
1504   No, no: when Fortune meanes to men most good,
1505   Shee lookes vpon them with a threatning eye:
1506   'Tis strange to thinke how much King {Iohn} hath lost
1507   In this which he accounts so clearely wonne:
      <P b1><C B>
1508   Are not you grieu'd that {Arthur} is his prisoner?
1509   <S {Dol}.> As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
1510   <S {Pan}.> Your minde is all as youthfull as your blood.
1511   Now heare me speake with a propheticke spirit:
1512   For euen the breath of what I meane to speake,
1513   Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub
1514   Out of the path which shall directly lead
1515  *Thy foote to Englands Throne. And therefore marke:
1516   {#Iohn} hath seiz'd {Arthur}, and it cannot be,
1517   That whiles warme life playes in that infants veines,
1518   The mis- plac'd-{#Iohn} should entertaine an houre,
1519   One minute, nay one quiet breath of rest.
1520   A Scepter snatch'd with an vnruly hand,
1521   Must be as boysterously maintain'd as gain'd.
1522   And he that stands vpon a slipp'ry place,
1523   Makes nice of no vilde hold to stay him vp:
1524   That {Iohn} may stand, then {Arthur} needs must fall,
1525   So be it, for it cannot be but so.
1526   <S {Dol}.> But what shall I gaine by yong {Arthurs} fall?
1527   <S {Pan}.> You, in the right of Lady {Blanch} your wife,
1528   May then make all the claime that {Arthur} did.
1529   <S {Dol}.> And loose it, life and all, as {Arthur} did.
1530  *<S {Pan}.> How green you are, and fresh in this old world?
1531   {#Iohn} layes you plots: the times conspire with you,
1532   For he that steepes his safetie in true blood,
1533   Shall finde but bloodie safety, and vntrue.
1534   This Act so euilly borne shall coole the hearts
1535   Of all his people, and freeze vp their zeale,
1536   That none so small aduantage shall step forth
1537   To checke his reigne, but they will cherish it.
1538   No naturall exhalation in the skie,
1539   No scope of Nature, no distemper'd day,
1540   No common winde, no customed euent,
1541   But they will plucke away his naturall cause,
1542   And call them Meteors, prodigies, and signes,
1543   Abbortiues, presages, and tongues of heauen,
1544   Plainly denouncing vengeance vpon {Iohn}.
1545   <S {Dol}.> May be he will not touch yong {Arthurs} life,
1546   But hold himselfe safe in his prisonment.
1547   <S {Pan}.> O Sir, when he shall heare of your approach,
1548   If that yong {Arthur} be not gone alreadie,
1549   Euen at that newes he dies: and then the hearts
1550   Of all his people shall reuolt from him,
1551   And kisse the lippes of vnacquainted change,
1552   And picke strong matter of reuolt, and wrath
1553   Out of the bloody fingers ends of {Iohn}.
1554   Me thinkes I see this hurley all on foot;
1555   And O, what better matter breeds for you,
1556   Then I haue nam'd. The Bastard {Falconbridge}
1557   Is now in England ransacking the Church,
1558   Offending Charity: If but a dozen French
1559   Were there in Armes, they would be as a Call
1560   To traine ten thousand English to their side;
1561   Or, as a little snow, tumbled about,
1562   Anon becomes a Mountaine. O noble Dolphine,
1563   Go with me to the King, 'tis wonderfull,
1564   What may be wrought out of their discontent,
1565   Now that their soules are topfull of offence,
1566   For England go; I will whet on the King.
1567  *<S {Dol}.> Strong reasons makes strange actions: let vs go,
1568   If you say #I, the King will not say no.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1569   <Z {Actus Quartus, Scaena prima}.>
1570   <D {Enter Hubert and Executioners}.>
1571  *<S {Hub}.> Heate me these Irons hot, and looke thou stand
1572   Within the Arras: when I strike my foot
1573   Vpon the bosome of the ground, rush forth
1574   And binde the boy, which you shall finde with me
1575   Fast to the chaire: be heedfull: hence, and watch.
1576   <S {Exec}.> I hope your warrant will beare out the deed.
1577  *<S {Hub}.> Vncleanly scruples feare not you: looke too't.
1578   Yong Lad come forth; I haue to say with you.
1579   <D {Enter Arthur}.>
1580   <S {Ar}.> Good morrow {Hubert}.
1581   <S {Hub}.> Good morrow, little Prince.
1582   <S {Ar}.> As little Prince, hauing so great a Title
1583   To be more Prince, as may be: you are sad.
1584   <S {Hub}.> Indeed I haue beene merrier.
1585   <S {Art}.> 'Mercie on me:
1586   Me thinkes no body should be sad but I:
1587   Yet I remember, when I was in France,
1588   Yong Gentlemen would be as sad as night
1589   Onely for wantonnesse: by my Christendome,
1590   So I were out of prison, and kept Sheepe
1591   I should be as merry as the day is long:
1592   And so I would be heere, but that I doubt
1593   My Vnckle practises more harme to me:
1594   He is affraid of me, and I of him:
1595   Is it my fault, that I was {Geffreyes} sonne?
1596   No in deede is't not: and I would to heauen
1597   I were your sonne, so you would loue me, Hubert:
1598   <S {Hub}.> If I talke to him, with his innocent prate
1599   He will awake my mercie, which lies dead:
1600   Therefore I will be sodaine, and dispatch.
1601   <S {Ar}.> Are you sicke Hubert? you looke pale to day,
1602   Insooth I would you were a little sicke,
1603   That I might sit all night, and watch with you.
1604   I warrant I loue you more then you do me.
1605   <S {Hub}.> His words do take possession of my bosome.
1606  *Reade heere yong {Arthur}. How now foolish rheume?
1607   Turning dispitious torture out of doore?
1608   I must be breefe, least resolution drop
1609   Out at mine eyes, in tender womanish teares.
1610   Can you not reade it? Is it not faire writ?
1611   <S {Ar}.> Too fairely {Hubert}, for so foule effect,
1612   Must you with hot Irons, burne out both mine eyes?
1613   <S {Hub}.> Yong Boy, I must.
1614   <S {Art}.> And will you?
1615   <S {Hub}.> And I will.
1616   <S {Art}.> Haue you the heart? When your head did but
1617   ake,
1618   I knit my hand- kercher about your browes
1619   (The best I had, a Princesse wrought it me)
1620   And I did neuer aske it you againe:
1621   And with my hand, at midnight held your head;
1622   And like the watchfull minutes, to the houre,
1623   Still and anon cheer'd vp the heauy time;
1624   Saying, what lacke you? and where lies your greefe?
1625   Or what good loue may I performe for you?
1626   Many a poore mans sonne would haue lyen still,
1627   And nere haue spoke a louing word to you:
1628   But you, at your sicke seruice had a Prince:
1629   Nay, you may thinke my loue was craftie loue,
1630   And call it cunning. Do, and if you will,
      <P b1v>
1631   If heauen be pleas'd that you must vse me #ill,
1632   Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
1633   These eyes, that neuer did, nor neuer shall
1634   So much as frowne on you.
1635   <S {Hub}.> I haue sworne to do it:
1636   And with hot Irons must I burne them out.
1637   <S {Ar}.> Ah, none but in this Iron Age, would do it:
1638   The Iron of it selfe, though heate red hot,
1639  *Approaching neere these eyes, would drinke my teares,
1640   And quench this fierie indignation,
1641   Euen in the matter of mine innocence:
1642   Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
1643   But for containing fire to harme mine eye:
1644   Are you more stubborne hard, then hammer'd Iron?
1645   And if an Angell should haue come to me,
1646   And told me {Hubert} should put out mine eyes,
1647  *I would not haue beleeu'd him: no tongue but {Huberts}.
1648   <S {Hub}.> Come forth: Do as I bid you do.
1649   <S {Art}.> O saue me {Hubert}, saue me: my eyes are out
1650   Euen with the fierce lookes of these bloody men.
1651   <S {Hub}.> Giue me the Iron I say, and binde him heere.
1652   <S {Art}.> Alas, what neede you be so boistrous rough?
1653   I will not struggle, I will stand stone still:
1654   For heauen sake {Hubert} let me not be bound:
1655   Nay heare me {Hubert}, driue these men away,
1656   And I will sit as quiet as a Lambe.
1657   I will not stirre, nor winch, nor speake a word,
1658   Nor looke vpon the Iron angerly:
1659   Thrust but these men away, and Ile forgiue you,
1660   What euer torment you do put me #too.
1661   <S {Hub}.> Go stand within: let me alone with him.
1662   <S {Exec}.> I am best pleas'd to be from such a deede.
1663   <S {Art}.> Alas, I then haue chid away my friend,
1664   He hath a sterne looke, but a gentle heart:
1665   Let him come backe, that his compassion may
1666   Giue life to yours.
1667   <S {Hub}.> Come (Boy) prepare your selfe.
1668   <S {Art}.> Is there no remedie?
1669   <S {Hub}.> None, but to lose your eyes.
1670   <S {Art}.> O heauen: that there were but a moth in yours,
1671   A graine, a dust, a gnat, a wandering haire,
1672   Any annoyance in that precious sense:
1673   Then feeling what small things are boysterous there,
1674   Your vilde intent must needs seeme horrible.
1675  *<S {Hub}.> Is this your promise? Go #too,  hold your toong.
1676   <S {Art}.> {Hubert}, the vtterance of a brace of tongues,
1677   Must needes want pleading for a paire of eyes:
1678   Let me not hold my tongue: let me not {Hubert},
1679   Or {Hubert}, if you will cut out my tongue,
1680   So I may keepe mine eyes. O spare mine eyes,
1681   Though to no vse, but still to looke on you.
1682   Loe, by my troth, the Instrument is cold,
1683   And would not harme me.
1684   <S {Hub}.> I can heate it, Boy.
1685  *<S {Art}.> No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with griefe,
1686   Being create for comfort, to be vs'd
1687   In vndeserued extreames: See else your selfe,
1688   There is no malice in this burning cole,
1689   The breath of heauen, hath blowne his spirit out,
1690   And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.
1691   <S {Hub}.> But with my breath I can reuiue it Boy.
1692   <S {Art}.> #And if you do, you will but make it blush,
1693   And glow with shame of your proceedings, {Hubert}:
1694   Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes:
1695   And, like a dogge that is compell'd to fight,
1696   Snatch at his Master that doth tarre him on.
1697   All things that you should vse to do me wrong
1698   Deny their office: onely you do lacke
1699   That mercie, which fierce fire, and Iron extends,
1700   Creatures of note for mercy, lacking vses.
1701   <S {Hub}.> Well, see to liue: I will not touch thine eye,
1702   For all the Treasure that thine Vnckle owes,
1703   Yet am I sworne, and I did purpose, Boy,
1704   With this same very Iron, to burne them out.
1705   <S {Art}.> O now you looke like {Hubert}. All this while
1706   You were disguis'd.
1707   <S {Hub}.> Peace: no more. Adieu,
1708   Your Vnckle must not know but you are dead.
1709   Ile fill these dogged Spies with false reports:
1710   And, pretty childe, sleepe doubtlesse, and secure,
1711   That {Hubert} for the wealth of all the world,
1712   Will not offend thee.
1713   <S {Art}.> O heauen! I thanke you {Hubert}.
1714   <S {Hub}.> Silence, no more; go closely in with mee,
1715   Much danger do I vndergo for thee.  <D {Exeunt}>
1716   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1717   <D {Enter Iohn, Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lordes}.>
1718  *<S {Iohn}.> Heere once againe we sit: once against crown'd
1719   And look'd vpon, I hope, with chearefull eyes.
1720  *<S {Pem}.> This once again (but that your Highnes pleas'd)
1721   Was once superfluous: you were Crown'd before,
1722   And that high Royalty was nere pluck'd off:
1723   The faiths of men, nere stained with reuolt:
1724   Fresh expectation troubled not the Land
1725   With any long'd- for- change, or better State.
1726   <S {Sal}.> Therefore, to be possess'd with double pompe,
1727   To guard a Title, that was rich before;
1728   To gilde refined Gold, to paint the Lilly;
1729   To throw a perfume on the Violet,
1730   To smooth the yce, or adde another hew
1731   Vnto the Raine- bow; or with Taper- light
1732   To seeke the beauteous eye of heauen to garnish,
1733   Is wastefull, and ridiculous excesse.
1734   <S {Pem}.> But that your Royall pleasure must be done,
1735   This acte, is as an ancient tale new told,
1736   And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
1737   Being vrged at a time vnseasonable.
1738   <S {Sal}.> In this the Anticke, and well noted face
1739   Of plaine old forme, is much disfigured,
1740   And like a shifted winde vnto a saile,
1741   It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
1742   Startles, and frights consideration:
1743   Makes sound opinion sicke, and truth suspected,
1744   For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
1745  *<S {Pem}.> When Workemen striue to do better then wel,
1746   They do confound their skill in couetousnesse,
1747   And oftentimes excusing of a fault,
1748   Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse:
1749   As patches set vpon a little breach,
1750   Discredite more in hiding of the fault,
1751   Then did the fault before it was so patch'd.
1752   <S {Sal}.> To this effect, before you were new crown'd
1753  *We breath'd our Councell: but it pleas'd your Highnes
1754   To ouer- beare it, and we are all well pleas'd,
1755   Since all, and euery part of what we would
1756   Doth make a stand, at what your Highnesse will.
      <P b2>
1757   <S {Ioh}.> Some reasons of this double Corronation
1758   I haue possest you with, and thinke them strong.
1759   And more, more strong, then lesser is my feare
1760   I shall indue you with: Meane time, but aske
1761   What you would haue reform'd, that is not well,
1762   And well shall you perceiue, how willingly
1763   I will both heare, and grant you your requests.
1764   <S {Pem}.> Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
1765   To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
1766   Both for my selfe, and them: but chiefe of all
1767   Your safety: for the which, my selfe and them
1768   Bend their best studies, heartily request
1769   Th' infranchisement  of {Arthur}, whose restraint
1770   Doth moue the murmuring lips of discontent
1771   To breake into this dangerous argument.
1772   If what in rest you haue, in right you hold,
1773   Why then your feares, which (as they say) attend
1774   The steppes of wrong, should moue you to mew vp
1775   Your tender kinsman, and to choake his dayes
1776   With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
1777   The rich aduantage of good exercise,
1778   That the times enemies may not haue this
1779   To grace occasions: let it be our suite,
1780   That you haue bid vs aske his libertie,
1781   Which for our goods, we do no further aske,
1782   Then, whereupon our weale on you depending,
1783   Counts it your weale: he haue his liberty.
1784   <D {Enter Hubert}.>
1785   <S {Iohn}.> Let it be so: I do commit his youth
1786   To your direction: {Hubert}, what newes with you?
1787   <S {Pem}.> This is the man should do the bloody deed:
1788   He shew'd his warrant to a friend of mine,
1789   The image of a wicked heynous fault
1790   Liues in his eye: that close aspect of his,
1791   Do shew the mood of a much troubled brest,
1792   And I do fearefully beleeue 'tis done,
1793   What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
1794   <S {Sal}.> The colour of the King doth come, and go
1795   Betweene his purpose and his conscience,
1796   Like Heralds 'twixt two dreadfull battailes set:
1797   His passion is so ripe, it needs must breake.
1798   <S {Pem}.> And when it breakes, I feare will issue thence
1799   The foule corruption of a sweet childes death.
1800   <S {Iohn}.> We cannot hold mortalities strong hand.
1801   Good Lords, although my #will to giue, is liuing,
1802   The suite which you demand is gone, and dead.
1803   He tels vs {Arthur} is deceas'd to night.
1804   <S {Sal}.> Indeed we fear'd his sicknesse was past cure.
1805   <S {Pem}.> Indeed we heard how neere his death he was,
1806   Before the childe himselfe felt he was sicke:
1807   This must be answer'd either heere, or hence.
1808  *<S {Ioh}.> Why do you bend such solemne browes on me?
1809   Thinke you I beare the Sheeres of destiny?
1810   Haue I commandement on the pulse of life?
1811   <S {Sal}.> It is apparant foule- play, and 'tis shame
1812   That Greatnesse should so grossely offer it;
1813   So thriue it in your game, and so farewell.
1814   <S {Pem}.> Stay yet (Lord Salisbury) Ile go with thee,
1815   And finde th' inheritance  of this poore childe,
1816   His little kingdome of a forced graue.
1817   That blood which ow'd the bredth of all this #Ile,
1818   Three foot of it doth hold; bad world the while:
1819   This must not be thus borne, this will breake out
1820   To all our sorrowes, and ere long I doubt.  <D {Exeunt}>
1821   <S {Io}.> They burn in indignation: I repent:  <D {Enter Mes}.>
1822   There is no sure foundation set on blood:
1823   No certaine life atchieu'd by others death:
1824   A fearefull eye thou hast. Where is that blood,
1825   That I haue seene inhabite in those cheekes?
1826   So foule a skie, cleeres not without a storme,
1827   Poure downe thy weather: how goes all in France?
1828   <S {Mes}.> From France to England, neuer such a powre
1829   For any forraigne preparation,
1830   Was leuied in the body of a land.
1831   The Copie of your speede is learn'd by them:
1832   For when you should be told they do prepare,
1833   The tydings comes, that they are all arriu'd.
1834   <S {Ioh}.> Oh where hath our Intelligence bin drunke?
1835   Where hath it slept? Where is my Mothers care?
1836   That such an Army could be drawne in France,
1837   And she not heare of it?
1838   <S {Mes}.> My Liege, her eare
1839   Is stopt with dust: the first of Aprill #di'de
1840   Your noble mother; and as I heare, my Lord,
1841   The Lady {Constance} in a frenzie #di'de
1842   Three dayes before: but this from Rumors tongue
1843   I idely heard: if true, or false I know not.
1844   <S {Iohn}.> With- hold thy speed, dreadfull Occasion:
1845   O make a league with me, 'till I haue pleas'd
1846   My discontented Peeres. What? Mother dead?
1847   How wildely then walkes my Estate in France?
1848   Vnder whose conduct came those powres of France,
1849   That thou for truth giu'st out are landed heere?
1850   <S {Mes}.> Vnder the Dolphin.
1851   <D {Enter Bastard and Peter of Pomfret}.>
1852   <S {Ioh}.> Thou hast made me giddy
1853   With these #ill tydings: Now? What sayes the world
1854   To your proceedings? Do not seeke to stuffe
1855   My head with more #ill newes: for it is full.
1856   <S {Bast}.> But if you be a- feard to heare the worst,
1857   Then let the worst vn- heard, fall on your head.
1858   <S {Iohn}.> Beare with me Cosen, for I was amaz'd
1859   Vnder the tide; but now I breath againe
1860   Aloft the flood, and can giue audience
1861   To any tongue, speake it of what it will.
1862   <S {Bast}.> How I haue sped among the Clergy men,
1863   The summes I haue collected shall expresse:
1864   But as I trauail'd hither through the land,
1865   I finde the people strangely fantasied,
1866   Possest with rumors, full of idle dreames,
1867   Not knowing what they feare, but full of feare.
1868   And here's a Prophet that I brought with me
1869   From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
1870   With many hundreds treading on his heeles:
1871   To whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rimes,
1872   That ere the next Ascension day at noone,
1873   Your Highnes should deliuer vp your Crowne.
1874   <S {Iohn}.> Thou idle Dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
1875   <S {Pet}.> Fore- knowing that the truth will fall out so.
1876   <S {Iohn}.> {Hubert}, away with him: imprison him,
1877   And on that day at noone, whereon he sayes
1878   I shall yeeld vp my Crowne, let him be hang'd
1879   Deliuer him to safety, and returne,
1880   For I must vse thee. O my gentle Cosen,
1881   Hear'st thou the newes abroad, who are arriu'd?
1882  *<S {Bast}.> The {French} (my Lord) mens mouths are ful of it:
1883   Besides I met Lord {Bigot}, and Lord {Salisburie}
1884   With eyes as red as new enkindled fire,
1885   And others more, going to seeke the graue
1886   Of {Arthur}, whom they say is kill'd to night, on your |(suggestion.
1887   <S {Iohn}.> Gentle kinsman,  go
1888   And thrust thy selfe into their Companies,
      <P b2v>
1889   I haue a way to winne their loues againe:
1890   Bring them before me.
1891   <S {Bast}.> I will seeke them out.
1892   <S {Iohn}.> Nay, but make haste: the better foote before.
1893   O, let me haue no subiect enemies,
1894   When aduerse Forreyners affright my Townes
1895   With dreadfull pompe of stout inuasion.
1896   Be Mercurie, set feathers to thy heeles,
1897   And flye (like thought) from them, to me againe.
1898  *<S {Bast}.> The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.  <D {Exit}>
1899   <S {Iohn}.> Spoke like a sprightfull Noble Gentleman.
1900   Go after him: for he perhaps shall neede
1901   Some Messenger betwixt me, and the Peeres,
1902   And be thou hee.
1903   <S {Mes}.> With all my heart, my Liege.
1904   <S {Iohn}.> My mother dead?
1905   <D {Enter Hubert}.>
1906   <S {Hub}.> My Lord, they say fiue Moones were seene to |(night:
1907   Foure fixed, and the fift did whirle about
1908   The other foure, in wondrous motion.
1909   <S {Ioh}.> Fiue Moones?
1910   <S {Hub}.> Old men, and Beldames, in the streets
1911   Do prophesie vpon it dangerously:
1912   Yong {Arthurs} death is common in their mouths,
1913   And when they talke of him, they shake their heads,
1914   And whisper one another in the eare.
1915   And he that speakes, doth gripe the hearers wrist,
1916   Whilst he that heares, makes fearefull action
1917   With wrinkled browes, with nods, with rolling eyes.
1918   I saw a Smith stand with his hammer (thus)
1919   The whilst his Iron did on the Anuile coole,
1920   With open mouth swallowing a Taylors newes,
1921   Who with his Sheeres, and Measure in his hand,
1922   Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
1923   Had falsely thrust vpon contrary feete,
1924   Told of a many thousand warlike French,
1925   That were embattailed, and rank'd in Kent.
1926   Another leane, vnwash'd Artificer,
1927   Cuts off his tale, and talkes of {Arthurs} death.
1928  *<S {Io}.> Why seek'st thou to possesse me with these feares?
1929   Why vrgest thou so oft yong {Arthurs} death?
1930   Thy hand hath murdred him: I had a mighty cause
1931   To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
1932  *<S {H}.> No #had (my Lord?) why, did you not prouoke me?
1933   <S {Iohn}.> It is the curse of Kings, to be attended
1934   By slaues, that take their humors for a warrant,
1935   To breake within the bloody house of life,
1936   And on the winking of Authoritie
1937   To vnderstand a Law; to know the meaning
1938   Of dangerous Maiesty, when perchance it frownes
1939   More vpon humor, then aduis'd respect.
1940   <S {Hub}.> Heere is your hand and Seale for what I did.
1941  *<S {Ioh}.> Oh, when the last accompt twixt heauen & earth
1942   Is to be made, then shall this hand and Seale
1943   Witnesse against vs to damnation.
1944   How oft the sight of meanes to do #ill deeds,
1945   Make deeds #ill done? Had'st not thou beene by,
1946   A fellow by the hand of Nature mark'd,
1947   Quoted, and sign'd to do a deede of shame,
1948   This murther had not come into my minde.
1949   But taking note of thy abhorr'd Aspect,
1950   Finding thee fit for bloody villanie:
1951   Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
1952   I faintly broke with thee of {Arthurs} death:
1953   And thou, to be endeered to a King,
1954   Made it no conscience to destroy a Prince.
1955   <S {Hub}.> My Lord.
1956  *<S {Ioh}.> Had'st thou but shooke thy head, or made a pause
1957   When I spake darkely, what I purposed:
1958   Or turn'd an eye of doubt vpon my face;
1959   As bid me tell my tale in expresse words:
1960  *Deepe shame had struck me dumbe, made me break off,
1961  *And those thy feares, might haue wrought feares in me.
1962   But, thou didst vnderstand me by my signes,
1963   And didst in signes againe parley with sinne,
1964   Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
1965   And consequently, thy rude hand to acte
1966   The deed, which both our tongues held vilde to name.
1967   Out of my sight, and neuer see me more:
1968   My Nobles leaue me, and my State is braued,
1969   Euen at my gates, with rankes of forraigne powres;
1970   Nay, in the body of this fleshly Land,
1971   This kingdome, this Confine of blood, and breathe
1972   Hostilitie, and ciuill tumult reignes
1973   Betweene my conscience, and my Cosins death.
1974   <S {Hub}.> Arme you against your other enemies:
1975   Ile make a peace betweene your soule, and you.
1976   Yong {Arthur} is aliue: This hand of mine
1977   Is yet a maiden, and an innocent hand.
1978   Not painted with the Crimson spots of blood,
1979   Within this bosome, neuer entred yet
1980   The dreadfull motion of a murderous thought,
1981   And you haue slander'd Nature in my forme,
1982   Which howsoeuer rude exteriorly,
1983   Is yet the couer of a fayrer minde,
1984   Then to be butcher of an innocent childe.
1985   <S {Iohn}.> Doth {Arthur} liue? O #hast thee to the Peeres,
1986   Throw this report on their incensed rage,
1987   And make them tame to their obedience.
1988   Forgiue the Comment that my passion made
1989   Vpon thy feature, for my rage was blinde,
1990   And foule immaginarie eyes of blood
1991   Presented thee more hideous then thou art.
1992   Oh, answer not; but to my Closset bring
1993   The angry Lords, with all expedient #hast,
1994   I coniure thee but slowly: run more fast.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1995   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
1996   <D {Enter Arthur on the walles}.>
1997   <S {Ar}.> The Wall is high, and yet will I leape downe.
1998   Good ground be pittifull, and hurt me not:
1999   There's few or none do know me, if they did,
2000   This Ship- boyes semblance hath disguis'd me quite.
2001   I am afraide, and yet Ile venture it.
2002   If I get downe, and do not breake my limbes,
2003   Ile finde a thousand shifts to get away;
2004   As good to dye, and go; as dye, and stay.
2005   Oh me, my Vnckles spirit is in these stones,
2006  *Heauen take my soule, and England keep my bones.  <D {Dies}>
2007   <D {Enter Pembroke, Salisbury, & Bigot}.>
2008   <S {Sal}.> Lords, I will meet him at S[aint]. {Edmondsbury},
2009   It is our safetie, and we must embrace
2010   This gentle offer of the perillous time.
2011  *<S {Pem}.> Who brought that Letter from the Cardinall?
2012   <S {Sal}.> The Count {Meloone}, a Noble Lord of France,
2013   Whose priuate with me of the Dolphines loue,
2014   Is much more generall, then these lines import.
      <P b3>
2015   <S {Big}.> To morrow morning let vs meete him then.
2016   <S {Sal}.> Or rather then set forward, for 'twill be
2017   Two long dayes iourney (Lords) or ere we meete.
2018   <D {Enter Bastard}.>
2019  *<S {Bast}.> Once more to day well met, distemper'd Lords,
2020   The King by me requests your presence straight.
2021   <S {Sal}.> The king hath dispossest himselfe of vs,
2022   We will not lyne his thin- bestained cloake
2023   With our pure Honors: nor attend the foote
2024   That leaues the print of blood where ere it walkes.
2025   Returne, and tell him so: we know the worst.
2026   <S {Bast}.> What ere you thinke, good words I thinke
2027   were best.
2028   <S {Sal}.> Our greefes, and not our manners reason now.
2029   <S {Bast}.> But there is little reason in your greefe.
2030   Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
2031   <S {Pem}.> Sir, sir, impatience hath his priuiledge.
2032   <S {Bast}.> 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no mans else.
2033   <S {Sal}.> This is the prison: What is he lyes heere?
2034  *<S {P}.> Oh death, made proud with pure & princely beuty,
2035   The earth had not a hole to hide this deede.
2036   <S {Sal}.> Murther, as hating what himselfe hath done,
2037   Doth lay it open to vrge on reuenge.
2038   <S {Big}.> Or when he doom'd this Beautie to a graue,
2039   Found it too precious Princely, for a graue.
2040  *<S {Sal}.> Sir {Richard}, what thinke you? you haue beheld,
2041   Or haue you read, or heard, or could you thinke?
2042   Or do you almost thinke, although you see,
2043   That you do see? Could thought, without this obiect
2044   Forme such another? This is the very top,
2045   The heighth, the Crest: or Crest vnto the Crest
2046   Of murthers Armes: This is the bloodiest shame,
2047   The wildest Sauagery, the vildest stroke
2048   That euer wall- ey'd wrath, or staring rage
2049   Presented to the teares of soft remorse.
2050   <S {Pem}.> All murthers past, do stand excus'd in this:
2051   And this so sole, and so vnmatcheable,
2052   Shall giue a holinesse, a puritie,
2053   To the yet vnbegotten sinne of times;
2054   And proue a deadly blood-shed, but a iest,
2055   Exampled by this heynous spectacle.
2056   <S {Bast}.> It is a damned, and a bloody worke,
2057   The gracelesse action of a heauy hand,
2058   If that it be the worke of any hand.
2059   <S {Sal}.> If that it be the worke of any hand?
2060   We had a kinde of light, what would ensue:
2061   It is the shamefull worke of {Huberts} hand,
2062   The practice, and the purpose of the king:
2063   From whose obedience I forbid my soule,
2064   Kneeling before this ruine of sweete life,
2065   And breathing to his breathlesse Excellence
2066   The Incense of a Vow, a holy Vow:
2067   Neuer to taste the pleasures of the world,
2068   Neuer to be infected with delight,
2069   Nor conuersant with Ease, and Idlenesse,
2070   Till I haue set a glory to this hand,
2071   By giuing it the worship of Reuenge.
2072  *<S {Pem}. {Big}.> Our soules religiously confirme thy words.
2073   <D {Enter Hubert}.>
2074   <S {Hub}.> Lords, I am hot with haste, in seeking you,
2075   {#Arthur} doth liue, the king hath sent for you.
2076   <S {Sal}.> Oh he is bold, and blushes not at death,
2077   Auant thou hatefull villain, get thee gone.
2078   <S {Hu}.> I am no villaine.  <S {Sal}.> Must I rob |(the Law?
2079   <S {Bast}.> Your sword is bright sir, put it vp againe.
2080   <S {Sal}.> Not till I sheath it in a murtherers skin.
2081   <S {Hub}.> Stand backe Lord Salsbury, stand backe I say
2082   By heauen, I thinke my sword's as sharpe as yours.
2083   I would not haue you (Lord) forget your selfe,
2084   Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
2085   Least I, by marking of your rage, forget
2086   Your Worth, your Greatnesse, and Nobility.
2087  *<S {Big}.> Out dunghill: dar'st thou braue a Nobleman?
2088   <S {Hub}.> Not for my life: But yet I dare defend
2089   My innocent life against an Emperor.
2090   <S {Sal}.> Thou art a Murtherer.
2091   <S {Hub}.> Do not proue me so:
2092   Yet I am none. Whose tongue so ere speakes false,
2093   Not truely speakes: who speakes not truly, Lies.
2094   <S {Pem}.> Cut him to peeces.
2095   <S {Bast}.> Keepe the peace, I say.
2096   <S {Sal}.> Stand by, or I shall gaul you {Faulconbridge}.
2097   <S {Bast}.> Thou wer't better gaul the diuell Salsbury.
2098   If thou but frowne on me, or stirre thy foote,
2099   Or teach thy hastie spleene to do me shame,
2100   Ile strike thee dead. Put vp thy sword betime,
2101   Or Ile so maule you, and your tosting- Iron,
2102   That you shall thinke the diuell is come from #hell.
2103   <S {Big}.> What wilt thou do, renowned {Faulconbridge}?
2104   Second a Villaine, and a Murtherer?
2105   <S {Hub}.> Lord {Bigot}, I am none.
2106   <S {Big}.> Who kill'd this Prince?
2107   <S {Hub}.> 'Tis not an houre since I left him well:
2108   I honour'd him, I lou'd him, and will weepe
2109   My date of life out, for his sweete liues losse.
2110   <S {Sal}.> Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
2111   For villanie is not without such rheume,
2112   And he, long traded in it, makes it seeme
2113   Like Riuers of remorse and innocencie.
2114   Away with me, all you whose soules abhorre
2115   Th' vncleanly sauours of a Slaughter- house,
2116   For I am stifled with this smell of sinne.
2117   <S {Big}.> Away, toward {Burie}, to the Dolphin there.
2118  *<S {P}.> There tel the king, he may inquire vs out.  <D {Ex}. {Lords}.>
2119  *<S {Ba}.> Here's a good world: knew you of this faire work?
2120   Beyond the infinite and boundlesse reach of mercie,
2121   (If thou didst this deed of death) art y damn'd {Hubert}.
2122   <S {Hub}.> Do but heare me sir.
2123   <S {Bast}.> Ha? Ile tell thee what.
2124   Thou'rt damn'd as blacke, nay nothing is so blacke,
2125   Thou art more deepe damn'd then Prince Lucifer:
2126   There is not yet so vgly a fiend of #hell
2127   As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this childe.
2128   <S {Hub}.> Vpon my soule.
2129   <S {Bast}.> If thou didst but consent
2130   To this most cruell Act: do but dispaire,
2131   And if thou want'st a Cord, the smallest thred
2132   That euer Spider twisted from her wombe
2133   Will serue to strangle thee: A rush will be a beame
2134   To hang thee on. Or wouldst thou drowne thy selfe,
2135   Put but a little water in a spoone,
2136   And it shall be as all the Ocean,
2137   Enough to stifle such a villaine vp.
2138   I do suspect thee very greeuously.
2139   <S {Hub}.> If I in act, consent, or sinne of thought,
2140   Be guiltie of the stealing that sweete breath
2141   Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
2142   Let #hell want paines enough to torture me:
2143   I left him well.
2144   <S {Bast}.> Go, beare him in thine armes:
2145   I am amaz'd me thinkes, and loose my way
2146   Among the thornes, and dangers of this world.
      <P b3v><C C>
2147   How easie dost thou take all {England} vp,
2148   From forth this morcell of dead Royaltie?
2149   The life, the right, and truth of all this Realme
2150   Is fled to heauen: and {England} now is left
2151   To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth
2152   The vn- owed interest of proud swelling State:
2153   Now for the bare- pickt bone of Maiesty,
2154   Doth dogged warre bristle his angry crest,
2155   And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
2156   Now Powers from home, and discontents at home
2157   Meet in one line: and vast confusion waites
2158   As doth a Rauen on a sicke- falne beast,
2159   The iminent decay of wrested pompe.
2160   Now happy he, whose cloake and center can
2161   Hold out this tempest. Beare away that childe,
2162   And follow me with speed: Ile to the King:
2163   A thousand businesses are briefe in hand,
2164   And heauen it selfe doth frowne vpon the Land.  <D {Exit}.>
2165   <Z {Actus Quartus, Scaena prima}.>
2166   <D {Enter King Iohn and Pandolph, attendants}.>
2167   <S {K.Iohn}.> Thus haue I yeelded vp into your hand
2168   The Circle of my glory.
2169   <S {Pan}.> Take againe
2170   From this my hand, as holding of the Pope
2171   Your Soueraigne greatnesse and authoritie.
2172  *<S {Iohn}.> Now keep your holy word, go meet the {French},
2173   And from his holinesse vse all your power
2174   To stop their marches 'fore we are enflam'd:
2175   Our discontented Counties doe reuolt:
2176   Our people quarrell with obedience,
2177   Swearing Allegiance, and the loue of soule
2178   To stranger- bloud, to forren Royalty;
2179   This inundation of mistempred humor,
2180   Rests by you onely to be qualified.
2181   Then pause not: for the present time's so sicke,
2182   That present medcine must be ministred,
2183   Or ouerthrow incureable ensues.
2184   <S {Pand}.> It was my breath that blew this Tempest vp,
2185   Vpon your stubborne vsage of the Pope:
2186   But since you are a gentle conuertite,
2187   My tongue shall hush againe this storme of warre,
2188   And make faire weather in your blustring land:
2189   On this Ascention day, remember well,
2190   Vpon your oath of seruice to the Pope,
2191   Goe I to make the {French} lay downe their Armes.  <D {Exit}.>
2192   <S {Iohn}.> Is this Ascension day? did not the Prophet
2193   Say, that before Ascension day at noone,
2194   My Crowne I should giue off? euen so I haue:
2195   I did suppose it should be on constraint,
2196   But (heau'n be thank'd) it is but voluntary.
2197   <D {Enter Bastard}.>
2198  *<S {Bast}.> All Kent hath yeelded: nothing there holds out
2199   But Douer Castle: London hath receiu'd
2200   Like a kinde Host, the Dolphin and his powers.
2201   Your Nobles will not heare you, but are gone
2202   To offer seruice to your enemy:
2203   And wilde amazement hurries vp and downe
2204   The little number of your doubtfull friends.
2205   <S {Iohn}.> Would not my Lords returne to me againe
2206   After they heard yong {Arthur} was aliue?
2207  *<S {Bast}.> They found him dead, and cast into the streets,
2208   An empty Casket, where the Iewell of life
2209   By some damn'd hand was rob'd, and tane away.
2210   <S {Iohn}.> That villaine {Hubert} told me he did liue.
2211   <S {Bast}.> So on my soule he did, for ought he knew:
2212   But wherefore doe you droope? why looke you sad?
2213   Be great in act, as you haue beene in thought:
2214   Let not the world see feare and sad distrust
2215   Gouerne the motion of a kinglye eye:
2216   Be stirring as the time, be fire with fire,
2217   Threaten the threatner, and out- face the brow
2218   Of bragging horror: So shall inferior eyes
2219   That borrow their behauiours from the great,
2220   Grow great by your example, and put on
2221   The dauntlesse spirit of resolution.
2222   Away, and glister like the god of warre
2223   When he intendeth to become the field:
2224   Shew boldnesse and aspiring confidence:
2225   What, shall they seeke the Lion in his denne,
2226   And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
2227   Oh let it not be said: forrage, and runne
2228   To meet displeasure farther from the dores,
2229   And grapple with him ere he come so nye.
2230   <S {Iohn}.> The Legat of the Pope hath beene with mee,
2231   And I haue made a happy peace with him,
2232   And he hath promis'd to dismisse the Powers
2233   Led by the Dolphin.
2234   <S {Bast}.> Oh inglorious league:
2235   Shall we vpon the footing of our land,
2236   Send fayre- play- orders, and make comprimise,
2237   Insinuation, parley, and base truce
2238   To Armes Inuasiue? Shall a beardlesse boy,
2239   A cockred- silken wanton braue our fields,
2240   And flesh his spirit in a warre- like soyle,
2241   Mocking the ayre with colours idlely spred,
2242   And finde no checke? Let vs my Liege to Armes:
2243   Perchance the Cardinall cannot make your peace;
2244   Or if he doe, let it at least be said
2245   They saw we had a purpose of defence.
2246   <S {Iohn}.> Haue thou the ordering of this present time.
2247   <S {Bast}.> Away then with good courage: yet I know
2248   Our Partie may well meet a prowder foe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2249   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
2250  *<D {Enter (in Armes) Dolphin, Salisbury, Meloone, Pem-broke},
2251   {Bigot, Souldiers}.>
2252   <S {Dol}.> My Lord {Melloone}, let this be coppied out,
2253   And keepe it safe for our remembrance:
2254   Returne the president to these Lords againe,
2255   That hauing our faire order written downe,
2256   Both they and we, perusing ore these notes
2257   May know wherefore we tooke the Sacrament,
2258   And keepe our faithes firme and inuiolable.
2259   <S {Sal}.> Vpon our sides it neuer shall be broken.
2260   And Noble Dolphin, albeit we sweare
2261   A voluntary zeale, and an vn- urg'd Faith
2262   To your proceedings: yet beleeue me Prince,
2263   I am not glad that such a sore of Time
2264   Should seeke a plaster by contemn'd reuolt,
2265   And heale the inueterate Canker of one wound,
      <P b4>
2266   By making many: Oh it grieues my soule,
2267   That I must draw this mettle from my side
2268   To be a widdow- maker: oh, and there
2269   Where honourable rescue, and defence
2270   Cries out vpon the name of {Salisbury}.
2271   But such is the infection of the time,
2272   That for the health and Physicke of our right,
2273   We cannot deale but with the very hand
2274   Of sterne Iniustice, and confused wrong:
2275   And is't not pitty, (oh my grieued friends)
2276   That we, the sonnes and children of this Isle,
2277   Was borne to see so sad an houre as this,
2278   Wherein we step after a stranger, march
2279   Vpon her gentle bosom, and fill vp
2280   Her Enemies rankes? I must withdraw, and weepe
2281   Vpon the spot of this inforced cause,
2282   To grace the Gentry of a Land remote,
2283   And follow vnacquainted colours heere:
2284   What heere? O Nation that thou couldst remoue,
2285   That {Neptunes} Armes who clippeth thee about,
2286   Would beare thee from the knowledge of thy selfe,
2287   And cripple thee vnto a Pagan shore,
2288   Where these two Christian Armies might combine
2289   The bloud of malice, in a vaine of league,
2290   And not to spend it so vn- neighbourly.
2291   <S {Dolph}.> A noble temper dost thou shew in this,
2292   And great affections wrastling in thy bosome
2293   Doth make an earth- quake  of Nobility:
2294   Oh, what a noble combat hast fought
2295   Between compulsion, and a braue respect:
2296   Let me wipe off this honourable dewe,
2297   That siluerly doth progresse on thy cheekes:
2298   My heart hath melted at a Ladies teares,
2299   Being an ordinary Inundation:
2300   But this effusion of such manly drops,
2301   This showre, blowne vp by tempest of the soule,
2302   Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amaz'd
2303   Then had I seene the vaultie top of heauen
2304   Figur'd quite ore with burning Meteors.
2305   Lift vp thy brow (renowned {Salisburie})
2306   And with a great heart heaue away this storme:
2307   Commend these waters to those baby- eyes
2308   That neuer saw the giant- world enrag'd,
2309   Nor met with Fortune, other then at feasts,
2310   Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossipping:
2311   Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deepe
2312   Into the purse of rich prosperity
2313   As {Lewis} himselfe: so (Nobles) shall you all,
2314   That knit your sinewes to the strength of mine.
2315   <D {Enter Pandulpho}.>
2316   And euen there, methinkes an Angell spake,
2317   Looke where the holy Legate comes apace,
2318   To giue vs warrant from the hand of heauen,
2319   And on our actions set the name of right
2320   With holy breath.
2321   <S {Pand}.> Haile noble Prince of {France}:
2322   The next is this: King {Iohn} hath reconcil'd
2323   Himselfe to {Rome}, his spirit is come in,
2324   That so stood out against the holy Church,
2325   The great Metropolis and Sea of Rome:
2326   Therefore thy threatning Colours now winde vp,
2327   And tame the sauage spirit of wilde warre,
2328   That like a Lion fostered vp at hand,
2329   It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
2330   And be no further harmefull then in shewe.
2331  *<S {Dol}.> Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not backe:
2332   I am too high- borne to be proportied
2333   To be a secondary at controll,
2334   Or vsefull seruing- man, and Instrument
2335   To any Soueraigne State throughout the world.
2336   Your breath first kindled the dead coale of warres,
2337   Betweene this chastiz'd kingdome and my selfe,
2338   And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
2339   And now 'tis farre too huge to be blowne out
2340   With that same weake winde, which enkindled it:
2341   You taught me how to know the face of right,
2342   Acquainted me with interest to this Land,
2343   Yea, thrust this enterprize into my heart,
2344   And come ye now to tell me {Iohn} hath made
2345   His peace with {Rome}? what is that peace to me?
2346   I (by the honour of my marriage bed)
2347   After yong {Arthur}, claime this Land for mine,
2348   And now it is halfe conquer'd, must I backe,
2349   Because that {Iohn} hath made his peace with {Rome}?
2350   Am I {Romes} slaue? What penny hath {Rome} borne?
2351   What men prouided? What munition sent
2352   To vnder- prop this Action? Is't not I
2353   That vnder- goe this charge? Who else but I,
2354   And such as to my claime are liable,
2355   Sweat in this businesse, and maintaine this warre?
2356   Haue I not heard these Islanders shout out
2357   {Viue le Roy}, as I haue bank'd their Townes?
2358   Haue I not heere the best Cards for the game
2359   To winne this easie match, plaid for a Crowne?
2360   And shall I now giue ore the yeelded Set?
2361   No, no, on my soule it neuer shall be said.
2362   <S {Pand}.> You looke but on the out- side of this worke.
2363   <S {Dol}.> Out- side or in- side, I will not returne
2364   Till my attempt so much be glorified,
2365   As to my ample hope was promised,
2366   Before I drew this gallant head of warre,
2367   And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
2368   To out- looke Conquest, and to winne renowne
2369   Euen in the iawes of danger, and of death:
2370   What lusty Trumpet thus doth summon vs?
2371   <D {Enter Bastard}.>
2372   <S {Bast}.> According to the faire- play of the world,
2373   Let me haue audience: I am sent to speake:
2374   My holy Lord of Millane, from the King
2375   I come to learne how you haue dealt for him:
2376   And, as you answer, I doe know the scope
2377   And warrant limited vnto my tongue.
2378   <S {Pand}.> The {Dolphin} is too wilfull opposite
2379   And will not temporize with my intreaties:
2380   He flatly saies, hee'll not lay downe his Armes.
2381   <S {Bast}.> By all the bloud that euer fury breath'd,
2382   The youth saies well. Now heare our {English} King,
2383   For thus his Royaltie doth speake in me:
2384   He is prepar'd, and reason #to he should,
2385   This apish and vnmannerly approach,
2386   This harness'd Maske, and vnaduised Reuell,
2387   This vn- heard sawcinesse and boyish Troopes,
2388   The King doth smile at, and is well prepar'd
2389   To whip this dwarfish warre, this Pigmy Armes
2390   From out the circle of his Territories.
2391   That hand which had the strength, euen at your dore,
2392   To cudgell you, and make you take the hatch,
2393   To diue like Buckets in concealed Welles,
2394   To crowch in litter of your stable plankes,
2395   To lye like pawnes, lock'd vp in chests and truncks,
2396   To hug with swine, to seeke sweet safety out
2397   In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake,
      <P b4v><C B>
2398   Euen at the crying of your Nations crow,
2399   Thinking this voyce an armed Englishman.
2400   Shall that victorious hand be feebled heere,
2401   That in your Chambers gaue you chasticement?
2402   No: know the gallant Monarch is in Armes,
2403   And like an Eagle, o're his ayerie towres,
2404   To sowsse annoyance that comes neere his Nest;
2405   And you degenerate, you ingrate Reuolts,
2406   You bloudy Nero's, ripping vp the wombe
2407   Of your deere Mother- England: blush for shame:
2408   For your owne Ladies, and pale- visag'd Maides,
2409   Like {Amazons}, come tripping after drummes:
2410   Their thimbles into armed Gantlets change,
2411   Their Needl's to Lances, and their gentle hearts
2412   To fierce and bloody inclination.
2413  *<S {Dol}.> There end thy braue, and turn thy face in peace,
2414   We grant thou canst out- scold vs: Far thee well,
2415   We hold our time too precious to be spent
2416   with such a brabler.
2417   <S {Pan}.> Giue me leaue to speake.
2418   <S {Bast}.> No, I will speake.
2419   <S {Dol}.> We will attend to neyther:
2420   Strike vp the drummes, and let the tongue of warre
2421   Pleade for our interest, and our being heere.
2422  *<S {Bast}.> Indeede your drums being beaten, wil cry out;
2423   And so shall you, being beaten: Do but start
2424   An eccho with the clamor of thy drumme,
2425   And euen at hand, a drumme is readie brac'd,
2426   That shall reuerberate all, as lowd as thine.
2427   Sound but another, and another shall
2428   (As lowd as thine) rattle the Welkins eare,
2429   And mocke the deepe mouth'd Thunder: for at hand
2430   (Not trusting to this halting Legate heere,
2431   Whom he hath vs'd rather for sport, then neede)
2432   Is warlike {Iohn}: and in his fore- head sits
2433   A bare- rib'd death, whose office is this day
2434   To feast vpon whole thousands of the French.
2435  *<S {Dol}.> Strike vp our drummes, to finde this danger out.
2436  *<S {Bast}.> And thou shalt finde it (Dolphin) do not doubt
2437   <D {Exeunt}.>
2438   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
2439   <D {Alarums. Enter Iohn and Hubert}.>
2440   <S {Iohn}.> How goes the day with vs? oh tell me {Hubert}.
2441   <S {Hub}.> Badly I feare; how fares your Maiesty?
2442   <S {Iohn}.> This Feauer that hath troubled me so long,
2443   Lyes heauie on me: oh, my heart is sicke.
2444   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2445   <S {Mes}.> My Lord: your valiant kinsman {Falconbridge},
2446   Desires your Maiestie to leaue the field,
2447   And send him word by me, which way you go.
2448  *<S {Iohn}.> Tell him toward {Swinsted}, to the Abbey there.
2449   <S {Mes}.> Be of good comfort: for the great supply
2450   That was expected by the Dolphin heere,
2451   Are wrack'd three nights ago on {Goodwin} sands.
2452   This newes was brought to {Richard} but euen now,
2453   The French fight coldly, and retyre themselues.
2454   <S {Iohn}.> Aye me, this tyrant Feauer burnes mee vp,
2455   And will not let me welcome this good newes.
2456   Set on toward {Swinsted}: to my Litter straight,
2457   Weaknesse possesseth me, and I am faint.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2458   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2459   <D {Enter Salisbury, Pembroke, and Bigot}.>
2460  *<S {Sal}.> I did not thinke the King so stor'd with friends.
2461   <S {Pem}.> Vp once againe: put spirit in the French,
2462   If they miscarry: we miscarry too.
2463   <S {Sal}.> That misbegotten diuell {Falconbridge},
2464   In spight of spight, alone vpholds the day.
2465  *<S {Pem}.> They say King {Iohn} sore sick, hath left the field.
2466   <D {Enter Meloon wounded}.>
2467   <S {Mel}.> Lead me to the Reuolts of England heere.
2468   <S {Sal}.> When we were happie, we had other names.
2469   <S {Pem}.> It is the Count {Meloone}.
2470   <S {Sal}.> Wounded to death.
2471   <S {Mel}.> Fly Noble English, you are bought and sold,
2472   Vnthred the rude eye of Rebellion,
2473   And welcome home againe discarded faith,
2474   Seeke out King {Iohn}, and fall before his feete:
2475   For if the French be Lords of this loud day,
2476   He meanes to recompence the paines you take,
2477   By cutting off your heads: Thus hath he sworne,
2478   And I with him, and many moe with mee,
2479   Vpon the Altar at S[aint]. {Edmondsbury},
2480   Euen on that Altar, where we swore to you
2481   Deere Amity, and euerlasting loue.
2482   <S {Sal}.> May this be possible? May this be true?
2483   <S {Mel}.> Haue I not hideous death within my view,
2484   Retaining but a quantity of life,
2485   Which bleeds away, euen as a forme of waxe
2486   Resolueth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
2487   What in the world should make me now deceiue,
2488   Since I must loose the vse of all deceite?
2489   Why should I then be false, since it is true
2490   That I must dye heere, and liue hence, by Truth?
2491   I say againe, if {Lewis} do win the day,
2492   He is forsworne, if ere those eyes of yours
2493   Behold another day breake in the East:
2494   But euen this night, whose blacke contagious breath
2495   Already smoakes about the burning Crest
2496   Of the old, feeble, and day- wearied Sunne,
2497   Euen this #ill night, your breathing shall expire,
2498   Paying the fine of rated Treachery,
2499   Euen with a treacherous fine of all your liues:
2500   If {Lewis}, by your assistance win the day.
2501   Commend me to one {Hubert}, with your King;
2502   The loue of him, and this respect besides
2503   (For that my Grandsire was an Englishman)
2504   Awakes my Conscience to confesse all this.
2505   In lieu whereof, I pray you beare me hence
2506   From forth the noise and rumour of the Field;
2507   Where I may thinke the remnant of my thoughts
2508   In peace: and part this bodie and my soule
2509   With contemplation, and deuout desires.
2510   <S {Sal}.> We do beleeue thee, and beshrew my soule,
2511   But I do loue the fauour, and the forme
2512   Of this most faire occasion, by the which
2513   We will vntread the steps of damned flight,
2514   And like a bated and retired Flood,
2515   Leauing our ranknesse and irregular course,
2516   Stoope lowe within those bounds we haue ore- look'd,
2517   And calmely run on in obedience
2518   Euen to our Ocean, to our great King {Iohn}.
2519   My arme shall giue thee helpe to beare thee hence,
      <P b5>
2520   For I do see the cruell pangs of death
2521   Right in thine eye. Away, my friends, new flight,
2522   And happie newnesse, that intends old right.  <D {Exeunt}>
2523   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
2524   <D {Enter Dolphin, and his Traine}.>
2525  *<S {Dol}.> The Sun of heauen (me thought) was loth to set;
2526   But staid, and made the Westerne Welkin blush,
2527   When English measure backward their owne ground
2528   In faint Retire: Oh brauely came we off,
2529   When with a volley of our needlesse shot,
2530   After such bloody toile, we bid good night,
2531   And woon'd our tott'ring colours clearly vp,
2532   Last in the field, and almost Lords  of it.
2533   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2534   <S {Mes}.> Where is my Prince, the Dolphin?
2535   <S {Dol}.> Heere: what newes?
2536  *<S {Mes}.> The Count {Meloone} is slaine: The English Lords
2537   By his perswasion, are againe falne off,
2538   And your supply, which you haue wish'd so long,
2539   Are cast away, and sunke on {Goodwin} sands.
2540   <S {Dol}.> Ah fowle, shrew'd newes. Beshrew thy very |(hart:
2541   I did not thinke to be so sad to night
2542   As this hath made me. Who was he that said
2543   King {Iohn} did flie an houre or two before
2544   The stumbling night did part our wearie powres?
2545   <S {Mes}.> Who euer spoke it, it is true my Lord.
2546  *<S {Dol}.> Well: keepe good quarter, & good care to night,
2547   The day shall not be vp so soone as I,
2548   To try the faire aduenture of to morrow.  <D {Exeunt}>
2549   <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
2550   <D {Enter Bastard and Hubert, seuerally}.>
2551  *<S {Hub}.> Whose there? Speake hoa, speake quickely, or
2552   I shoote.
2553   <S {Bast}.> A Friend. What art thou?
2554   <S {Hub}.> Of the part of England.
2555   <S {Bast}.> Whether doest thou go?
2556   <S {Hub}.> What's that to thee?
2557   Why may not I demand of thine affaires,
2558   As well as thou of mine?
2559   <S {Bast}.> {Hubert}, I thinke.
2560   <S {Hub}.> Thou hast a perfect thought:
2561   I will vpon all hazards well beleeue
2562   Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well:
2563   Who art thou?
2564   <S {Bast}.> Who thou wilt: and if thou please
2565   Thou maist be- friend me so much, as to thinke
2566   I come one way of the {Plantagenets}.
2567  *<S {Hub}.> Vnkinde remembrance: thou, & endles night,
2568   Haue done me shame: Braue Soldier, pardon me,
2569   That any accent breaking from thy tongue,
2570   Should scape the true acquaintance of mine eare.
2571  *<S {Bast}.> Come, come: sans complement, What newes
2572   abroad?
2573  *<S {Hub}.> Why heere walke I in  the black brow of night
2574   To finde you out.
2575   <S {Bast}.> Breefe then: and what's the newes?
2576   <S {Hub}.> O my sweet sir, newes fitting to the night,
2577   Blacke, fearefull, comfortlesse, and horrible.
2578   <S {Bast}.> Shew me the very wound of this #ill newes,
2579   I am no woman, Ile not swound at it.
2580   <S {Hub}.> The King I feare is poyson'd by a Monke,
2581   I left him almost speechlesse, and broke out
2582   To acquaint you with this euill, that you might
2583   The better arme you to the sodaine time,
2584   Then if you had at leisure knowne of this.
2585   <S {Bast}.> How did he take it? Who did taste to him?
2586   <S {Hub}.> A Monke I tell you, a resolued villaine
2587   Whose Bowels sodainly burst out: The King
2588   Yet speakes, and peraduenture may recouer.
2589   <S {Bast}.> Who didst thou leaue to tend his Maiesty?
2590   <S {Hub}.> Why know you not? The Lords are all come
2591   backe,
2592   And brought Prince {Henry} in their companie,
2593   At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
2594   And they are all about his Maiestie.
2595  *<S {Bast}.> With- hold thine indignation, mighty heauen,
2596   And tempt vs not to beare aboue our power.
2597   Ile tell thee {Hubert}, halfe my power this night
2598   Passing these Flats, are taken by the Tide,
2599   These Lincolne- Washes haue deuoured them,
2600   My selfe, well mounted, hardly haue escap'd.
2601   Away before: Conduct me to the king,
2602   I doubt he will be dead, or ere I come.  <D {Exeunt}>
2603   <Z {Scena Septima}.>
2604   <D {Enter Prince Henry, Salisburie, and Bigot}.>
2605   <S {Hen}.> It is too late, the life of all his blood
2606   Is touch'd, corruptibly: and his pure braine
2607   (Which some suppose the soules fraile dwelling house)
2608   Doth by the idle Comments that it makes,
2609   Fore- tell the ending of mortality.
2610   <D {Enter Pembroke}.>
2611  *<S {Pem}.> His Highnesse yet doth speak, & holds beleefe,
2612   That being brought into the open ayre,
2613   It would allay the burning qualitie
2614   Of that fell poison which assayleth him.
2615   <S {Hen}.> Let him be brought into the Orchard heere:
2616   Doth he still rage?
2617   <S {Pem}.> He is more patient
2618   Then when you left him; euen now he sung.
2619   <S {Hen}.> Oh vanity of sicknesse: fierce extreames
2620   In their continuance, will not feele themselues.
2621   Death hauing praide vpon the outward parts
2622   Leaues them inuisible, and his seige is now
2623   Against the winde, the which he prickes and wounds
2624   With many legions of strange fantasies,
2625   Which in their throng, and presse to that last hold,
2626  *Counfound themselues. 'Tis strange y death shold sing:
2627   I am the Symet to this pale faint Swan,
2628   Who chaunts a dolefull hymne to his owne death,
2629   And from the organ- pipe of frailety sings
2630   His soule and body to their lasting rest.
2631  *<S {Sal}.> Be of good comfort (Prince) for you are borne
2632   To set a forme vpon that indigest
2633   Which he hath left so shapelesse, and so rude.
2634   <D {#Iohn brought in}.>
2635   <S {Iohn}.> #I marrie, now my soule hath elbow roome,
      <P b5v>
2636   It would not out at windowes, nor at doores,
2637   There is so hot a summer in my bosome,
2638   That all my bowels crumble vp to dust:
2639   I am a scribled forme drawne with a pen
2640   Vpon a Parchment, and against this fire
2641   Do I shrinke vp.
2642   <S {Hen}.> How fares your Maiesty?
2643   <S {Ioh}.> Poyson'd, #ill fare: dead, forsooke, cast off,
2644   And none of you will bid the winter come
2645   To thrust his ycie fingers in my maw;
2646   Nor let my kingdomes Riuers take their course
2647   Through my burn'd bosome: nor intreat the North
2648   To make his bleake windes kisse my parched lips,
2649   And comfort me with cold. I do not aske you much,
2650   I begge cold comfort: and you are so straight
2651   And so ingratefull, you deny me that.
2652   <S {Hen}.> Oh that there were some vertue in my teares,
2653   That might releeue you.
2654   <S {Iohn}.> The salt in them is hot.
2655   Within me is a #hell, and there the poyson
2656   Is, as a fiend, confin'd to tyrannize,
2657   On vnrepreeuable condemned blood.
2658   <D {Enter Bastard}.>
2659   <S {Bast}.> Oh, I am scalded with my violent motion
2660   And spleene of speede, to see your Maiesty.
2661   <S {Iohn}.> Oh Cozen, thou art come to set mine eye:
2662   The tackle of my heart, is crack'd and burnt,
2663   And all the shrowds wherewith  my life should saile,
2664   Are turned to one thred, one little haire:
2665   My heart hath one poore string to stay it by,
2666   Which holds but till thy newes be vttered,
2667   And then all this thou seest, is but a clod,
2668   And module of confounded royalty.
2669   <S {Bast}.> The Dolphin is preparing hither- ward,
2670   Where heauen he knowes how we shall answer him.
2671   For in a night the best part of my powre,
2672   As I vpon aduantage did remoue,
2673   Were in the {Washes} all vnwarily,
2674   Deuoured by the vnexpected flood.
2675  *<S {Sal}.> You breath these dead newes in as dead an eare
2676   My Liege, my Lord: but now a King, now thus.
2677   <S {Hen}.> Euen so must I run on, and euen so stop.
2678   What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
2679   When this was now a King, and now is clay?
2680   <S {Bast}.> Art thou gone so? I do but stay behinde,
2681   To do the office for thee, of reuenge,
2682   And then my soule shall waite on thee to heauen,
2683   As it on earth hath bene thy seruant still.
2684  *Now, now you Starres, that moue in your right spheres,
2685  *Where be your powres? Shew now your mended faiths,
2686   And instantly returne with me againe.
2687   To push destruction, and perpetuall shame
2688   Out of the weake doore of our fainting Land:
2689   Straight let vs seeke, or straight we shall be sought,
2690   The Dolphine rages at our verie heeles.
2691   <S {Sal}.> It seemes you know not then so much as we,
2692   The Cardinall {Pandulph} is within at rest,
2693   Who halfe an houre since came from the Dolphin,
2694   And brings from him such offers of our peace,
2695   As we with honor and respect may take,
2696   With purpose presently to leaue this warre.
2697   <S {Bast}.> He will the rather do it, when he sees
2698   Our selues well sinew'd to our defence.
2699   <S {Sal}.> Nay, 'tis in a manner done already,
2700   For many carriages hee hath dispatch'd
2701   To the sea side, and put his cause and quarrell
2702   To the disposing of the Cardinall,
2703   With whom your selfe, my selfe, and other Lords,
2704   If you thinke meete, this afternoone will poast
2705   To consummate this businesse happily.
2706   <S {Bast}.> Let it be so, and you my noble Prince,
2707   With other Princes that may best be spar'd,
2708   Shall waite vpon your Fathers Funerall.
2709   <S {Hen}.> At Worster must his bodie be interr'd,
2710   For so he will'd it.
2711   <S {Bast}.> Thither shall it then,
2712   And happily may your sweet selfe put on
2713   The lineall state, and glorie of the Land,
2714   To whom with all submission on my knee,
2715   I do bequeath my faithfull seruices
2716   And true subiection euerlastingly.
2717   <S {Sal}.> And the like tender of our loue wee make
2718   To rest without a spot for euermore.
2719   <S {Hen}.> I haue a kinde soule, that would giue thankes,
2720   And knowes not how to do it, but with teares.
2721   <S {Bast}.> Oh let vs pay the time: but needfull woe,
2722   Since it hath beene before hand with our greefes.
2723   This England neuer did, nor neuer shall
2724   Lye  at the proud foote of a Conqueror,
2725   But when it first did helpe to wound it selfe.
2726   Now, these her Princes are come home againe,
2727   Come the three corners of the world in Armes,
2728   And we shall shocke them: Naught shall make vs rue,
2729   If England to it selfe, do rest but true.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2730   <Z The life and death of King Iohn.>
