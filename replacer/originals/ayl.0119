2      <D {Enter Orlando and Adam}.>
3      <S {Orlando}.>
4     *As I remember {Adam}, it was vpon this fashion
5     *bequeathed me by #will, but poore a thousand
6     *Crownes, and as thou saist, charged my bro-ther
7     *on his blessing to breed mee well: and
8     *there begins my sadnesse: My brother {Iaques} he keepes
9     *at schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit:
10    *for my part, he keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak
11    *more properly) staies me heere at home vnkept: for call
12    *you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that dif-fers
13    *not from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are bred
14    *better, for besides that they are faire with their feeding,
15    *they are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders
16    *deerely hir'd: but I (his brother) gaine nothing vnder
17    *him but growth, for the which his Animals on his
18    *dunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this no-thing
19    *that he so plentifully giues me, the something that
20    *nature gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from
21    *me: hee lets mee feede with his Hindes, barres mee the
22    *place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my
23    *gentility with my education. This is it {Adam} that
24    *grieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke
25    *is within mee, begins to mutinie against this seruitude.
26    *I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise
27     remedy how to auoid it.
28     <D {Enter Oliuer}.>
29     <S {Adam}.> Yonder comes my Master, your brother.
30    *<S {Orlan}.> Goe a- part {Adam}, and thou shalt heare how
31     he will shake me vp.
32     <S {Oli}.> Now Sir, what make you heere?
33     <S {Orl}.> Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
34     <S {Oli}.> What mar you then sir?
35    *<S {Orl}.> Marry sir, I am helping you to mar that which
36    *God made, a poore vnworthy brother of yours with
37     idlenesse.
38    *<S {Oliuer}.> Marry sir be better employed, and be naught
39     #a while.
40    *<S {Orlan}.> Shall I keepe your hogs, and eat huskes with
41    *them? what prodigall portion haue I spent, that I should
42     come to such penury?
43     <S {Oli}.> Know you where you are sir?
44     <S {Orl}.> O sir, very well: heere in your Orchard.
45     <S {Oli}.> Know you before whom sir?
46    *<S {Orl}.> #I, better then him I am before knowes mee: I
47    *know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle con-dition
48    *of bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of
49    *nations allowes you my better, in that you are the first
50    *borne, but the same tradition takes not away my bloud,
51    *were there twenty brothers betwixt vs: I haue as much
52    *of my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your com-ming
53     before me is neerer to his reuerence.
54     <S {Oli}.> What Boy.
55    *<S {Orl}.> Come, come elder brother, you are too yong in |(this.
56     <S {Oli}.> Wilt thou lay hands on me villaine?
57    *<S {Orl}.> I am no villaine: I am the yongest sonne of Sir
58    *{Rowland de Boys}, he was my father, and he is thrice a vil-laine
59    *that saies such a father begot villaines: wert thou
60    *not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy
61    *throat, till this other had puld out thy tongue for saying
62     so, thou hast raild on thy selfe.
63    *<S {Adam}.> Sweet Masters bee patient, for your Fathers
64     remembrance, be at accord.
65     <S {Oli}.> Let me goe I say.
66    *<S {Orl}.> I will not till I please: you shall heare mee: my
67    *father charg'd you in his #will to giue me good educati-on:
68    *you haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and
69    *hiding from me all gentleman- like qualities: the spirit
70    *of my father growes strong in mee, and I will no longer
71    *endure it: therefore allow me such exercises as may be-come
72    *a gentleman, or giue mee the poore allottery my
73    *father left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my
74     fortunes.
75    *<S {Oli}.> And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?
76    *Well sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with
77    *you: you shall haue some part of your #will, I pray you
78     leaue me.
79    *<S {Orl}.> I will no further offend you, then becomes mee
80     for my good.
81     <S {Oli}.> Get you with him, you olde dogge.
82    *<S {Adam}.> Is old dogge my reward: most true, I haue
83    *lost my teeth in your seruice: God be with my olde ma-ster,
84    *he would not haue spoke such a word.  <D {Ex. Orl. Ad}.>
85    *<S {Oli}.> Is it euen so, begin you to grow vpon me? I will
86    *physicke your ranckenesse, and yet giue no thousand
87     crownes neyther: holla {Dennis}.
88     <D {Enter Dennis}.>
89     <S {Den}.> Calls your worship?
90    *<S {Oli}.> Was not {Charles} the Dukes Wrastler heere to
91     speake with me?
92    *<S {Den}.> So please you, he is heere at the doore, and im-portunes
93     accesse to you.
94     <S {Oli}.> Call him in: 'twill be a good way: and to mor-row
95     the wrastling is.
96     <D {Enter Charles}.>
97     <S {Cha}.> Good morrow to your worship.
98    *<S {Oli}.> Good Mounsier {Charles}: what's the new newes
99     at the new Court?
100   *<S {Charles}.> There's no newes at the Court Sir, but the
101   *olde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by his yon-ger
102   *brother the new Duke, and three or foure louing
      <P Q3v>
103   *Lords haue put themselues into voluntary exile with
104   *him, whose lands and reuenues enrich the new Duke,
105    therefore he giues them good leaue to wander.
106   *<S {Oli}.> Can you tell if {Rosalind} the Dukes daughter bee
107    banished with her Father?
108   *<S {Cha}.> O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so
109   *loues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together,
110   *that hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to
111   *stay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued
112   *of her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two La-dies
113    loued as they doe.
114    <S {Oli}.> Where will the old Duke liue?
115   *<S {Cha}.> They say hee is already in the Forrest of {Arden},
116   *and a many merry men with him; and there they liue
117   *like the old {Robin Hood} of {England}: they say many yong
118   *Gentlemen flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time
119    carelesly as they did in the golden world.
120   *<S {Oli}.> What, you wrastle to morrow before the new
121    Duke.
122   *<S {Cha}.> Marry doe I sir: and I came to acquaint you
123   *with a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand, that
124   *your yonger brother {Orlando} hath a disposition to come
125   *in disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I
126   *wrastle for my credit, and hee that escapes me without
127   *some broken limbe, shall acquit him well: your brother
128   *is but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee
129   *loth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if hee
130   *come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither
131   *to acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him
132   *from his intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he
133   *shall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne search,
134    and altogether against my #will.
135   *<S {Oli}. {Charles}>, I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which
136   *thou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had my
137   *selfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by
138   *vnder- hand meanes laboured to disswade him from it;
139   *but he is resolute. Ile tell thee {Charles}, it is the stubbor-nest
140   *yong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious
141   *emulator of euery mans good parts, a secret & villanous
142   *contriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse
143   *thy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke
144   *as his finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou
145   *dost him any slight disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie
146   *grace himselfe on thee, hee will practise against thee by
147   *poyson, entrap thee by some treacherous deuise, and ne-uer
148   *leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some indirect
149   *meanes or other: for I assure thee, (and almost with
150   *teares I speake it) there is not one so young, and so vil-lanous
151   *this day liuing. I speake but brotherly of him,
152   *but should I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I must
153   *blush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and
154    wonder.
155   *<S {Cha}.> I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee
156   *come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee
157   *goe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and
158    so God keepe your worship.  <D {Exit}.>
159   *Farewell good {Charles}. Now will I stirre this Game-ster:
160   *I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet
161   *I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee's
162   *gentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble
163   *deuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed
164   *so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my
165   *owne people, who best know him, that I am altogether
166   *misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall
167   *cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy
168    thither, which now Ile goe about.  <D {Exit}.>
169    <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
170    <D {Enter Rosalind, and Cellia}.>
171    <S {Cel}.> I pray thee {Rosalind}, sweet my Coz, be merry.
172   *<S {Ros}.> Deere {Cellia}; I show more mirth then I am mi-stresse
173   *of, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you
174   *could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
175   *learne mee how to remember any extraordinary plea-sure.
176   _
177   *<S {Cel}.> Heerein I see thou lou'st mee not with the full
178   *waight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished father
179   *had banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou
180   *hadst beene still with mee, I could haue taught my loue
181   *to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth
182   *of thy loue to me were so righteously temper'd, as mine
183    is to thee.
184   *<S {Ros}.> Well, I will forget the condition of my estate,
185    to reioyce in yours.
186   *<S {Cel}.> You know my Father hath no childe, but I, nor
187   *none is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou shalt
188   *be his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy fa-ther
189   *perforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by
190   *mine honor I will, and when I breake that oath, let mee
191   *turne monster: therefore my sweet {Rose}, my deare {Rose},
192    be merry.
193   *<S {Ros}.> From henceforth I will Coz, and deuise sports:
194    let me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue?
195   *<S {Cel}.> Marry I prethee doe, to make sport withall: but
196   *loue no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport ney-ther,
197   *then with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in ho-nor
198    come off againe.
199    <S {Ros}.> What shall be our sport then?
200   *<S {Cel}.> Let vs sit and mocke the good houswife {For-tune}
201   *from her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee
202    bestowed equally.
203   *<S {Ros}.> I would wee could doe so: for her benefits are
204   *mightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman
205    doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
206   *<S {Cel}.> 'Tis true, for those that she makes faire, she scarce
207   *makes honest, & those that she makes honest, she makes
208    very illfauouredly.
209   *<S {Ros}.> Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Na-tures:
210   *Fortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the
211    lineaments of Nature.
212    <D {Enter Clowne}.>
213   *<S {Cel}.> No; when Nature hath made a faire creature,
214   *may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though nature
215   *hath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune
216    sent in this foole to cut off the argument?
217   *<S {Ros}.> Indeed there is fortune too hard for nature, when
218   *fortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off of natures
219    witte.
220   *<S {Cel}.> Peraduenture this is not Fortunes work neither,
221   *but Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits too dull
222   *to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for
223   *our whetstone: for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is
224   *the whetstone of the wits. How now Witte, whether
225    wander you?
226   *<S {Clow}.> Mistresse, you must come away to your father.
227    <S {Cel}.> Were you made the messenger?
228   *<S {Clo}.> No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you
      <P Q4><C B>
229    <S {Ros}.> Where learned you that oath foole?
230   *<S {Clo}.> Of a certaine Knight, that swore by his Honour
231   *they were good Pan- cakes, and swore by his Honor the
232   *Mustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes
233   *were naught, and the Mustard was good, and yet was
234    not the Knight forsworne.
235   *<S {Cel}.> How proue you that in the great heape of your
236    knowledge?
237    <S {Ros}.> #I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome.
238   *<S {Clo}.> Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes,
239    and sweare by your beards that I am a knaue.
240    <S {Cel}.> By our beards (if we had them) thou art.
241   *<S {Clo}.> By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if
242   *you sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
243   *more was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he ne-uer
244   *had anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before
245    euer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard.
246    <S {Cel}.> Prethee, who is't that thou means't?
247    <S {Clo}.> One that old {Fredericke} your Father loues.
248   *<S {Ros}.> My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough;
249   *speake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one
250    of these daies.
251   *<S {Clo}.> The more pittie that fooles may not speak wise-ly,
252    what Wisemen do foolishly.
253   *<S {Cel}.> By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little
254   *wit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that
255   *wise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Mon-sieur
256    the {Beu}.
257    <D {Enter le Beau}.>
258    <S {Ros}.> With his mouth full of newes.
259   *<S {Cel}.> Which he will put on vs, as Pigeons feed their
260    young.
261    <S {Ros}.> Then shal we be newes- cram'd.
262   *<S {Cel}.> All the better: we shalbe the more Marketable.
263    {Boon- iour Monsieur le Beu}, what's the newes?
264    <S {Le} {Beu}.>  Faire Princesse,
265    you haue lost much good sport.
266    <S {Cel}.> Sport: of what colour?
267   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> What colour Madame? How shall I aun-swer
268    you?
269    <S {Ros}.> As wit and fortune will.
270    <S {Clo}.> Or as the destinies decrees.
271    <S {Cel}.> Well said, that was laid on with a trowell.
272    <S {Clo}.> Nay, if I keepe not my ranke.
273    <S {Ros}.> Thou loosest thy old smell.
274    <S {Le} {Beu}.> You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told
275   *you of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of.
276    <S {Ros}.> Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling.
277   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please
278   *your Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet
279   *to doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to
280    performe it.
281    <S {Cel}.> Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
282   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> There comes an old man, and his three sons.
283    <S {Cel}.> I could match this beginning with an old tale.
284   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> Three proper yong men, of excellent growth
285    and presence.
286   *<S {Ros}.> With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto
287    all men by these presents.
288   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> The eldest of the three, wrastled with {Charles}
289   *the Dukes Wrastler, which {Charles} in a moment threw
290   *him, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little
291   *hope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so the
292   *third: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father,
293   *making such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the behol-ders
294    take his part with weeping.
295    <S {Ros}.> Alas.
296   *<S {Clo}.> But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies
297    haue lost?
298    <S {Le} {Beu}.> Why this that I speake of.
299   *<S {Clo}.> Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the
300   *first time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport
301    for Ladies.
302    <S {Cel}.> Or I, I promise thee.
303   *<S {Ros}.> But is there any else longs to see this broken
304   *Musicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon
305    rib- breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin?
306   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> You must if you stay heere, for heere is the
307   *place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to
308    performe it.
309   *<S {Cel}.> Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay
310    and see it.
311    <D {Flourish. Enter Duke, Lords, Orlando, Charles},
312    {and Attendants}.>
313   *<S {Duke}.> Come on, since the youth will not be intreated
314    His owne perill on his forwardnesse.
315    <S {Ros}.> Is yonder the man?
316    <S {Le} {Beu}.> Euen he, Madam.
317   *<S {Cel}.> Alas, he is too yong: yet he looks successefully
318    <S {Du}.> How now daughter, and Cousin:
319    Are you crept hither to see the wrastling?
320    <S {Ros}.> #I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue.
321   *<S {Du}.> You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you
322   *there is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challen-gers
323   *youth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not
324   *bee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can
325    mooue him.
326    <S {Cel}.> Call him hether good Monsieuer {Le Beu}.
327    <S {Duke}.> Do so: Ile not be by.
328   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> Monsieur the Challenger, the Princesse cals
329    for you.
330    <S {Orl}.> I attend them with all respect and dutie.
331   *<S {Ros}.> Young man, haue you challeng'd {Charles} the
332    Wrastler?
333   *<S {Orl}.> No faire Princesse: he is the generall challenger,
334   *I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength
335    of my youth.
336   *<S {Cel}.> Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
337   *your yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans
338   *strength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew
339   *your selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduen-ture
340   *would counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We
341   *pray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safe-tie,
342    and giue ouer this attempt.
343   *<S {Ros}.> Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore
344   *be misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that
345    the wrastling might not go forward.
346   *<S {Orl}.> I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde
347   *thoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie
348   *so faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your
349   *faire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall;
350   *wherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was
351   *neuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to
352   *be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to
353   *lament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing:
354   *onely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better
355    supplied, when I haue made it emptie.
356   *<S {Ros}.> The little strength that I haue, I would it were
357    with you.
      <P Q4v><C D>
358    <S {Cel}.> And mine to eeke out hers.
359   *<S {Ros}.> Fare you well: praie heauen I be deceiu'd in you.
360    <S {Cel}.> Your hearts desires be with you.
361   *<S {Char}.> Come, where is this yong gallant, that is so
362    desirous to lie with his mother earth?
363   *<S {Orl}.> Readie Sir, but his #will hath in it a more modest
364    working.
365    <S {Duk}.> You shall trie but one fall.
366   *<S {Cha}.> No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat
367   *him to a second, that haue so mightilie perswaded him
368    from a first.
369   *<S {Orl}.> You meane to mocke me after: you should not
370    haue mockt me before: but come your waies.
371    <S {Ros}.> Now Hercules, be thy speede yong man.
372   *<S {Cel}.> I would I were inuisible, to catch the strong fel-low
373    by the legge.  <D {Wrastle}.>
374    <S {Ros}.> Oh excellent yong man.
375   *<S {Cel}.> If I had a thunderbolt in mine eie, I can tell who
376    should downe.  <D {Shout}.>
377    <S {Duk}.> No more, no more.
378   *<S {Orl}.> Yes I beseech your Grace, I am not yet well
379    breath'd.
380    <S {Duk}.> How do'st thou {Charles}?
381    <S {Le} {Beu}.> He cannot speake my Lord.
382    <S {Duk}.> Beare him awaie:
383    What is thy name yong man?
384   *<S {Orl}.> {Orlando} my Liege, the yongest sonne of Sir {Ro-land}
385    {de Boys}.
386   *<S {Duk}.> I would thou hadst beene son to some man else,
387    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
388    But I did finde him still mine enemie:
389    Thou should'st haue better pleas'd me with this deede,
390    Hadst thou descended from another house:
391    But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth,
392    I would thou had'st told me of another Father.
393    <D {Exit Duke}.>
394    <S {Cel}.> Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this?
395    <S {Orl}.> I am more proud to be Sir {Rolands} sonne,
396    His yongest sonne, and would not change that calling
397    To be adopted heire to {Fredricke}.
398    <S {Ros}.> My Father lou'd Sir {Roland} as his soule,
399    And all the world was of my Fathers minde,
400    Had I before knowne this yong man his sonne,
401    I should haue giuen him teares vnto entreaties,
402    Ere he should thus haue ventur'd.
403    <S {Cel}.> Gentle Cosen,
404    Let vs goe thanke him, and encourage him:
405    My Fathers rough and enuious disposition
406    Sticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd,
407    If you doe keepe your promises in loue;
408    But iustly as you haue exceeded all promise,
409    Your Mistris shall be happie.
410    <S {Ros}.> Gentleman,
411    Weare this for me: one out of suites with fortune
412    That could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes.
413    Shall we goe Coze?
414    <S {Cel}.> #I: fare you well faire Gentleman.
415    <S {Orl}.> Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts
416    Are all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp
417    Is but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke.
418   *<S {Ros}.> He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes,
419    Ile aske him what he would: Did you call Sir?
420    Sir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne
421    More then your enemies.
422    <S {Cel}.> Will you goe Coze?
423    <S {Ros}.> Haue with you: fare you well.  <D {Exit}.>
424   *<S {Orl}.> What passion hangs these waights vpo[n] my toong?
425    I cannot speake to her, yet she vrg'd conference.
426    <D {Enter Le Beu}.>
427    O poore {Orlando}! thou art ouerthrowne
428    Or Charles, or something weaker masters thee.
429    <S {Le} {Beu}.> Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you
430    To leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd
431    High commendation, true applause, and loue;
432    Yet such is now the Dukes condition,
433    That he misconsters all that you haue done:
434    The Duke is humorous, what he is indeede
435    More suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of.
436    <S {Orl}.> I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this,
437    Which of the two was daughter of the Duke,
438    That here was at the Wrastling?
439   *<S {Le} {Beu}.> Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners,
440    But yet indeede the taller is his daughter,
441    The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
442    And here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle
443    To keepe his daughter companie, whose loues
444    Are deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters:
445    But I can tell you, that of late this Duke
446    Hath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece,
447    Grounded vpon no other argument,
448    But that the people praise her for her vertues,
449    And pittie her, for her good Fathers sake;
450    And on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady
451    Will sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well,
452    Hereafter in a better world then this,
453    I shall desire more loue and knowledge of you.
454    <S {Orl}.> I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
455    Thus must I from the smoake into the smother,
456    From tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother.
457    But heauenly {Rosaline}.  <D {Exit}>
458    <Z {Scena Tertius}.>
459    <D {Enter Celia and Rosaline}.>
460   *<S {Cel}.> Why Cosen, why {Rosaline}: {Cupid} haue mercie,
461    Not a word?
462    <S {Ros}.> Not one to throw at a dog.
463   *<S {Cel}.> No, thy words are too precious to be cast away
464   *vpon curs, throw some of them at me; come lame mee
465    with reasons.
466   *<S {Ros}.> Then there were two Cosens laid vp, when the
467   *one should be lam'd with reasons, and the other mad
468    without any.
469    <S {Cel}.> But is all this for your Father?
470   *<S {Ros}.> No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh
471    how full of briers is this working day world.
472   *<S {Cel}.> They are but burs, Cosen, throwne vpon thee
473   *in holiday foolerie, if we walke not in the trodden paths
474    our very petty- coates will catch them.
475   *<S {Ros}.> I could shake them off my coate, these burs are
476    in my heart.
477    <S {Cel}.> Hem them away.
478    <S {Ros}.> I would try if I could cry hem, and haue #him.
479    <S {Cel}.> Come, come, wrastle with thy affections.
480   *<S {Ros}.> O they take the part of a better wrastler then
481    my selfe.
482   *<S {Cel}.> O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time
      <P Q5>
483   *in dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice,
484   *let vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a so-daine,
485   *you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir
486    {Roulands} yongest sonne?
487   *<S {Ros}.> The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie.
488   *<S {Cel}.> Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his
489   *Sonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate
490   *him, for my father hated his father deerely; yet I hate
491    not {Orlando}.
492    <S {Ros}.> No faith, hate him not for my sake.
493    <S {Cel}.> Why should I not? doth he not deserue well?
494    <D {Enter Duke with Lords}.>
495    <S {Ros}.> Let me loue him for that, and do you loue him
496    Because I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke.
497    <S {Cel}.> With his eies full of anger.
498    <S {Duk}.> Mistris, dispatch you with your safest haste,
499    And get you from our Court.
500    <S {Ros}.> Me Vncle.
501    <S {Duk}.> You Cosen,
502    Within these ten daies if that thou beest found
503    So neere our publike Court as twentie miles,
504    Thou diest for it.
505    <S {Ros}.> I doe beseech your Grace
506    Let me the knowledge of my fault beare with me:
507    If with my selfe I hold intelligence,
508    Or haue acquaintance with mine owne desires,
509    If that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke,
510    (As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle,
511    Neuer so much as in a thought vnborne,
512    Did I offend your highnesse.
513    <S {Duk}.> Thus doe all Traitors,
514    If their purgation did consist in words,
515    They are as innocent as grace it selfe;
516    Let is suffice thee that I trust thee not.
517    <S {Ros}.> Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor;
518    Tell me whereon the likelihoods depends?
519   *<S {Duk}.> Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough.
520   *<S {Ros}.> So was I when your highnes took his Dukdome,
521    So was I when your highnesse banisht him;
522    Treason is not inherited my Lord,
523    Or if we did deriue it from our friends,
524    What's that to me, my Father was no Traitor,
525    Then good my Leige, mistake me not so much,
526    To thinke my pouertie is treacherous.
527    <S {Cel}.> Deere Soueraigne heare me speake.
528    <S {Duk}.> #I {Celia}, we staid her for your sake,
529    Else had she with her Father rang'd along.
530    <S {Cel}.> I did not then intreat to haue her stay,
531    It was your pleasure, and your owne remorse,
532    I was too yong that time to value her,
533    But now I know her: if she be a Traitor,
534    Why so am I: we still haue slept together,
535    Rose at an instant, learn'd, plaid, eate together,
536    And wheresoere we went, like {Iunos} Swans,
537    Still we went coupled and inseperable.
538   *<S {Duk}.> She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothnes;
539    Her verie silence, and her patience,
540    Speake to the people, and they pittie her:
541    Thou art a foole, she robs thee of thy name,
542   *And thou wilt show more bright, & seem more vertuous
543    When she is gone: then open not thy lips
544    Firme, and irreuocable is my doombe,
545    Which I haue past vpon her, she is banish'd.
546   *<S {Cel}.> Pronounce that sentence then on me my Leige,
547    I cannot liue out of her companie.
548   *<S {Duk}.> You are a foole: you Neice prouide your selfe,
549    If you out- stay the time, vpon mine honor,
550    And in the greatnesse of my word you die.
551    <D {Exit Duke, &c}.>
552    <S {Cel}.> O my poore {Rosaline}, whether wilt thou goe?
553    Wilt thou change Fathers? I will giue thee mine:
554    I charge thee be not thou more grieu'd then I am.
555    <S {Ros}.> I haue more cause.
556    <S {Cel}.> Thou hast not Cosen,
557    Prethee be cheerefull; know'st thou not the Duke
558    Hath banish'd me his daughter?
559    <S {Ros}.> That he hath not.
560    <S {Cel}.> No, hath not? {Rosaline} lacks then the loue
561    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one,
562    Shall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle?
563    No, let my Father seeke another heire:
564    Therefore deuise with me how we may flie
565    Whether to goe, and what to beare with vs,
566    And doe not seeke to take your change vpon you,
567    To beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out:
568    For by this heauen, now at our sorrowes pale;
569    Say what thou canst, Ile goe along with thee.
570    <S {Ros}.> Why, whether shall we goe?
571    <S {Cel}.> To seeke my Vncle in the Forrest of {Arden}.
572    <S {Ros}.> Alas, what danger will it be to vs,
573    (Maides as we are) to trauell forth so farre?
574    Beautie prouoketh theeues sooner then gold.
575    <S {Cel}.> Ile put my selfe in poore and meane attire,
576    And with a kinde of vmber smirch my face,
577    The like doe you, so shall we passe along,
578    And neuer stir assailants.
579    <S {Ros}.> Were it not better,
580    Because that I am more then common tall,
581    That I did suite me all points like a man,
582    A gallant curtelax vpon my thigh,
583    A bore- speare in my hand, and in my heart
584    Lye there what hidden womans feare there will,
585    Weele haue a swashing and a marshall outside,
586    As manie other mannish cowards haue,
587    That doe outface it with their semblances.
588    <S {Cel}.> What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
589   *<S {Ros}.> Ile haue no worse a name then {Ioues} owne Page,
590    And therefore looke you call me {Ganimed}.
591    But what will you be call'd?
592    <S {Cel}.> Something that hath a reference to my state:
593    No longer {Celia}, but {Aliena}.
594    <S {Ros}.> But Cosen, what if we assaid to steale
595    The clownish Foole out of your Fathers Court:
596    Would he not be a comfort to our trauaile?
597    <S {Cel}.> Heele goe along ore the wide world with me,
598    Leaue me alone to woe him; Let's away
599    And get our Iewels and our wealth together,
600    Deuise the fittest time, and safest way
601    To hide vs from pursuite that will be made
602    After my flight: now goe in we content
603    To libertie, and not to banishment.  <D {Exeunt}.>
604    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima}.>
605    <D {Enter Duke Senior: Amyens, and two or three Lords}
606    {like Forresters}.>
607   *<S {Duk.Sen}.> Now my Coe- mates, and brothers in exile:
608    Hath not old custome made this life more sweete
      <P Q5v><C C>
609    Then that of painted pompe? Are not these woods
610    More free from perill then the enuious Court?
611    Heere feele we not the penaltie of {Adam},
612    The seasons difference, as the Icie phange
613    And churlish chiding of the winters winde,
614    Which when it bites and blowes vpon my body
615    Euen till I shrinke with cold, I smile, and say
616    This is no flattery: these are counsellors
617    That feelingly perswade me what I am:
618    Sweet are the vses of aduersitie
619    Which like the toad, ougly and venemous,
620    Weares yet a precious Iewell in his head:
621    And this our life exempt from publike haunt,
622   *Findes tongues in trees, bookes in the running brookes,
623    Sermons in stones, and good in euery thing.
624    <S {Amien}.> I would not change it, happy is your Grace
625    That can translate the stubbornnesse of fortune
626    Into so quiet and so sweet a stile.
627    <S {Du.Sen}.> Come, shall we goe and kill vs venison?
628    And yet it irkes me the poore dapled fooles
629    Being natiue Burgers of this desert City,
630    Should in their owne confines with forked heads
631    Haue their round hanches goard.
632    <S 1.{Lord}.> Indeed my Lord
633    The melancholy {Iaques} grieues at that,
634    And in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe
635    Then doth your brother that hath banish'd you:
636    To day my Lord of {Amiens}, and my selfe,
637    Did steale behinde him as he lay along
638    Vnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes out
639    Vpon the brooke that brawles along this wood,
640    To the which place a poore sequestred Stag
641    That from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt,
642    Did come to languish; and indeed my Lord
643    The wretched annimall heau'd forth such groanes
644    That their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat
645    Almost to bursting, and the big round teares
646    Cours'd one another downe his innocent nose
647    In pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole,
648    Much marked of the melancholie {Iaques},
649    Stood on th' extremest  verge of the swift brooke,
650    Augmenting it with teares.
651    <S {Du.Sen}.> But what said {Iaques}?
652    Did he not moralize this spectacle?
653    <S 1.{Lord}.> O yes, into a thousand similies.
654    First, for his weeping into the needlesse streame;
655    Poore Deere quoth he, thou mak'st a testament
656    As worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more
657    To that which had too much: then being there alone,
658    Left and abandoned of his veluet friend;
659    'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part
660    The Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard
661    Full of the pasture, iumps along by him
662    And neuer staies to greet him: #I quoth {Iaques},
663    Sweepe on you fat and greazie Citizens,
664    'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you looke
665    Vpon that poore and broken bankrupt there?
666    Thus most inuectiuely he pierceth through
667    The body of Countrie, Citie, Court,
668    Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
669    Are meere vsurpers, tyrants, and whats worse
670    To fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp
671    In their assign'd and natiue dwelling place.
672   *<S {D.Sen}.> And did you leaue him in this contemplation?
673    <S 2.{Lord}.> We did my Lord, weeping and commenting
674    Vpon the sobbing Deere.
      <C D>
675    <S {Du.Sen}.> Show me the place,
676    I loue to cope him in these sullen fits,
677    For then he's full of matter.
678    <S 1.{Lor}.> Ile bring you to him strait.  <D {Exeunt}.>
679    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
680    <D {Enter Duke, with Lords}.>
681    <S {Duk}.> Can it be possible that no man saw them?
682    It cannot be, some villaines of my Court
683    Are of consent and sufferance in this.
684    <S 1.{Lo}.> I cannot heare of any that did see her,
685    The Ladies her attendants of her chamber
686    Saw her #a bed, and in the morning early,
687    They found the bed vntreasur'd of their Mistris.
688   *<S 2.{Lor}.> My Lord, the roynish Clown, at whom so oft,
689    Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing,
690    {Hisperia} the Princesse Gentlewoman
691    Confesses that she secretly ore- heard
692    Your daughter and her Cosen much commend
693    The parts and graces of the Wrastler
694    That did but lately foile the synowie {Charles},
695    And she beleeues where euer they are gone
696    That youth is surely in their companie.
697   *<S {Duk}.> Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither,
698    If he be absent, bring his Brother to me,
699    Ile make him finde him: do this sodainly;
700    And let not search and inquisition quaile,
701    To bring againe these foolish runawaies.  <D {Exeunt}.>
702    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
703    <D {Enter Orlando and Adam}.>
704    <S {Orl}.> Who's there?
705    <S {Ad}.> What my yong Master, oh my gentle master,
706    Oh my sweet master, O you memorie
707    Of old Sir {Rowland}; why, what make you here?
708    Why are you vertuous? Why do people loue you?
709    And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
710    Why would you be so fond to ouercome
711    The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?
712    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
713    Know you not Master, to seeme kinde of men,
714    Their graces serue them but as enemies,
715    No more doe yours: your vertues gentle Master
716    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you:
717    Oh what a world is this, when what is comely
718    Enuenoms him that beares it?
719    Why, what's the matter?
720    <S {Ad}.> O vnhappie youth,
721    Come not within these doores: within this roofe
722    The enemie of all your graces liues
723    Your brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne
724    (Yet not the son, I will not call him son)
725    Of him I was about to call his Father,
726    Hath heard your praises, and this night he meanes,
727    To burne the lodging where you vse to lye,
728    And you within it: if he faile of that
      <P Q6>
729    He will haue other meanes to cut you off;
730    I ouerheard him: and his practises:
731    This is no place, this house is but a butcherie;
732    Abhorre it, feare it, doe not enter it.
733   *<S {Ad}.> Why whether {Adam} would'st thou haue me go?
734    <S {Ad}.> No matter whether, so you come not here.
735   *<S {Orl}.> What, would'st thou haue me go & beg my food,
736    Or with a base and boistrous Sword enforce
737    A theeuish liuing on the common rode?
738    This I must do, or know not what to do:
739    Yet this I will not do, do how I can,
740    I rather will subiect me to the malice
741    Of a diuerted blood, and bloudie brother.
742    <S {Ad}.> But do not so: I haue fiue hundred Crownes,
743    The thriftie hire I saued vnder your Father,
744    Which I did store to be my foster Nurse,
745    When seruice should in my old limbs lie lame,
746    And vnregarded age in corners throwne,
747    Take that, and he that doth the Rauens feede,
748    Yea prouidently caters for the Sparrow,
749    Be comfort to my age: here is the gold,
750    All this I giue you, let me be your seruant,
751    Though I looke old, yet I am strong and lustie;
752    For in my youth I neuer did apply
753    Hot, and rebellious liquors in my bloud,
754    Nor did not with vnbashfull forehead woe,
755    The meanes of weaknesse and debilitie,
756    Therefore my age is as a lustie winter,
757    Frostie, but kindely; let me goe with you,
758    Ile doe the seruice of a yonger man
759    In all your businesse and necessities.
760    <S {Orl}.> Oh good old man, how well in thee appeares
761    The constant seruice of the antique world,
762    When seruice sweate for dutie, not for meede:
763    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
764    Where none will sweate, but for promotion,
765    And hauing that do choake their seruice vp,
766    Euen with the #hauing, it is not so with thee:
767    But poore old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree,
768    That cannot so much as a blossome yeelde,
769    In lieu of all thy paines and husbandrie,
770    But come thy waies, weele goe along together,
771    And ere we haue thy youthfull wages spent,
772    Weele light vpon some setled low content.
773    <S {Ad}.> Master goe on, and I will follow thee
774    To the last gaspe with truth and loyaltie,
775    From seauentie yeeres, till now almost fourescore
776    Here liued I, but now liue here no more
777    At seauenteene yeeres, many their fortunes seeke
778    But at fourescore, it is too late a weeke,
779    Yet fortune cannot recompence me better
780    Then to die well, and not my Masters debter.  <D {Exeunt}.>

784    <S {Ros}.> O {Iupiter}, how merry are my spirits?
785   *<S {Clo}.> I care not for my spirits, if my legges were not
786    wearie.
787   *<S {Ros}.> I could finde in my heart to disgrace my mans
788   *apparell, and to cry like a woman: but I must comfort
789   *the weaker vessell, as doublet and hose ought to show it
790   *selfe coragious to petty- coate; therefore courage, good
791    {Aliena}.
792   *<S {Cel}.> I pray you  beare with me, I cannot goe no fur-ther.
793   _
794   *<S {Clo}.> For my part, I had rather beare with you, then
795   *beare you: yet I should beare no crosse if I did beare
796    you, for I thinke you haue no money in your purse.
797    <S {Ros}.> Well, this is the Forrest of {Arden}.
798   *<S {Clo}.> #I, now am I in {Arden}, the more foole I, when I
799   *was at home I was in a better place, but Trauellers must
800    be content.
801    <D {Enter Corin and Siluius}.>
802   *<S {Ros}.> #I, be so good {Touchstone}: Look you, who comes
803    here, a yong man and an old in solemne talke.
804    <S {Cor}.> That is the way to make her scorne you still.
805    <S {Sil}.> Oh {Corin}, that thou knew'st how I do loue her.
806    <S {Cor}.> I partly guesse: for I haue lou'd ere now.
807    <S {Sil}.> No {Corin}, being old, thou canst not guesse,
808    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a louer
809    As euer sigh'd vpon a midnight pillow:
810    But if thy loue were euer like to mine,
811    As sure I thinke did neuer man loue so:
812    How many actions most ridiculous,
813    Hast thou beene drawne to by thy fantasie?
814    <S {Cor}.> Into a thousand that I haue forgotten.
815    <S {Sil}.> Oh thou didst then neuer loue so hartily,
816    If thou remembrest not the slightest folly,
817    That euer loue did make thee run into,
818    Thou hast not lou'd.
819    Or if thou hast not sat as I doe now,
820    Wearing thy hearer in thy Mistris praise,
821    Thou hast not lou'd.
822    Or if thou hast not broke from companie,
823    Abruptly as my passion now makes me,
824    Thou hast not lou'd.
825    O {Phebe, Phebe, Phebe}.  <D {Exit}.>
826   *<S {Ros}.> Alas poore Shepheard searching of they would,
827    I haue by hard aduenture found mine owne.
828   *<S {Clo}.> And I mine: I remember when I was in loue, I
829   *broke my sword vpon a stone, and bid him take that for
830   *comming #a night to {Iane Smile}, and I remember the kis-sing
831   *of her batler, and the Cowes dugs that her prettie
832   *chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember the wooing
833   *of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooke two
834   *cods, and giuing her them againe, said with weeping
835   *teares, weare these for my sake: wee that are true Lo-uers,
836   *runne into strange capers; but as all is mortall in
837    nature, so is all nature in loue, mortall in folly.
838    <S {Ros}.> Thou speak'st wiser then thou art ware of.
839   *<S {Clo}.> Nay, I shall nere be ware of mine owne wit, till
840    I breake my shins against it.
841    <S {Ros}.> {Ioue}, {Ioue}, this Shepherds passion,
842    Is much vpon my fashion.
843   *<S {Clo}.> And mine, but it growes something stale with
844    mee.
845    <S {Cel}.> I pray you, one of you question yon'd man,
846    If he for gold will giue vs any foode,
847    I faint almost to death.
848    <S {Clo}.> Holla; you Clowne.
849    <S {Ros}.> Peace foole, he's not thy kinsman.
850    <S {Cor}.> Who cals?
851    <S {Clo}.> Your betters Sir.
852    <S {Cor}.> Else are they very wretched.
      <P Q6v><C B>
853    <S {Ros}.> Peace I say; good euen to your friend.
854    <S {Cor}.> And to you gentle Sir, and to you all.
855    <S {Ros}.> I prethee Shepheard, if that loue or gold
856    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
857    Bring vs where we may rest our selues, and feed:
858    Here's a yong maid with trauaile much oppressed,
859    And faints for succour.
860    <S {Cor}.> Faire Sir, I pittie her,
861    And wish for her sake more then for mine owne,
862    My fortunes were more able to releeue her:
863    But I am shepheard to another man,
864    And do not sheere the Fleeces that I graze:
865    My master is of churlish disposition,
866    And little wreakes to finde the way to heauen
867    By doing deeds of hospitalitie.
868    Besides his Coate, his Flockes, and bounds of feede
869    Are now on sale, and at our sheep- coat now
870    By reason of his absence there is nothing
871    That you will feed on: but what is, come see,
872    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
873   *<S {Ros}.> What is he that shall buy his flocke and pasture?
874   *<S {Cor}.> That yong Swaine that you saw heere but ere-while,
875   _
876    That little cares for buying any thing.
877    <S {Ros}.> I pray thee, if it stand with honestie,
878    Buy thou the Cottage, pasture, and the flocke,
879    And thou shalt haue to pay for it of vs.
880    <S {Cel}.> And we will mend thy wages:
881    I like this place, and willingly could
882    Waste my time in it.
883    <S {Cor}.> Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
884    Go with me, if you like vpon report,
885    The soile, the profit, and this kinde of life,
886    I will your very faithfull Feeder be,
887    And buy it with your Gold right sodainly.  <D {Exeunt}.>

900    <S {Iaq}.> I thanke it: More, I prethee more,

902    As a Weazel suckes egges: More, I pre'thee more.
903   *<S {Amy}.> My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please
904    you.
905    <S {Iaq}.> I do not desire you to please me,
906    I do desire you to sing:
907    Come, more, another stanzo: Cal you 'em  stanzo's?
908    <S {Amy}.> What you wil Monsieur {Iaques}.
909    <S {Iaq}.> Nay, I care not for their names, they owe mee
910    nothing. Wil you sing?
911    <S {Amy}.> More at your request, then to please my selfe.
912   *<S {Iaq}.> Well then, if euer I thanke any man, Ile thanke
913   *you: but that they cal complement is like th' encounter
914   *of two dog- Apes. And when a man thankes me hartily,
915   *me thinkes I haue giuen him a penie, and he renders me
916   *the beggerly thankes. Come sing; and you that wil not

918   *<S {Amy}.> Wel, Ile end the song. Sirs, couer the while,
919   *the Duke wil drinke vnder this tree; he hath bin all this
920    day to looke you.
921    <S {Iaq}.> And I haue bin all this day to auoid him:
922    He is too disputeable for my companie:
923    I thinke of as many matters as he, but I giue
924    Heauen thankes, and make no boast of them.
925    Come, warble, come.
926    <D {Song}.  {Altogether heere}.>

933    <S {Iaq}.> Ile giue you a verse to this note,
934    That I made yesterday in despight of my Inuention.
935    <S {Amy}.> And Ile sing it.
936    <S {Amy}.> Thus it goes.

944   *<S {Iaq}.> 'Tis a Greeke inuocation, to call fools into a cir-cle.
945   *Ile go sleepe if I can: if I cannot, Ile raile against all

952    O I die for food. Heere lie I downe,
953    And measure out my graue. Farwel kinde master.
954   *<S {Orl}.> Why how now {Adam}? No greater heart in thee:
955    Liue a little, comfort a little, cheere thy selfe a little.
956    If this vncouth Forrest yeeld any thing sauage,
957    I wil either be food for it, or bring it for foode to thee:
958    Thy conceite is neerer death, then thy powers.
959    For my sake be comfortable, hold death #a while
960    At the armes end: I wil heere be with thee presently,
961    And if I bring thee not something to eate,
962    I wil giue thee leaue to die: but if thou diest
963    Before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor.
964    Wel said, thou look'st cheerely,
965    And Ile be with thee quickly: yet thou liest
966    In the bleake aire. Come, I wil beare thee
967    To some shelter, and thou shalt not die
968    For lacke of a dinner,
969    If there liue any thing in this Desert.
970    Cheerely good {Adam}.  <D {Exeunt}>

971    <Z {Scena Septima}.>
972    <D {Enter Duke Sen. & Lord, like Out- lawes}.>
973    <S {Du.Sen}.> I thinke he be transform'd into a beast,
974    For I can no where finde him, like a man.
975    <S 1.{Lord}.> My Lord, he is but euen now gone hence,
976    Heere was he merry, hearing of a Song.
977    <S {Du.Sen}.> If he compact of iarres, grow Musicall,
978    We shall haue shortly discord in the Spheares:
979    Go seeke him, tell him I would speake with him.
980    <D {Enter Iaques}.>
981    <S 1.{Lord}.> He saues my labor by his owne approach.
982   *<S {Du.Sen}.> Why how now Monsieur, what a life is this
983    That your poore friends must woe your companie,
984    What, you looke merrily.
985    <S {Iaq}.> A Foole, a foole: I met a foole i'th Forrest,
986    A motley Foole (a miserable world:)
987    As I do liue by foode, I met a foole,
988    Who laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun,
989    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes,
990    In good set termes, and yet a motley foole.
991    Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he,
992    Call me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune,
993    And then he drew a diall from his poake,
994    And looking on it, with lacke- lustre eye,
995    Sayes, very wisely, it is ten #a clocke:
996    Thus we may see (quoth he) how the world wagges:
997    'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine,
998    And after one houre more, 'twill be eleuen,
999    And so from houre to houre, we ripe, and ripe,
1000   And then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot,
1001   And thereby hangs a tale. When I did heare
1002   The motley Foole, thus morall on the time,
1003   My Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere,
1004   That Fooles should be so deepe contemplatiue:
1005   And I did laugh, sans intermission
1006   An houre by his diall. Oh noble foole,
1007   A worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare.
1008   <S {Du.Sen}.> What foole is this?
1009  *<S {Iaq}.> O worthie Foole: One that hath bin a Courtier
1010   And sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire,
1011   They haue the gift to know it: and in his braine,
1012   Which is as drie as the remainder bisket
1013   After a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd
1014   With obseruation, the which he vents
1015   In mangled formes. O that I were a foole,
1016   I am ambitious for a motley coat.
1017   <S {Du.Sen}.> Thou shalt haue one.
1018   <S {Iaq}.> It is my onely suite,
1019   Prouided that you weed your better iudgements
1020   Of all opinion that growes ranke in them,
1021   That I am wise. I must haue liberty
1022   Withall, as large a Charter as the winde,
1023   To blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue:
1024   And they that are most gauled with my folly,
1025   They most must laugh: And #why sir must they so?
1026   The #why is plaine, as way to Parish Church:
1027   Hee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit,
1028   Doth very foolishly, although he smart
1029   Seeme senselesse of the bob. If not,
1030   The Wise- mans folly is anathomiz'd
1031   Euen by the squandring glances of the foole.
1032   Inuest me in my motley: Giue me leaue
1033   To speake my minde, and I will through and through
1034   Cleanse the foule bodie of th' infected  world,
1035   If they will patiently receiue my medicine.
1036  *<S {Du.Sen}.> Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do.
1037   <S {Iaq}.> What, for a Counter, would I do, but good?
1038   <S {Du.Sen}.> Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin:
1039   For thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine,
1040   As sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe,
1041   And all th' imbossed  sores, and headed euils,
1042   That thou with license of free foot hast caught,
1043   Would'st thou disgorge into the generall world.
1044   <S {Iaq}.> Why who cries out on pride,
1045   That can therein taxe any priuate party:
1046   Doth it not flow as hugely as the Sea,
1047   Till that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe.
1048   What woman in the Citie do I name,
1049   When that I say the City woman beares
1050   The cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders?
1051   Who can come in, and say that I meane her,
1052   When such a one as shee, such is her neighbor?
1053   Or what is he of basest function,
1054   That sayes his brauerie is not on my cost,
1055   Thinking that I meane him, but therein suites
1056   His folly to the mettle of my speech,
1057   There then, how then, what then, let me see wherein
1058   My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
1059   Then he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free,
1060   Why then my taxing like a wild- goose flies
1061   Vnclaim'd of any man. But who come here?
1062   <D {Enter Orlando}.>
1063   <S {Orl}.> Forbeare, and eate no more.
1064   <S {Iaq}.> Why I haue eate none yet.
1065   <S {Orl}.> Nor shalt not, till necessity be seru'd.
1066   <S {Iaq}.> Of what kinde should this Cocke come of?
1067  *<S {Du.Sen}.> Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distres?
1068   Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
1069   That in ciuility thou seem'st so emptie?
1070   <S {Orl}.> You touch'd my veine at first, the thorny point
1071   Of bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew
1072   Of smooth ciuility: yet am I in- land bred,
1073   And know some nourture: But forbeare, I say,
1074   He dies that touches any of this fruite,
1075   Till I, and my affaires are answered.
1076   <S {Iaq}.> #And you will not be answer'd with reason,
1077   I must dye.
1078   <S {Du.Sen}.> What would you haue?
1079   Your gentlenesse shall force, more then your force
1080   Moue vs to gentlenesse.
1081   <S {Orl}.> I almost die for food, and let me haue it.
1082  *<S {Du.Sen}.> Sit downe and feed, & welcom to our table
1083   <S {Orl}.> Speake you so gently? Pardon me I pray you,
1084   I thought that all things had bin sauage heere,
1085   And therefore put I on the countenance
1086   Of sterne command'ment. But what ere you are
1087   That in this desert inaccessible,
1088   Vnder the shade of melancholly boughes,
1089   Loose, and neglect the creeping houres of time:
1090   If euer you haue look'd on better dayes:
1091   If euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church:
1092   If euer sate at any good mans feast:
1093   If euer from your eye- lids wip'd a teare,
1094   And know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied:
1095   Let gentlenesse my strong enforcement be,
1096   In the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword.
      <P R1v>
1097  *<S {Du.Sen}.> True is it, that we haue seene better dayes,
1098   And haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church,
1099   And sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies
1100   Of drops, that sacred pity hath engendred:
1101   And therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse,
1102   And take vpon command, what helpe we haue
1103   That to your wanting may be ministred.
1104   <S {Orl}.> Then but forbeare your food a little while:
1105   Whiles (like a #Doe) I go to finde my Fawne,
1106   And giue it food. There is an old poore man,
1107   Who after me, hath many a weary steppe
1108   Limpt in pure loue: till he be first suffic'd,
1109   Opprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger,
1110   I will not touch a bit.
1111   <S {Duke} {Sen}.> Go finde him out,
1112   And we will nothing waste till you returne.
1113  *<S {Orl}.> I thanke ye, and be blest for your good comfort.
1114   <S {Du.Sen}.> Thou seest, we are not all alone vnhappie:
1115   This wide and vniuersall Theater
1116   Presents more wofull Pageants then the Sceane
1117   Wherein we play in.
1118   <S {Ia}.> All the world's a stage,
1119   And all the men and women, meerely Players;
1120   They haue their {Exits} and their Entrances,
1121   And one man in his time playes many parts,
1122   His Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant,
1123   Mewling, and puking in the Nurses armes:
1124   Then, the whining Schoole- boy with his Satchell
1125   And shining morning face, creeping like snaile
1126   Vnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer,
1127   Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad
1128   Made to his Mistresse eye- brow. Then, a Soldier,
1129   Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard,
1130   Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell,
1131   Seeking the bubble Reputation
1132   Euen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice
1133   In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd,
1134   With eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut,
1135   Full of wise sawes, and moderne instances,
1136   And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts
1137   Into the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone,
1138   With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,
1139   His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide,
1140   For his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice,
1141   Turning againe toward childish trebble pipes,
1142   And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all,
1143   That ends this strange euentfull historie,
1144   Is second childishnesse, and meere obliuion,
1145   Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.
1146   <D {Enter Orlando with Adam}.>
1147  *<S {Du.Sen}.> Welcome: set downe your venerable bur-then,
1148   and let him feede.
1149   <S {Orl}.> I thanke you most for him.
1150   <S {Ad}.> So had you neede,
1151   I scarce can speake to thanke you for my selfe.
1152  *<S {Du.Sen}.> Welcome, fall #too: I wil not trouble you,
1153   As yet to question you about your fortunes:
1154   Giue vs some Musicke, and good Cozen, sing.
1155   <D Song.>
1156   {Blow, blow, thou winter winde},
1157   {Thou art not so vnkinde, as mans ingratitude}
1158   {Thy tooth is not so keene, because thou art not seene},
1159   {although thy breath be rude}.
1160   {Heigh ho, sing heigh ho, vnto the greene holly},
1161   {Most frendship, is fayning; most Louing, meere folly:}
1162   {The heigh ho, the holly},
1163   {This Life is most iolly}.
1164   {Freize, freize, thou bitter skie that dost not bight so nigh}
1165   {as benefitts forgot:}
1166   {Though thou the waters warpe, thy sting is not so sharpe},
1167   {as freind remembred not}.
1168   {Heigh ho, sing, &c}.
1169  *<S {Duke} {Sen}.> If that you were the good Sir {Rowlands} son,
1170   As you haue whisper'd faithfully you were,
1171   And as mine eye doth his effigies witnesse,
1172   Most truly limn'd, and liuing in your face,
1173   Be truly welcome hither: I am the Duke
1174   That lou'd your Father, the residue of your fortune,
1175   Go to my Caue, and tell mee. Good old man,
1176   Thou art right welcome, as thy masters is:
1177   Support him by the arme: giue me your hand,
1178   And let me all your fortunes vnderstand.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1179   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1180   <D {Enter Duke, Lords, & Oliuer}.>
1181   <S {Du}.> Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
1182   But were I not the better part made mercie,
1183   I should not seeke an absent argument
1184   Of my reuenge, thou present: but looke to it,
1185   Finde out thy brother wheresoere he is,
1186   Seeke him with Candle: bring him dead, or liuing
1187   Within this tweluemonth, or turne thou no more
1188   To seeke a liuing in our Territorie.
1189   Thy Lands and all things that thou dost call thine,
1190   Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands,
1191   Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth,
1192   Of what we thinke against thee.
1193   <S {Ol}.> Oh that your Highnesse knew my heart in this:
1194   I neuer lou'd my brother in my life.
1195  *<S {Duke}.> More villaine thou. Well push him out of dores
1196   And let my officers of such a nature
1197   Make an extent vpon his house and Lands:
1198   Do this expediently, and turne him going.  <D {Exeunt}>
1199   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1200   <D {Enter Orlando}.>
1201   <S {Orl}.> Hang there my verse, in witnesse of my loue,
1202   And thou thrice crowned Queene of night suruey
1203   With thy chaste eye, from thy pale spheare aboue
1204   Thy Huntresse name, that my full life doth sway.
1205   O {Rosalind}, these Trees shall be my Bookes,
1206   And in their barkes my thoughts Ile charracter,
1207   That euerie eye, which in this Forrest lookes,
1208   Shall see thy vertue witnest euery where.
1209   Run, run {Orlando}, carue on euery Tree,
1210   The faire, the chaste, and vnexpressiue shee.  <D {Exit}>
1211   <D {Enter Corin & Clowne}.>
1212  *<S {Co}.> And how like you this shepherds life Mr {Touchstone}?
      <P R2>
1213  *<S {Clow}.> Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a
1214  *good life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is
1215  *naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well:
1216  *but in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now
1217  *in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in
1218  *respect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare
1219  *life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no
1220  *more plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke.
1221   #Has't any Philosophie in thee shepheard?
1222  *<S {Cor}.> No more, but that I know the more one sickens,
1223  *the worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money,
1224  *meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That
1225  *the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That
1226  *good pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of
1227  *the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath lear-ned
1228  *no wit by Nature, nor #Art, may complaine of good
1229   breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.
1230   <S {Clo}.> Such a one is a naturall Philosopher:
1231   #Was't euer in Court, Shepheard?
1232   <S {Cor}.> No truly.
1233   <S {Clo}.> Then thou art damn'd.
1234   <S {Cor}.> Nay, I hope.
1235  *<S {Clo}.> Truly thou art damn'd, like an #ill roasted Egge,
1236   all on one side.
1237   <S {Cor}.> For not being at Court? your reason.
1238  *<S {Clo}.> Why, if thou neuer was't at Court, thou neuer
1239  *saw'st good manners: if thou neuer saw'st good maners,
1240  *then thy manners must be wicked, and wickednes is sin,
1241  *and sinne is damnation: Thou art in a parlous state shep-heard.
1242  _
1243  *<S {Cor}.> Not a whit {Touchstone}, those that are good ma-ners
1244  *at the Court, are as ridiculous in the Countrey, as
1245  *the behauiour of the Countrie is most mockeable at the
1246  *Court. You told me, you salute not at the Court, but
1247  *you kisse your hands; that courtesie would be vncleanlie
1248   if Courtiers were shepheards.
1249   <S {Clo}.> Instance, briefly: come, instance.
1250  *<S {Cor}.> Why we are still handling our Ewes, and their
1251   Fels you know are greasie.
1252  *<S {Clo}.> Why do not your Courtiers hands sweate? and
1253  *is not the grease of a Mutton, as wholesome as the sweat
1254  *of a man? Shallow, shallow: A better instance I say:
1255   Come.
1256   <S {Cor}.> Besides, our hands are hard.
1257  *<S {Clo}.> Your lips wil feele them the sooner. Shallow a-gen:
1258   a more sounder instance, come.
1259  *<S {Cor}.> And they are often tarr'd ouer, with the surgery
1260  *of our sheepe: and would you haue vs kisse Tarre? The
1261   Courtiers hands are perfum'd with Ciuet.
1262  *<S {Clo}.> Most shallow man: Thou wormes meate in re-spect
1263  *of a good peece of flesh indeed: learne of the wise
1264  *and perpend: Ciuet is of a baser birth then Tarre, the
1265  *verie vncleanly fluxe of a Cat. Mend the instance Shep-heard.
1266  _
1267   <S {Cor}.> You haue too Courtly a wit, for me, Ile rest.
1268  *<S {Clo}.> Wilt thou rest damn'd? God helpe thee shallow
1269   man: God make incision in thee, thou art raw.
1270  *<S {Cor}.> Sir, I am a true Labourer, I earne that I eate: get
1271  *that I weare; owe no man hate, enuie no mans happi-nesse:
1272  *glad of other mens good content with my harme:
1273  *and the greatest of my pride, is to see my Ewes graze, &
1274   my Lambes sucke.
1275  *<S {Clo}.> That is another simple sinne in you, to bring the
1276  *Ewes and the Rammes together, and to offer to get your
1277  *liuing, by the copulation of Cattle, to be bawd to a Bel-weather,
1278  *and to betray a shee- Lambe of a tweluemonth
1279  *to a crooked- pated olde Cuckoldly Ramme, out of all
1280  *reasonable match. If thou bee'st not damn'd for this, the
1281  *diuell himselfe will haue no shepherds, I cannot see else
1282   how thou shouldst scape.
1283  *<S {Cor}.> Heere comes yong Mr {Ganimed}, my new Mistris-ses
1284   Brother.

1311  *This is the verie false gallop of Verses, why doe you in-fect
1312   your selfe with them?
1313   <S {Ros}.> Peace you dull foole, I found them on a tree.
1314   <S {Clo}.> Truely the tree yeelds bad fruite.
1315  *<S {Ros}.> Ile graffe it with you, and then I shall graffe it
1316  *with a Medler: then it will be the earliest fruit i'th coun-try:
1317  *for you'l be rotten ere you bee halfe ripe, and that's
1318   the right vertue of the Medler.
1319  *<S {Clo}.> You haue said: but whether wisely or no, let the
1320   Forrest iudge.

1355   neuer cri'de, haue patience good people.
1356  *<S {Cel}.> How now backe friends: Shepheard, go off a lit-tle:
1357   go with him sirrah.
1358  *<S {Clo}.> Come Shepheard, let vs make an honorable re-treit,
1359  *though not with bagge and baggage, yet with
1360   scrip and scrippage.  <D {Exit}.>
1361   <S {Cel}.> Didst thou heare these verses?
1362  *<S {Ros}.> O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some
1363  *of them had in them more feete then the Verses would
1364   beare.
1365  *<S {Cel}.> That's no matter: the feet might beare y verses.
1366  *<S {Ros}.> #I, but the feet were lame, and could not beare
1367  *themselues without the verse, and therefore stood lame-ly
1368   in the verse.
1369  *<S {Cel}.> But didst thou heare without wondering, how
1370  *thy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees?
1371  *<S {Ros}.> I was seuen of the nine daies out of the wonder,
1372  *before you came: for looke heere what I found on a
1373  *Palme tree; I was neuer so berim'd since {Pythagoras} time
1374   that I was an Irish Rat, which I can hardly remember.
1375   <S {Cel}.> Tro you, who hath done this?
1376   <S {Ros}.> Is it a man?
1377  *<S {Cel}.> And a chaine that you once wore about his neck:
1378   change you colour?
1379   <S {Ros}.> I pre'thee who?
1380  *<S {Cel}.> O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to
1381  *meete; but Mountaines may bee remoou'd with Earth-quakes,
1382   and so encounter.
1383   <S {Ros}.> Nay, but who is it?
1384   <S {Cel}.> Is it possible?
1385  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, I pre'thee now, with most petitionary ve-hemence,
1386   tell me who it is.
1387  *<S {Cel}.> O wonderfull, wonderfull, and most wonderfull
1388  *wonderfull, and yet againe wonderful, and after that out
1389   of all hooping.
1390  *<S {Ros}.> Good my complection, dost thou think though
1391  *I am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in
1392  *my disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South- sea
1393  *of discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and
1394  *speake apace: I would thou couldst stammer, that thou
1395  *might'st powre this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as
1396  *Wine comes out of a narrow- mouth'd bottle: either too
1397  *much at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke
1398   out of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings.
1399   <S {Cel}.> So you may put a man in your belly.
1400  *<S {Ros}.> Is he of Gods making? What manner of man?
1401   Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?
1402   <S {Cel}.> Nay, he hath but a little beard.
1403  *<S {Ros}.> Why God will send more, if the man will bee
1404  *thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou
1405   delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
1406  *<S {Cel}.> It is yong {Orlando}, that tript vp the Wrastlers
1407   heeles, and your heart, both in an instant.
1408  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, but the diuell take mocking: speake sadde
1409   brow, and true maid.
1410   <S {Cel}.> I'faith (Coz) tis he.
1411   <S {Ros}.> {Orlando}?
1412   <S {Cel}.> {Orlando}.
1413  *<S {Ros}.> Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet &
1414  *hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What sayde
1415  *he? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes hee
1416  *heere? Did he aske for me? Where remaines he? How
1417  *parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him a-gaine?
1418   Answer me in one word.
1419  *<S {Cel}.> You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first:
1420  *'tis a Word too great for any mouth of this Ages size, to
1421  *say #I and no, to these particulars, is more then to answer
1422   in a Catechisme.
1423  *<S {Ros}.> But doth he know that I am in this Forrest, and
1424  *in mans apparrell? Looks he as freshly, as he did the day
1425   he Wrastled?
1426  *<S {Cel}.> It is as easie to count Atomies as to resolue the
1427  *propositions of a Louer: but take a taste of my finding
1428  *him, and rellish it with good obseruance. I found him
1429   vnder a tree like a drop'd Acorne.
1430  *<S {Ros}.> It may wel be cal'd Ioues tree, when it droppes
1431   forth fruite.
1432   <S {Cel}.> Giue me audience, good Madam.
1433   <S {Ros}.> Proceed.
1434  *<S {Cel}.> There lay hee stretch'd along like a Wounded
1435   knight.
1436  *<S {Ros}.> Though it be pittie to see such a sight, it well
1437   becomes the ground.
1438  *<S {Cel}.> Cry holla, to the tongue, I prethee: it curuettes
1439   vnseasonably. He was furnish'd like a Hunter.
1440   <S {Ros}.> O ominous, he comes to kill my Hart.
1441  *<S {Cel}.> I would sing my song without a burthen, thou
1442   bring'st me out of tune.
1443  *<S {Ros}.> Do you not know I am a woman, when I thinke,
1444   I must speake: sweet, say on.
1445   <D {Enter Orlando & Iaques}.>
1446   <S {Cel}.> You bring me out. Soft, comes he not heere?
1447   <S {Ros}.> 'Tis he, slinke by, and note him.
1448  *<S {Iaq}.> I thanke you for your company, but good faith
1449   I had as liefe haue beene my selfe alone.
1450   <S {Orl}.> And so had I: but yet for fashion sake
1451   I thanke you too, for your societie.
1452   <S {Iaq}.> God buy you, let's meet as little as we can.
1453   <S {Orl}.> I do desire we may be better strangers.
1454  *<S {Iaq}.> I pray you marre no more trees with Writing
1455   Loue- songs in their barkes.
1456  *<S {Orl}.> I pray you marre no moe of my verses with rea-ding
1457   them ill- fauouredly.
1458   <S {Iaq}.> {Rosalinde} is your loues name? <S {Orl}.> Yes, Iust.
1459   <S {Iaq}.> I do not like her name.
1460  *<S {Orl}.> There was no thought of pleasing you when she
1461   was christen'd.
1462   <S {Iaq}.> What stature is she of?
1463   <S {Orl}.> Iust as high as my heart.
1464  *<S {Iaq}.> You are ful of prety answers: haue you not bin ac-quainted
1465  *with goldsmiths wiues, & cond the[m] out of rings
1466  *<S {Orl}.> Not so: but I answer you right painted cloath,
1467   from whence you haue studied your questions.
1468  *<S {Iaq}.> You haue a nimble wit; I thinke 'twas made of
1469  *{Attalanta's} heeles. Will you sitte downe with me, and
1470  *wee two, will raile against our Mistris the world, and all
1471   our miserie.
1472  *<S {Orl}.> I wil chide no breather in the world but my selfe
      <P R3>
1473   against whom I know most faults.
1474   <S {Iaq}.> The worst fault you haue, is to be in loue.
1475   <S {Orl}.> 'Tis a fault I will not change, for your best ver-tue:
1476   I am wearie of you.
1477  *<S {Iaq}.> By my troth, I was seeking for a Foole, when I
1478   found you.
1479  *<S {Orl}.> He is drown'd in the brooke, looke but in, and
1480   you shall see him.
1481   <S {Iaq}.> There I shal see mine owne figure.
1482   <S {Orl}.> Which I take to be either a foole, or a Cipher.
1483  *<S {Iaq}.> Ile tarrie no longer with you, farewell good sig-nior
1484   Loue.
1485  *<S {Orl}.> I am glad of your departure: Adieu good Mon-sieur
1486   Melancholly.
1487  *<S {Ros}.> I wil speake to him like a sawcie Lacky, and vn-der
1488  *that habit play the knaue with him, do you hear For-|(rester.
1489   <S {Orl}.> Verie wel, what would you?
1490   <S {Ros}.> I pray you, what i'st #a clocke?
1491  *<S {Orl}.> You should aske me what time o' day:  there's no
1492   clocke in the Forrest.
1493  *<S {Ros}.> Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else
1494  *sighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold
1495   detect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke.
1496  *<S {Orl}.> And why not the swift foote of time? Had not
1497   that bin as proper?
1498  *<S {Ros}.> By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces,
1499  *with diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles with-all,
1500  *who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal,
1501   and who he stands stil withall.
1502   <S {Orl}.> I prethee, who doth he trot withal?
1503  *<S {Ros}.> Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between
1504  *the contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd:
1505  *if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard,
1506   that it seemes the length of seuen yeare.
1507   <S {Orl}.> Who ambles Time withal?
1508  *<S {Ros}.> With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man
1509  *that hath not the Gowt: for the one sleepes easily be-cause
1510  *he cannot study, and the other liues merrily, be-cause
1511  *he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of
1512  *leane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no bur-then
1513  *of heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles
1514   withal.
1515   <S {Orl}.> Who doth he gallop withal?
1516  *<S {Ros}.> With a theefe to the gallowes: for though hee
1517  *go as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon
1518   there.
1519   <S {Orl}.> Who staies it stil withal?
1520  *<S {Ros}.> With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe
1521  *betweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not
1522   how time moues.
1523   <S {Orl}.> Where dwel you prettie youth?
1524  *<S {Ros}.> With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the
1525   skirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat.
1526   <S {Orl}.> Are you natiue of this place?
1527  *<S {Ros}.> As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is
1528   kindled.
1529  *<S {Orl}.> Your accent is something finer, then you could
1530   purchase in so remoued a dwelling.
1531  *<S {Ros}.> I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an  olde
1532  *religious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was
1533  *in his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too
1534  *well: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read ma-ny
1535  *Lectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Wo-man
1536  *to be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee
1537   hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
1538  *<S {Orl}.> Can you remember any of the principall euils,
1539   that he laid to the charge of women?
1540  *<S {Ros}.> There were none principal, they were all like
1541  *one another, as halfepence are, euerie one fault seeming
1542   monstrous, til his fellow- fault came to match it.
1543   <S {Orl}.> I prethee recount some of them.
1544  *<S {Ros}.> No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those
1545  *that are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that a-buses
1546  *our yong plants with caruing {Rosalinde} on their
1547  *barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on
1548  *brambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of {Rosalinde}.
1549  *If I could meet that Fancie- monger, I would giue him
1550  *some good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian
1551   of Loue vpon him.
1552  *<S {Orl}.> I am he that is so Loue- shak'd, I pray you tel
1553   me your remedie.
1554  *<S {Ros}.> There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you:
1555  *he taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage
1556   of rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner.
1557   <S {Orl}.> What were his markes?
1558  *<S {Ros}.> A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie
1559  *and sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spi-rit,
1560  *which you haue not: a beard neglected, which you
1561  *haue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your ha-uing
1562  *in beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your
1563  *hose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your
1564  *sleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing
1565  *about you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you
1566  *are no such man; you are rather point deuice in your ac-coustrements,
1567  *as louing your selfe, then seeming the Lo-uer
1568   of any other.
1569  *<S {Orl}.> Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue |(I Loue.
1570  *<S {Ros}.> Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that
1571  *you Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do,
1572  *then to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the
1573  *which women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But
1574  *in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the
1575   Trees, wherein  {Rosalind} is so admired?
1576  *<S {Orl}.> I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of
1577   {#Rosalind}, I am that #he, that vnfortunate he.
1578  *<S {Ros}.> But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak?
1579  *<S {Orl}.> Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much.
1580  *<S {Ros}.> Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, de-serues
1581  *as wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do:
1582  *and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is
1583  *that the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in
1584   loue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel.
1585   <S {Orl}.> Did you euer cure any so?
1586  *<S {Ros}.> Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to ima-gine
1587  *me his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day
1588  *to woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish
1589  *youth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and
1590  *liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful
1591  *of teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and
1592  *for no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are
1593  *for the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like
1594  *him, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear
1595  *him: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue
1596  *my Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor
1597  *of madnes, w was to forsweare the ful stream of y world,
1598  *and to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd
1599  *him, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Li-uer
1600  *as cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not
1601   be one spot of Loue in't.
1602   <S {Orl}.> I would not be cured, youth.
1603  *<S {Ros}.> I would cure you, if you would but call me {Rosa-lind},
1604   and come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me.
      <P R3v>
1605  *<S {Orlan}.> Now by the faith of my loue, I will; Tel me
1606   where it is.
1607  *<S {Ros}.> Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by
1608  *the way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue:
1609   Wil you go?
1610   <S {Orl}.> With all my heart, good youth.
1611  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, you must call mee {Rosalind}: Come sister,
1612   will you go?  <D {Exeunt}.>
1613   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
1614   <D {Enter Clowne, Audrey, & Iaques}.>
1615  *<S {Clo}.> Come apace good {Audrey}, I wil fetch vp your
1616  *Goates, {Audrey}: and how {Audrey} am I the man yet?
1617   Doth my simple feature content you?
1618  *<S {Aud}.> Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features?
1619  *<S {Clo}.> I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most
1620   capricious Poet honest {Ouid} was among the Gothes.
1621  *<S {Iaq}.> O knowledge #ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in
1622   a thatch'd house.
1623  *<S {Clo}.> When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor
1624  *a mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vn-derstanding:
1625  *it strikes a man more dead then a great rec-koning
1626  *in a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde
1627   made thee poeticall.
1628  *<S {Aud}.> I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in
1629   deed and word: is it a true thing?
1630  *<S {Clo}.> No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most fai-ning,
1631  *and Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they
1632  *sweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne.
1633  *<S {Aud}.> Do you wish then that the Gods had made me
1634   Poeticall?
1635  *<S {Clow}.> I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art ho-nest:
1636  *Now if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope
1637   thou didst feigne.
1638   <S {Aud}.> Would you not haue me honest?
1639  *<S {Clo}.> No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for
1640  *honestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to
1641   Sugar.
1642   <S {Iaq}.> A materiall foole.
1643  *<S {Aud}.> Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the
1644   Gods make me honest.
1645  *<S {Clo}.> Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule
1646   slut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish.
1647  *<S {Aud}.> I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I
1648   am foule.
1649  *<S {Clo}.> Well, praised be the Gods, for thy foulnesse; slut-tishnesse
1650  *may come heereafter. But be it, as it may bee,
1651  *I wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir
1652  *{#Oliuer Mar- text}, the Vicar of the next village, who hath
1653  *promis'd to meete me in this place of the Forrest, and to
1654   couple vs.
1655   <S {Iaq}.> I would faine see this meeting.
1656   <S {Aud}.> Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy.
1657  *<S {Clo}.> Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart,
1658  *stagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple
1659  *but the wood, no assembly but horne- beasts. But what
1660  *though? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are neces-sarie.
1661  *It is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods;
1662  *right: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end
1663  *of them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none
1664  *of his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone:
1665  *No, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Ras-call:
1666  *Is the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd
1667  *Towne is more worthier then a village, so is the fore-head
1668  *of a married man, more honourable then the bare
1669  *brow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is bet-ter
1670  *then no skill, by so much is a horne more precious
1671   then to want.
1672   <D {Enter Sir Oliuer Mar- text}.>
1673  *Heere comes Sir {Oliuer}: Sir {Oliuer Mar- text} you are
1674  *wel met. Will you dispatch vs heere vnder this tree, or
1675   shal we go with you to your Chappell?
1676   <S {Ol}.> Is there none heere to giue the woman?
1677   <S {Clo}.> I wil not take her on guift of any man.
1678  *<S {Ol}.> Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not
1679   lawfull.
1680   <S {Iaq}.> Proceed, proceede: Ile giue her.
1681  *<S {Clo}.> Good euen good Mr what ye cal't: how do you
1682  *Sir, you are verie well met: goddild you for your last
1683  *companie, I am verie glad to see you, euen a toy in hand
1684   heere Sir: Nay, pray be couer'd.
1685   <S {Iaq}.> Wil you be married, Motley?
1686  *<S {Clo}.> As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb,
1687  *and the Falcon her bels, so man hath his desires, and as
1688   Pigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling.
1689  *<S {Iaq}.> And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be
1690  *married vnder a bush like a begger? Get you to church,
1691  *and haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is,
1692  *this fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne
1693  *Wainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell,
1694   and like greene timber, warpe, warpe.
1695  *<S {Clo}.> I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee
1696  *married of him then of another, for he is not like to mar-rie
1697  *me wel: and not being wel married, it wil be a good
1698   excuse for me heereafter, to leaue my wife.
1699   <S {Iaq}.> Goe thou with mee,
1700   And let me counsel thee.
1701   <S {Ol}.> Come sweete {Audrey},
1702   We must be married, or we must liue in baudrey:
1703  *Farewel good Mr {Oliuer}: Not O sweet {Oliuer}, O braue
1704  *{#Oliuer} leaue me not behind thee: But winde away, bee
1705   gone I say, I wil not to wedding with thee.
1706  *<S {Ol}.> 'Tis no matter; Ne're a fantastical knaue of them
1707   all shal flout me out of my calling.  <D {Exeunt}>
1708   <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
1709   <D {Enter Rosalind & Celia}.>
1710   <S {Ros}.> Neuer talke to me, I wil weepe.
1711  *<S {Cel}.> Do I prethee, but yet haue the grace to consider,
1712   that teares do not become a man.
1713   <S {Ros}.> But haue I not cause to weepe?
1714   <S {Cel}.> As good cause as one would desire,
1715   Therefore weepe.
1716   <S {Ros}.> His very haire
1717   Is of the dissembling colour.
1718   <S {Cel}.> Something browner then Iudasses:
1719   Marrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children.
1720   <S {Ros}.> I'faith his haire is of a good colour.
1721   <S {Cel}.> An excellent colour:
1722   Your Chessenut was euer the onely colour:
1723   <S {Ros}.> And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie,
1724   As the touch of holy bread.
      <P R4><C C>
1725  *<S {Cel}.> Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of {Diana}: a
1726  *Nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie,
1727   the very yce of chastity is in them.
1728  *<S {Rosa}.> But why did hee sweare hee would come this
1729   morning, and comes not?
1730   <S {Cel}.> Nay certainly there is no truth in him.
1731   <S {Ros}.> Doe you thinke so?
1732  *<S {Cel}.> Yes, I thinke he is not a picke purse, nor a horse- stealer,
1733  *but for his verity in loue, I doe thinke him as
1734   concaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme- eaten nut.
1735   <S {Ros}.> Not true in loue?
1736   <S {Cel}.> Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he #is not in.
1737  *<S {Ros}.> You haue heard him sweare downright he #was.
1738  *<S {Cel}.> #Was, is not #is: besides, the oath of Louer is no
1739  *stronger then the word of a Tapster, they are both the
1740  *confirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the for-rest
1741   on the Duke your father.
1742  *<S {Ros}.> I met the Duke yesterday, and had much que-stion
1743  *with him: he askt me of what parentage I was; I
1744  *told him of as good as he, so he laugh'd and let mee goe.
1745  *But what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man
1746   as {Orlando}?
1747  *<S {Cel}.> O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses,
1748  *speakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes
1749  *them brauely, quite trauers athwart the heart of his lo-uer,
1750  *as a puisny Tilter, y spurs his horse but on one side,
1751  *breakes his staffe like a noble goose; but all's braue that
1752   youth mounts, and folly guides: who comes heere?
1753   <D {Enter Corin}.>
1754  *<S {Corin}.> Mistresse and Master, you haue oft enquired
1755   After the Shepheard that complain'd of loue,
1756   Who you saw sitting by me on the Turph,
1757   Praising the proud disdainfull Shepherdesse
1758   That was his Mistresse.
1759   <S {Cel}.> Well: and what of him?
1760   <S {Cor}.> If you will see a pageant truely plaid
1761   Betweene the pale complexion of true Loue,
1762   And the red glowe of scorne and prowd disdaine,
1763   Goe hence a little, and I shall conduct you
1764   If you will marke it.
1765   <S {Ros}.> O come, let vs remoue,
1766   The sight of Louers feedeth those in loue:
1767   Bring vs to this sight, and you shall say
1768   Ile proue a busie actor in their play.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1769   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
1770   <D {Enter Siluius and Phebe}.>
1771   <S {Sil}.> Sweet {Phebe} doe not scorne me, do not {Phebe}
1772   Say that you loue me not, but say not so
1773   In bitternesse; the common executioner
1774   Whose heart th' accustom'd  sight of death makes hard
1775   Falls not the axe vpon the humbled neck,
1776   But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
1777   Then he that dies and liues by bloody drops?
1778   <D {Enter Rosalind, Celia, and Corin}.>
1779   <S {Phe}.> I would not be thy executioner,
1780   I flye thee, for I would not iniure thee:
1781   Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye,
1782   'Tis pretty sure, and very probable,
1783   That eyes that are the frailst, and softest things,
1784   Who shut their coward gates on atomyes,
1785   Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers.
1786   Now I doe frowne on thee with all my heart,
1787   And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
1788   Now counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe,
1789   Or if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame,
1790   Lye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers:
1791   Now shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee,
1792   Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines
1793   Some scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush
1794   The Cicatrice and capable impressure
1795   Thy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes
1796   Which I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not,
1797   Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
1798   That can doe hurt.
1799   <S {Sil}.> O deere {Phebe},
1800   If euer (as that euer may be neere)
1801   You meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie,
1802   Then shall you know the wounds inuisible
1803   That Loues keene arrows make.
1804   <S {Phe}.> But till that time
1805   Come not thou neere me: and when that time comes,
1806   Afflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not,
1807   As till that time I shall not pitty thee.
1808  *<S {Ros}.> And why I pray you? who might be your mother
1809   That you insult, exult, and all at once
1810   Ouer the wretched? what though you haue no beauty
1811   As by my faith, I see no more in you
1812   Then without Candle may goe darke to bed:
1813   Must you be therefore prowd and pittilesse?
1814   Why what meanes this? why do you looke on me?
1815   I see no more in you then in the ordinary
1816   Of Natures sale- worke? 'ods my little life,
1817   I thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too:
1818   No faith proud Mistresse, hope not after it,
1819   'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke silke haire,
1820   Your bugle eye- balls, nor your cheeke of creame
1821   That can entame my spirits to your worship:
1822   You foolish Shepheard, wherefore do you follow her
1823   Like foggy South, puffing with winde and raine,
1824   You are a thousand times a properer man
1825   Then she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as you
1826   That makes the world full of ill- fauourd children:
1827   'Tis not her glasse, but you that flatters her,
1828   And out of you she sees her selfe more proper
1829   Then any of her lineaments can show her:
1830   But Mistris, know your selfe, downe on your knees
1831   And thanke heauen, fasting, for a good mans loue;
1832   For I must tell you friendly in your eare,
1833   Sell when you can, you are not for all markets:
1834   Cry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer,
1835   Foule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer.
1836   So take her to thee Shepheard, fareyouwell.
1837  *<S {Phe}.> Sweet youth, I pray you chide a yere together,
1838   I had rather #here you chide, then this man wooe.
1839  *<S {Ros}.> Hees falne in loue with your foulnesse, & shee'll
1840   Fall in loue with my anger. If it be so, as fast
1841   As she answeres thee with frowning lookes, ile sauce
1842   Her with bitter words: why looke you so vpon me?
1843   <S {Phe}.> For no #ill #will I beare you.
1844   <S {Ros}.> I pray you do not fall in loue with mee,
1845   For I am falser then vowes made in wine:
1846   Besides, I like you not: if you will know my house,
1847   'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard by:
1848   Will you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard:
      <P R4v>
1849   Come Sister: Shepheardesse, looke on him better
1850   And be not proud, though all the world could see,
1851   None could be so abus'd in sight as hee.
1852   Come, to our flocke,  <D {Exit}.>
1853  *<S {Phe}.> Dead Shepheard, now I find thy saw of #might,
1854   Who euer lov'd, that lou'd not at first sight?
1855   <S {Sil}.> Sweet {Phebe}.
1856   <S {Phe}.> Hah: what saist thou {Siluius}?
1857   <S {Sil}.> Sweet {Phebe} pitty me.
1858   <S {Phe}.> Why I am sorry for thee gentle {Siluius}.
1859   <S {Sil}.> Where euer sorrow is, reliefe would be:
1860   If you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue,
1861   By giuing loue your sorrow, and my griefe
1862   Were both extermin'd.
1863   <S {Phe}.> Thou hast my loue, is not that neighbourly?
1864   <S {Sil}.> I would haue you.
1865   <S {Phe}.> Why that were couetousnesse:
1866   {Siluius}; the time was, that I hated thee;
1867   And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue,
1868   But since that thou canst talke of loue so well,
1869   Thy company, which erst was irkesome to me
1870   I will endure; and Ile employ thee too:
1871   But doe not looke for further recompence
1872   Then thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd.
1873   <S {Sil}.> So holy, and so perfect is my loue,
1874   And I in such a pouerty of grace,
1875   That I shall thinke it a most plenteous crop
1876   To gleane the broken eares after the man
1877   That the maine haruest reapes: loose now and then
1878   A scattred smile, and that Ile liue vpon.
1879  *<S {Phe}.> Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yere-|(while?
1880   <S {Sil}.> Not very well, but I haue met him oft,
1881   And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds
1882   That the old {Carlot} once was Master of.
1883   <S {Phe}.> Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,
1884   'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well,
1885   But what care I for words? yet words do well
1886   When he that speakes them pleases those that heare:
1887   It is a pretty youth, not very prettie,
1888   But sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him;
1889   Hee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
1890   Is his complexion: and faster then his tongue
1891   Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp:
1892   He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall:
1893   His leg is but #so so, and yet 'tis well:
1894   There was a pretty rednesse in his lip,
1895   A little riper, and more lustie red
1896   Then that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference
1897   Betwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske.
1898   There be some women {Siluius}, had they markt him
1899   In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere
1900   To fall in loue with him: but for my part
1901   I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet
1902   Haue more cause to hate him then to loue him,
1903   For what had he to doe to chide at me?
1904   He said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,
1905   And now I am remembred, scorn'd at me:
1906   I maruell why I answer'd not againe,
1907   But that's all one: omittance is no quittance:
1908   Ile write to him a very tanting Letter,
1909   And thou shalt beare it, wilt thou {Siluius}?
1910   <S {Sil}.> {Phebe}, with all my heart.
1911   <S {Phe}.> Ile write it strait:
1912   The matter's in my head, and in my heart,
1913   I will be bitter with him, and passing short;
1914   Goe with me {Siluius}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1915   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
1916   <D {Enter Rosalind, and Celia, and Iaques}.>
1917  *<S {Iaq}.> I prethee, pretty youth, let me better acquainted
1918   with thee.
1919   <S {Ros}> They say you are a melancholly fellow.
1920   <S {Iaq}.> I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing.
1921  *<S {Ros}.> Those that are in extremity of either, are abho-minable
1922  *fellowes, and betray themselues to euery mo-derne
1923   censure, worse then drunkards.
1924   <S {Iaq}.> Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
1925   <S {Ros}.> Why then 'tis good to be a poste.
1926  *<S {Iaq}.> I haue neither the Schollers melancholy, which
1927  *is emulation: nor the Musitians, which is fantasticall;
1928  *nor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers,
1929  *which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick:
1930  *nor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which
1931  *is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine owne, com-pounded
1932  *of many simples, extracted from many obiects,
1933  *and indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in
1934  *which by often rumination, wraps me in a most humo-rous
1935   sadnesse.
1936  *<S {Ros}.> A Traueller: by my faith you haue great rea-son
1937  *to be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands,
1938  *to see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue
1939   nothing, is to haue rich eyes and poore hands.
1940   <S {Iaq}.> Yes, I haue gain'd my experience.
1941   <D {Enter Orlando}.>
1942  *<S {Ros}.> And your experience makes you sad: I had ra-ther
1943  *haue a foole to make me merrie, then experience to
1944   make me sad, and to trauaile for it too.
1945   <S {Orl}.> Good day, and happinesse, deere {Rosalind}.
1946  *<S {Iaq}.> Nay then God buy you, #and you talke in blanke
1947   verse.
1948  *<S {Ros}.> Farewell Mounsieur Trauellor: looke you
1949  *lispe, and weare strange suites; disable all the benefits
1950  *of your owne Countrie: be out of loue with your
1951  *natiuitie, and almost chide God for making you that
1952  *countenance you are; or I will scarce thinke you haue
1953  *swam in a Gundello. Why how now {Orlando}, where
1954  *haue you bin all this while? you a louer? #and you
1955  *serue me such another tricke, neuer come in my sight
1956   more.
1957  *<S {Orl}.> My faire {Rosalind}, I come within an houre of my
1958   promise.
1959  *<S {Ros}.> Breake an houres promise in loue? hee that
1960  *will diuide a minute into a thousand parts, and breake
1961  *but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs
1962  *of loue, it may be said of him that {Cupid} hath clapt
1963   him oth' shoulder, but Ile warrant him heart hole.
1964   <S {Orl}.> Pardon me deere {Rosalind}.
1965  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, #and you be so tardie, come no more in my
1966   sight, I had as liefe be woo'd of a Snaile.
1967   <S {Orl}.> Of a Snaile?
1968  *<S {Ros}.> #I, of a Snaile: for though he comes slowly, hee
1969  *carries his house on his head; a better ioyncture I thinke
1970  *then you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie
1971   with him.
1972   <S {Orl}.> What's that?
1973  *<S {Ros}.> Why hornes: w such as you are faine to be be-holding
1974  *to your wiues for: but he comes armed in his
1975   fortune, and preuents the slander of his wife.
      <P R5>
1976  *<S {Orl}.> Vertue is no horne- maker: and my {Rosalind} is
1977   vertuous.
1978   <S {Ros}.> And I am your {Rosalind}.
1979  *<S {Cel}.> It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a {Rosa-lind}
1980   of a better leere then you.
1981  *<S {Ros}.> Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a
1982  *holy- day humor, and like enough to consent: What
1983  *would you say to me now, #and I were your verie, verie
1984   {Rosalind}?
1985   <S {Orl}.> I would kisse before I spoke.
1986  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, you were better speake first, and when you
1987  *were grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take oc-casion
1988  *to kisse: verie good Orators when they are out,
1989  *they will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs)
1990   matter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse.
1991   <S {Orl}.> How if the kisse be denide?
1992  *<S {Ros}.> Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins
1993   new matter.
1994  *<S {Orl}.> Who could be out, being before his beloued
1995   Mistris?
1996  *<S {Ros}.> Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris,
1997   or I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit.
1998   <S {Orl}.> What, of my suite?
1999  *<S {Ros}.> Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your
2000   suite:
2001   Am not I your {Rosalind}?
2002  *<S {Orl}.> I take some ioy to say you are, because I would
2003   be talking of her.
2004   <S {Ros}.> Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you.
2005   <S {Orl}.> Then in mine owne person, I die.
2006  *<S {Ros}.> No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is
2007  *almost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there
2008  *was not anie man died in his owne person ({videlicet}) in
2009  *a loue cause: {Troilous} had his braines dash'd out with a
2010  *Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before,
2011  *and he is one of the patternes of loue. {Leander}, he would
2012  *haue liu'd manie a faire yeere though {Hero} had turn'd
2013  *Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer- night, for
2014  *(good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hel-lespont,
2015  *and being taken with the crampe, was droun'd,
2016  *and the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was
2017  *{Hero} of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died
2018  *from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not
2019   for loue.
2020  *<S {Orl}.> I would not haue my right {Rosalind} of this mind,
2021   for I protest her frowne might kill me.
2022  *<S {Ros}.> By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come,
2023  *now I will be your {Rosalind} in a more comming- on dis-position:
2024   and aske me what you will, I will grant it.
2025   <S {Orl}.> Then loue me {Rosalind}.
2026   <S {Ros}.> Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all.
2027   <S {Orl}.> And wilt thou haue me?
2028   <S {Ros}.> #I, and twentie such.
2029   <S {Orl}.> What saiest thou?
2030   <S {Ros}.> Are you not good?
2031   <S {Orl}.> I hope so.
2032  *<S {Rosalind}.> Why then, can one desire too much of a
2033  *good thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and
2034  *marrie vs: giue me your hand {Orlando}: What doe you
2035   say sister?
2036   <S {Orl}.> Pray thee marrie vs.
2037   <S {Cel}.> I cannot say the words.
2038   <S {Ros}.> You must begin, will you {Orlando}.
2039  *<S {Cel}.> Goe #too: wil you {Orlando}, haue to wife this {Ro-salind}?
2040  _
2041   <S {Orl}.> I will.
2042   <S {Ros}.> #I, but when?
2043   <S {Orl}.> Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs.
2044  *<S {Ros}.> Then you must say, I take thee {Rosalind} for
2045   wife.
2046   <S {Orl}.> I take thee {Rosalind} for wife.
2047   <S {Ros}.> I might aske you for your Commission,
2048  *But I doe take thee {Orlando} for my husband: there's a
2049  *girle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans
2050   thought runs before her actions.
2051   <S {Orl}.> So do all thoughts, they are wing'd.
2052  *<S {Ros}.> Now tell me how long you would haue her, af-ter
2053   you haue possest her?
2054   <S {Orl}.> For euer, and a day.
2055  *<S {Ros}.> Say a day, without the euer: no, no {Orlando}, men
2056  *are Aprill when they woe, December when they wed:
2057  *Maides are #May when they are maides, but the sky chan-ges
2058  *when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of
2059  *thee, then a Barbary cocke- pidgeon ouer his hen, more
2060  *clamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new- fang-led
2061  *then an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a mon-key:
2062  *I will weepe for nothing, like {Diana} in the Foun-taine,
2063  *& I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry:
2064  *I will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd
2065   to sleepe.
2066   <S {Orl}.> But will my {Rosalind} doe so?
2067   <S {Ros}.> By my life, she will doe as I doe.
2068   <S {Orl}.> O but she is wise.
2069  *<S {Ros}.> Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this:
2070  *the wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a wo-mans
2071  *wit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and
2072  *'twill out at the key- hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the
2073   smoake out at the chimney.
2074  *<S {Orl}.> A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might
2075   say, wit whether wil't?
2076  *<S {Ros}.> Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you
2077   met your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed.
2078   <S {Orl}.> And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that?
2079  *<S {Rosa}.> Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you
2080  *shall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take
2081  *her without her tongue: o that woman that cannot
2082  *make her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse
2083   her childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole.
2084  *<S {Orl}.> For these two houres {Rosalinde}, I wil leaue thee.
2085  *<S {Ros}.> Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres.
2086  *<S {Orl}.> I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two #a clock
2087   I will be with thee againe.
2088  *<S {Ros}.> #I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what
2089  *you would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I
2090  *thought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne
2091  *me: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two #o'
2092   clocke is your howre.
2093   <S {Orl}.> #I, sweet {Rosalind}.
2094  *<S {Ros}.> By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God
2095  *mend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dange-rous,
2096  *if you breake one iot of your promise, or come one
2097  *minute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most
2098  *patheticall breake- promise, and the most hollow louer,
2099  *and the most vnworthy of her you call {Rosalinde}, that
2100  *may bee chosen out of the grosse band of the vnfaith-full:
2101  *therefore beware my censure, and keep your pro-mise.
2102  _
2103  *<S {Orl}.> With no lesse religion, then if thou wert indeed
2104   my {Rosalind}: so adieu.
2105  *<S {Ros}.> Well, Time is the olde Iustice that examines all
2106   such offenders, and let time try: adieu.  <D {Exit}.>
2107  *<S {Cel}.> You haue simply misus'd our sexe in your loue- prate:
      <P R5v>
2108  *we must haue your doublet and hose pluckt ouer
2109  *your head, and shew the world what the bird hath done
2110   to her owne neast.
2111  *<S {Ros}.> O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou
2112  *didst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but
2113  *it cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne
2114   bottome, like the Bay of Portugall.
2115  *<S {Cel}.> Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure
2116   affection in, it runs out.
2117  *<S {Ros}.> No, that same wicked Bastard of {Venus}, that was
2118  *begot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of
2119  *madnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery
2120  *ones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge,
2121  *how deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee {Aliena}, I cannot be
2122  *out of the sight of {Orlando}: Ile goe finde a shadow, and
2123   sigh till he come.
2124   <S {Cel}.> And Ile sleepe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2125   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2126   <D {Enter Iaques and Lords, Forresters}.>
2127   <S {Iaq}.> Which is he that killed the Deare?
2128   <S {Lord}.> Sir, it was I.
2129  *<S {Iaq}.> Let's present him to the Duke like a Romane
2130  *Conquerour, and it would doe well to set the Deares
2131  *horns vpon his head, for a branch of victory; haue you
2132   no song Forrester for this purpose?
2133   <S {Lord}.> Yes Sir.
2134  *<S {Iaq}.> Sing it: 'tis no matter how it bee in tune, so it
2135   make noyse enough.
2136   <D Musicke, Song.>
2137   {What shall he haue that kild the Deare?}
2138   {His Leather skin, and hornes to weare:}
2139   {Then sing him home, the rest shall beare this burthen;}
2140   {Take thou no scorne to weare the horne},
2141   {It was a crest ere thou wast borne},
2142   {Thy fathers father wore it},
2143   {And thy father bore it},
2144   {The horne, the horne, the lusty horne},
2145   {Is not a thing to laugh to scorne}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2146   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
2147   <D {Enter Rosalind and Celia}.>
2148   <S {Ros}.> How say you now, is it not past two #a clock?
2149   And heere much {Orlando}.
2150  *<S {Cel}.> I warrant you, with pure loue, & troubled brain,
2151   <D {Enter Siluius}.>
2152   He hath t'ane his bow and arrowes, and is gone forth
2153   To sleepe: looke who comes heere.
2154   <S {Sil}.> My errand is to you, faire youth,
2155   My gentle {Phebe}, did bid me giue you this:
2156   I know not the contents, but as I guesse
2157   By the sterne brow, and waspish action
2158   Which she did vse, as she was writing of it,
2159   It beares an angry tenure; pardon me,
2160   I am but as a guiltlesse messenger.
2161   <S {Ros}.> Patience her selfe would startle at this letter,
2162   And play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all:
2163   Shee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners,
2164   She calls me proud, and that she could not loue me
2165   Were man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my #will,
2166   Her loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt,
2167   Why writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well,
2168   This is a Letter of your owne deuice.
2169   <S {Sil}.> No, I protest, I know not the contents,
2170   {Phebe} did write it.
2171   <S {Ros}.> Come, come, you are a foole,
2172   And turn'd into the extremity of loue.
2173   I saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand,
2174   A freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke
2175   That her old gloues were on, but twas her hands:
2176   She has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter:
2177   I say she neuer did inuent this letter,
2178   This is a mans inuention, and his hand.
2179   <S {Sil}.> Sure it is hers.
2180   <S {Ros}.> Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile,
2181   A stile for challengers: why, she defies me,
2182   Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine
2183   Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention,
2184   Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
2185   Then in their countenance: will you heare the letter?
2186   <S {Sil}.> So please you, for I neuer heard it yet:
2187   Yet heard too much of {Phebes} crueltie.
2188   <S {Ros}.> She {Phebes} me: marke how the tyrant writes.
2189   <D Read.> {Art thou god, to Shepherd turn'd?}
2190   {That a maidens heart hath burn'd}.
2191   Can a woman raile thus?
2192   <S {Sil}.> Call you this railing?
2193   <S {Ros}.><D Read.> {Why, thy godhead laid #a part},
2194   {War'st thou with a womans heart?}
2195   Did you euer heare such railing?
2196   {Whiles the eye of man did wooe me},
2197   {That could do no vengeance to me}.
2198   Meaning me a beast.
2199   {If the scorne of your bright eine}
2200   {Haue power to raise such loue in mine},
2201   {Alacke, in me, what strange effect}
2202   {Would they worke in milde aspect?}
2203   {Whiles you chid me, I did loue},
2204   {How then might your praiers moue?}
2205   {He that brings this loue to thee},
2206   {Little knowes this Loue in me:}
2207   {And by him seale vp thy minde},
2208   {Whether that thy youth and kinde}
2209   {#Will the faithfull offer take}
2210   {Of me, and all that I can make},
2211   {Or else by him my loue denie},
2212   {And then Ile studie how to die}.
2213   <S {Sil}.> Call you this chiding?
2214   <S {Cel}.> Alas poore Shepheard.
2215  *<S {Ros}.> Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty:
2216  *wilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an in-strument,
2217  *and play false straines vpon thee? not to be en-dur'd.
2218  *Well, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath
2219  *made thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she
2220  *loue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will
2221  *neuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a
2222  *true louer hence, and not a word; for here comes more
2223   company.  <D {Exit. Sil}.>
2224   <D {Enter Oliuer}.>
2225  *<S {Oliu}.> Good morrow, faire ones: pray you, (if you | know)
2226   Where in the Purlews of this Forrest, stands
      <P R6>
2227   A sheep- coat, fenc'd about with Oliue- trees.
2228  *<S {Cel}.> West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom
2229   The ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame
2230   Left on your right hand, brings you to the place:
2231   But at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe,
2232   There's none within.
2233   <S {Oli}.> If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
2234   Then should I know you by description,
2235   Such garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire,
2236   Of femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe
2237   Like a ripe sister: the woman low
2238   And browner then her brother: are not you
2239   The owner of the house I did enquire for?
2240   <S {Cel}.> It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
2241   <S {Oli}.> {Orlando} doth commend him to you both,
2242   And to that youth hee calls his {Rosalind},
2243   He sends this bloudy napkin; are you he?
2244   <S {Ros}.> I am: what must we vnderstand by this?
2245   <S {Oli}.> Some of my shame, if you will know of me
2246   What man I am, and how, and why, and where
2247   This handkercher was stain'd.
2248   <S {Cel}.> I pray you tell it.
2249   <S {Oli}.> When last the yong {Orlando} parted from you,
2250   He left a promise to returne againe
2251   Within an houre, and pacing through the Forrest,
2252   Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie,
2253   Loe what befell: he threw his eye aside,
2254   And marke what obiect did present it selfe
2255  *Vnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age
2256   And high top, bald with drie antiquitie:
2257   A wretched ragged man, ore- growne with haire
2258   Lay sleeping on his back; about his necke
2259   A greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe,
2260   Who with her head, nimble in threats approach'd
2261   The opening of his mouth: but sodainly
2262   Seeing {Orlando}, it vnlink'd it selfe,
2263   And with indented glides, did slip away
2264   Into a bush, vnder which bushes shade
2265   A Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie,
2266   Lay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch
2267   When that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis
2268   The royall disposition of that beast
2269   To prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead:
2270   This seene, {Orlando} did approach the man,
2271   And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
2272  *<S {Cel}.> O I haue heard him speake of that same brother,
2273   And he did render him the most vnnaturall
2274   That liu'd amongst men.
2275   <S {Oli}.> And well he might so doe,
2276   For well I know he was vnnaturall.
2277   <S {Ros}.> But to {Orlando}: did he leaue him there
2278   Food to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse?
2279   <S {Oli}.> Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so:
2280   But kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge,
2281   And Nature stronger then his iust occasion,
2282   Made him giue battell to the Lyonnesse:
2283   Who quickly fell before  him, in which hurtling
2284   From miserable slumber I awaked.
2285   <S {Cel}.> Are you his brother?
2286   <S {Ros}.> #Was't you he rescu'd?
2287  *<S {Cel}.> #Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him?
2288   <S {Oli}.> 'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame
2289   To tell you what I was, since my conuersion
2290   So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
2291   <S {Ros}.> But for the bloody napkin?
2292   <S {Oli}.> #By and by:
2293   When from the first to last betwixt vs two,
2294   Teares our recountments had most kindely bath'd,
2295   As how I came into that Desert place.
2296   In briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke,
2297   Who gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment,
2298   Committing me vnto my brothers loue,
2299   Who led me instantly vnto his Caue,
2300   There stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme
2301   The Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away,
2302   Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
2303   And cride in fainting vpon {Rosalinde}.
2304   Briefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound,
2305   And after some small space, being strong at heart,
2306   He sent me hither, stranger as I am
2307   To tell this story, that you might excuse
2308   His broken promise, and to giue this napkin
2309   Died in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth,
2310   That he in sport doth call his {Rosalind}.
2311   <S {Cel}.> Why how now {Ganimed}, sweet {Ganimed}.
2312  *<S {Oli}.> Many will swoon when they do look on bloud.
2313   <S {Cel}.> There is more in it; Cosen {Ganimed}.
2314   <S {Oli}.> Looke, he recouers.
2315   <S {Ros}.> I would I were at home.
2316   <S {Cel}.> Wee'll lead you thither:
2317   I pray you will you take him by the arme.
2318   <S {Oli}.> Be of good cheere youth: you a man?
2319   You lacke a mans heart.
2320   <S {Ros}.> I doe so, I confesse it:
2321  *Ah, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfei-ted,
2322  *I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfei-ted:
2323   heigh- ho.
2324   <S {Oli}.> This was not counterfeit, there is too great te-stimony
2325  *in your complexion, that it was a passion of ear-nest.
2326  _
2327   <S {Ros}.> Counterfeit, I assure you.
2328  *<S {Oli}.> Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
2329   be a man.
2330  *<S {Ros}.> So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a wo-man
2331   by right.
2332  *<S {Cel}.> Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw
2333   homewards: good sir, goe with vs.
2334   <S {Oli}.> That will I: for I must beare answere backe
2335   How you excuse my brother, {Rosalind}.
2336  *<S {Ros}.> I shall deuise something: but I pray you com-mend
2337   my counterfeiting to him: will you goe?
2338   <D {Exeunt}.>
2339   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2340   <D {Enter Clowne and Awdrie}.>
2341  *<S {Clow}.> We shall finde a time {Awdrie}, patience gen-tle
2342   {Awdrie}.
2343  *<S {Awd}.> Faith the Priest was good enough, for all the
2344   olde gentlemans saying.
2345  *<S {Clow}.> A most wicked Sir {Oliuer}, {Awdrie}, a most vile
2346  *{Mar- text}. But {Awdrie}, there is a youth heere in the
2347   Forrest layes claime to you.
2348  *<S {Awd}.> #I, I know who 'tis: he hath no interest in mee
2349   in the world: here comes the man you meane.
2350   <D {Enter William}.>
2351  *<S {Clo}.> It is meat and drinke to me to see a Clowne, by
      <P R6v><C B>
2352  *my troth, we that haue good wits, haue much to answer
2353   for: we shall be flouting: we cannot hold.
2354   <S {Will}.> Good eu'n {Audrey}.
2355   <S {Aud}.> God ye good eu'n {William}.
2356   <S {Will}.> And good eu'n to you Sir.
2357  *<S {Clo}.> Good eu'n gentle friend. Couer thy head, couer
2358  *thy head: Nay prethee bee couer'd. How olde are you
2359   Friend?
2360   <S {Will}.> Fiue and twentie Sir.
2361   <S {Clo}.> A ripe age: Is thy name {William}?
2362   <S {Will}.> {William}, sir.
2363   <S {Clo}.> A faire name. #Was't borne i'th Forrest heere?
2364   <S {Will}.> #I sir, I thanke God.
2365   <S {Clo}.> Thanke God: A good answer:
2366   Art rich?
2367   <S {Will}.> 'Faith sir, #so, so.
2368  *<S {Cle}.> #So, so, is good, very good, very excellent good:
2369   and yet it is not, it is but #so, so:
2370   Art thou wise?
2371   <S {Will}.> #I sir, I haue a prettie wit.
2372  *<S {Clo}.> Why, thou saist well. I do now remember a say-ing:
2373  *The Foole doth thinke he is wise, but the wiseman
2374  *knowes himselfe to be a Foole. The Heathen Philoso-pher,
2375  *when he had a desire to eate a Grape, would open
2376  *his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning there-by,
2377  *that Grapes were made to eate, and lippes to open.
2378   You do loue this maid?
2379   <S {Will}.> I do sir.
2380   <S {Clo}.> Giue me your hand: Art thou Learned?
2381   <S {Will}.> No sir.
2382  *<S {Clo}.> Then learne this of me, To #haue, is to haue. For
2383  *it is a figure in Rhetoricke, that drink being powr'd out
2384  *of a cup into a glasse, by filling the one, doth empty the
2385  *other. For all your Writers do consent, that {ipse} is hee:
2386   now you are not {ipse}, for I am #he.
2387   <S {Will}.> Which #he sir?
2388  *<S {Clo}.> He sir, that must marrie this woman: Therefore
2389  *you Clowne, abandon: which is in the vulgar, leaue the
2390  *societie: which in the boorish, is companie, of this fe-male:
2391  *which in the common, is woman: which toge-ther,
2392  *is, abandon the society of this Female, or Clowne
2393  *thou perishest: or to thy better vnderstanding, dyest; or
2394  *(to wit) I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life in-to
2395  *death, thy libertie into bondage: I will deale in poy-son
2396  *with thee, or in bastinado, or in steele: I will bandy
2397  *with thee in faction, I will ore- run thee with policie: I
2398  *will kill thee a hundred and fifty wayes, therefore trem-ble
2399   and depart.
2400   <S {Aud}.> Do good {William}.
2401   <S {Will}.> God rest you merry sir.  <D {Exit}>
2402   <D {Enter Corin}.>
2403  *<S {Cor}.> Our Master and Mistresse seekes you: come a-way,
2404   away.
2405   <S {Clo}.> Trip {Audry}, trip {Audry}, I attend,
2406   I attend.  <D {Exeunt}>
2407   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
2408   <D {Enter Orlando & Oliuer}.>
2409  *<S {Orl}.> Is't possible, that on so little acquaintance you
2410  *should like her? that, but seeing, you should loue her?
2411  *And louing woo? and wooing, she should graunt? And
2412   will you perseuer to enioy her?
2413  *<S {Ol}.> Neither call the giddinesse of it in question; the
2414  *pouertie of her, the small acquaintance, my sodaine wo-ing,
2415  *nor sodaine consenting: but say with mee, I loue
2416  *{Aliena}: say with her, that she loues mee; consent with
2417  *both, that we may enioy each other: it shall be to your
2418  *good: for my fathers house, and all the reuennew, that
2419  *was old Sir {Rowlands} will I estate vpon you, and heere
2420   liue and die a Shepherd.
2421   <D {Enter Rosalind}.>
2422   <S {Orl}.> You haue my consent.
2423   Let your Wedding be to morrow: thither will I
2424   Inuite the Duke, and all's contented followers:
2425   Go you, and prepare {Aliena}; for looke you,
2426   Heere comes my {Rosalinde}.
2427   <S {Ros}.> God saue you brother.
2428   <S {Ol}.> And you faire sister.
2429  *<S {Ros}.> Oh my deere {Orlando}, how it greeues me to see
2430   thee weare thy heart in a scarfe.
2431   <S {Orl}.> It is my arme.
2432  *<S {Ros}.> I thought thy heart had beene wounded with
2433   the clawes of a Lion.
2434   <S {Orl}.> Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a Lady.
2435  *<S {Ros}.> Did your brother tell you how I counterfeyted
2436   to sound, when he shew'd me your handkercher?
2437   <S {Orl}.> #I, and greater wonders then that.
2438  *<S {Ros}.> O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there
2439  *was neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two
2440  *Rammes, and {Cesars} Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw,
2441  *and ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no soo-ner
2442  *met, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they
2443  *lou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd
2444  *but they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew
2445  *the reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these
2446  *degrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage,
2447  *which they will climbe incontinent, or else bee inconti-nent
2448  *before marriage; they are in the verie wrath of
2449  *loue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part
2450   them.
2451  *<S {Orl}.> They shall be married to morrow: and I will
2452  *bid the Duke to the Nuptiall. But O, how bitter a thing
2453  *it is, to looke into happines through another mans eies:
2454  *by so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height
2455  *of heart heauinesse, by how much I shal thinke my bro-ther
2456   happie, in hauing what he wishes for.
2457  *<S {Ros}.> Why then to morrow, I cannot serue your turne
2458   for {Rosalind}?
2459  *<S {Orl}.> I can liue no longer by thinking.
2460  *<S {Ros}.> I will wearie you then no longer with idle tal-king.
2461  *Know of me then (for now I speake to some pur-pose)
2462  *that I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit:
2463  *I speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion
2464  *of my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: nei-ther
2465  *do I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some
2466  *little measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe
2467  *good, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please,
2468  *that I can do strange things: I haue since I was three
2469  *yeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in
2470  *his #Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue {Rosalinde}
2471  *so neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your
2472  *brother marries {Aliena}, shall you marrie her. I know in-to
2473  *what straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not
2474  *impossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you,
      <P S1>
2475  *to set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is,
2476   and without any danger.
2477   <S {Orl}.> Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
2478  *<S {Ros}.> By my life I do, which I tender deerly, though
2479  *I say I am a Magitian: Therefore put you in your best a-ray,
2480  *bid your friends: for if you will be married to mor-row,
2481   you shall: and to {Rosalind} if you will.
2482   <D {Enter Siluius & Phebe}.>
2483  *Looke, here comes a Louer of mine, and a louer of hers.
2484  *<S {Phe}.> Youth, you haue done me much vngentlenesse,
2485   To shew the letter that I writ to you.
2486   <S {Ros}.> I care not if I haue: it is my studie
2487   To seeme despightfull and vngentle to you:
2488   you are there followed by a faithful shepheard,
2489   Looke vpon him, loue him: he worships you.
2490  *<S {Phe}.> Good shepheard, tell this youth what 'tis to loue
2491   <S {Sil}.> It is to be all made of sighes and teares,
2492   And so am I for {Phebe}.
2493   <S {Phe}.> And I for {Ganimed}.
2494   <S {Orl}.> And I for {Rosalind}.
2495   <S {Ros}.> And I for no woman.
2496   <S {Sil}.> It is to be all made of faith and seruice,
2497   And so am I for {Phebe}.
2498   <S {Phe}.> And I for {Ganimed}.
2499   <S {Orl}.> And I for {Rosalind}.
2500   <S {Ros}.> And I for no woman.
2501   <S {Sil}.> It is to be all made of fantasie,
2502   All made of passion, and all made of wishes,
2503   All adoration, dutie, and obseruance,
2504   All humblenesse, all patience, and impatience,
2505   All puritie, all triall, all obseruance:
2506   And so am I for {Phebe}.
2507   <S {Phe}.> And so am I for {Ganimed}.
2508   <S {Orl}.> And so am I for {Rosalind}.
2509   <S {Ros}.> And so am I for no woman.
2510   <S {Phe}.> If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?
2511   <S {Sil}.> If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?
2512   <S {Orl}.> If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?
2513  *<S {Ros}.> Why do you speake too, Why blame you mee
2514   to loue you.
2515   <S {Orl}.> To her, that is not heere, nor doth not heare.
2516  *<S {Ros}.> Pray you no more of this, 'tis like the howling
2517  *of Irish Wolues against the Moone: I will helpe you
2518  *if I can: I would loue you if I could: To morrow meet
2519  *me altogether: I wil marrie you, if euer I marrie Wo-man,
2520  *and Ile be married to morrow: I will satisfie you,
2521  *if euer I satisfi'd man, and you shall bee married to mor-row.
2522  *I wil content you, if what pleases you contents
2523  *you, and you shal be married to morrow: As you loue
2524  *{#Rosalind} meet, as you loue {Phebe} meet, and as I loue no
2525  *woman, Ile meet: so fare you wel: I haue left you com-mands.
2526  _
2527   <S {Sil}.> Ile not faile, if I liue.

2533   will we be married.
2534  *<S {Aud}.> I do desire it with all my heart: and I hope it is
2535  *no dishonest desire, to desire to be a woman of y world?
2536   Heere come two of the banish'd Dukes Pages.

2565  *<S {Clo}.> Truly yong Gentlemen, though there was no
2566  *great matter in the dittie, yet y note was very vntunable
2567  *<S 1.{Pa}.> you are deceiu'd Sir, we kept time, we lost not
2568   our time.
2569  *<S {Clo}.> By my troth yes: I count it but time lost to heare
2570  *such a foolish song. God buy you, and God mend your
2571   voices. Come {Audrie}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2572   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2573   <D {Enter Duke Senior, Amyens, Iaques, Orlan-do},
2574   {Oliuer, Celia}.>
2575   <S {Du.Sen}.> Dost thou beleeue {Orlando}, that the boy
2576   Can do all this that he hath promised?
2577  *<S {Orl}.> I sometimes do beleeue, and somtimes do not,
2578   As those that feare they hope, and know they feare.
2579   <D {Enter Rosalinde, Siluius, & Phebe}.>
2580  *<S {Ros}.> Patience once more, whiles our co[m]pact is vrg'd:
2581   You say, if I bring in your {Rosalinde},
2582   You wil bestow her on {Orlando} heere?
2583  *<S {Du.Se}.> That would I, had I kingdoms to giue with hir.
2584  *<S {Ros}.> And you say you wil haue her, when I bring hir?
2585   <S {Orl}.> That would I, were I of all kingdomes King.
2586   <S {Ros}.> You say, you'l marrie me, if I be willing.
2587   <S {Phe}.> That will I, should I die the houre after.
2588   <S {Ros}.> But if you do refuse to marrie me,
2589   You'l giue your selfe to this most faithfull Shepheard.
2590   <S {Phe}.> So is the bargaine.
2591   <S {Ros}.> You say that you'l haue {Phebe} if she will.
2592  *<S {Sil}.> Though to haue her and death, were both one
2593   thing.
      <P S1v>
2594   <S {Ros}.> I haue promis'd to make all this matter euen:
2595  *Keepe you your word, O Duke, to giue your daughter,
2596   You yours {Orlando}, to receiue his daughter:
2597   Keepe you your word {Phebe}, that you'l marrie me,
2598   Or else refusing me to wed this shepheard:
2599   Keepe your word {Siluius}, that you'l marrie her
2600   If she refuse me, and from hence I go
2601   To make these doubts all euen.  <D {Exit Ros. and Celia}.>
2602   <S {Du.Sen}.> I do remember in this shepheard boy,
2603   Some liuely touches of my daughters fauour.
2604   <S {Orl}.> My Lord, the first time that I euer saw him,
2605   Me thought he was a brother to your daughter:
2606   But my good Lord, this Boy is Forrest borne,
2607   And hath bin tutor'd in the rudiments
2608   Of many desperate studies, by his vnckle,
2609   Whom he reports to be a great Magitian.
2610   <D {Enter Clowne and Audrey}.>
2611   Obscured in the circle of this Forrest.
2612  *<S {Iaq}.> There is sure another flood toward, and these
2613  *couples are comming to the Arke. Here comes a payre
2614  *of verie strange beasts, which in all tongues, are call'd
2615   Fooles.
2616   <S {Clo}.> Salutation and greeting to you all.
2617  *<S {Iaq}.> Good my Lord, bid him welcome: This is the
2618  *Motley- minded Gentleman, that I haue so often met in
2619   the Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares.
2620  *<S {Clo}.> If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my
2621  *purgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady,
2622  *I haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine
2623  *enemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure
2624   quarrels, and like to haue fought one.
2625   <S {Iaq}.> And how was that tane vp?
2626  *<S {Clo}.> 'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon
2627   the seuenth cause.
2628  *<S {Iaq}.> How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this
2629   fellow.
2630   <S {Du.Se}.> I like him very well.
2631  *<S {Clo}.> God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse
2632  *in heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues
2633  *to sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds
2634  *and blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il- fauor'd thing
2635  *sir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take
2636  *that that no man else will: rich honestie dwels like a mi-ser
2637  *sir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oy-ster.
2638  _
2639  *<S {Du.Se}.> By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious
2640  *<S {Clo}.> According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet
2641   diseases.
2642  *<S {Iaq}.> But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde
2643   the quarrell on the seuenth cause?
2644  *<S {Clo}.> Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your
2645  *bodie more seeming {Audry}) as thus sir: I did dislike the
2646  *cut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I
2647  *said his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it
2648  *was: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him
2649  *word againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word
2650  *he cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest.
2651  *If againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment:
2652  *this is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well
2653  *cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the
2654  *reproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold
2655  *say, I lie: this is call'd the counter- checke quarrelsome:
2656   and so to lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct.
2657  *<S {Iaq}.> And how oft did you say his beard was not well
2658   cut?
2659  *<S {Clo}.> I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial:
2660  *nor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee mea-sur'd
2661   swords, and parted.
2662  *<S {Iaq}.> Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of
2663   the lye.
2664  *<S {Clo}.> O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you
2665  *haue bookes for good manners: I will name you the de-grees.
2666  *The first, the Retort courteous: the second, the
2667  *Quip- modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth,
2668  *the Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quar-relsome:
2669  *the sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the sea-uenth,
2670  *the Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the
2671  *Lye direct: and you may auoide that too, with an #If. I
2672  *knew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell,
2673  *but when the parties were met themselues, one of them
2674  *thought but of an #If; as if you saide so, then I saide so:
2675  *and they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your #If, is
2676   the onely peace- maker: much vertue in #if.
2677  *<S {Iaq}.> Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good
2678   at any thing, and yet a foole.
2679  *<S {Du.Se}.> He vses his folly like a stalking- horse, and vn-der
2680   the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

2692   To you I giue my selfe, for I am yours.
2693  *<S {Du.Se}.> If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
2694   <S {Orl}.> If there be truth in sight, you are my {Rosalind}.
2695  *<S {Phe}.> If sight & shape be true, why then my loue adieu
2696   <S {Ros}.> Ile haue no Father, if you be not he:
2697   Ile haue no Husband, if you be not he:
2698   Nor ne're wed woman, if you be not shee.
2699   <S {Hy}.> Peace hoa: I barre confusion,
2700   'Tis I must make conclusion
2701   Of these most strange euents:
2702   Here's eight that must take hands,
2703   To ioyne in {Hymens} bands,
2704   If truth holds true contents.
2705   You and you, no crosse shall part;
2706   You and you, are hart in hart:
2707   You, to his loue must accord,
2708   Or haue a Woman to your Lord.
2709   You and you, are sure together,
2710   As the Winter to fowle Weather:
2711   Whiles a Wedlocke Hymne we sing,
2712   Feede your selues with questioning:
2713   That reason, wonder may diminish
2714   How thus we met, and these things finish.

2720   {Honor, high honor and renowne}
2721   {To Hymen, God of euerie Towne}.
2722  *<S {Du.Se}.> O my deere Neece, welcome thou art to me,
2723   Euen daughter welcome, in no lesse degree.
      <P S2>
2724   <S {Phe}.> I wil not eate my word, now thou art mine,
2725   Thy faith, my fancie to thee doth combine.
2726   <D {Enter Second Brother}.>
2727   <S 2.{Bro}.> Let me haue audience for a word or two:
2728   I am the second sonne of old {Sir Rowland},
2729   That bring these tidings to this faire assembly.
2730   {#Duke Frederick} hearing how that euerie day
2731   Men of great worth resorted to this forrest,
2732   Addrest a mightie power, which were on foote
2733   In his owne conduct, purposely to take
2734   His brother heere, and put him to the sword:
2735   And to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came;
2736   Where, meeting with an old Religious man,
2737   After some question with him, was conuerted
2738   Both from his enterprize, and from the world:
2739   His crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother,
2740   And all their Lands restor'd to him againe
2741   That were with him exil'd. This to be true,
2742   I do engage my life.
2743   <S {Du.Se}.> Welcome yong man:
2744   Thou offer'st fairely to thy brothers wedding:
2745   To one his lands with- held, and to the other
2746   A land it selfe at large, a potent Dukedome.
2747   First, in this Forrest, let vs do those ends
2748   That heere were well begun, and wel begot:
2749   And after, euery of this happie number
2750   That haue endur'd shrew'd daies, and nights with vs,
2751   Shal share the good of our returned fortune,
2752   According to the measure of their states.
2753   Meane time, forget this new- falne dignitie,
2754   And fall into our Rusticke Reuelrie:
2755   Play Musicke, and you Brides and Bride- groomes all,
2756   With measure heap'd in ioy, to'th Measures fall.
2757   <S {Iaq}.> Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,
2758   The Duke hath put on a Religious life,
2759   And throwne into neglect the pompous Court.
2760   <S 2.{Bro}.> He hath.
2761   <S {Iaq}.> To him will I: out of these conuertites,
2762   There is much matter to be heard, and learn'd:
2763   you to your former Honor, I bequeath
2764   your patience, and your vertue, well deserues it.
2765   you to a loue, that your true faith doth merit:
2766   you to your land, and loue, and great allies:
2767   you to a long, and well- deserued bed:
2768   And you to wrangling, for thy louing voyage
2769  *Is but for two moneths victuall'd: So to your pleasures,
2770   I am for other, then for dancing meazures.
2771   <S {Du.Se}.> Stay, {Iaques}, stay.
2772   <S {Iaq}.> To see no pastime, I: what you would haue,
2773   Ile stay to know, at your abandon'd caue.  <D {Exit}.>
2774  *<S {Du.Se}.> Proceed, proceed: wee'l begin these rights,
2775   As we do trust, they'l end in true delights.  <D {Exit}>
2776  *<S {Ros}.> It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epi-logue:
2777  *but it is no more vnhandsome, then to see the
2778  *Lord the Prologue. If it be true, that good wine needs
2779  *no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue.
2780  *Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good
2781  *playes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues:
2782  *What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epi-logue,
2783  *nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a
2784  *good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore
2785  *to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure
2786  *you, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O
2787  *women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much
2788  *of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men)
2789  *for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your
2790  *simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you,
2791  *and the women, the play may please. If I were a Wo-man,
2792  *I would kisse as many of you as had beards that
2793  *pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that
2794  *I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good
2795  *beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind
2796   offer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
2797   <Z FINIS.
2798   As you Like it.>
