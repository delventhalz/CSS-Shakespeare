2      <D {Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels}.>
3      <S {Barnardo}.>
4      Who's there?
5     *<S {Fran}.> Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
6      your selfe.
7      <S {Bar}.> Long liue the King.
8      <S {Fran}.> {Barnardo}?
9      <S {Bar}.> He.
10     <S {Fran}.> You come most carefully vpon your houre.
11    *<S {Bar}.> 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed {Francisco}.
12    *<S {Fran}.> For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
13     And I am sicke at heart.
14     <S {Barn}.> Haue you had quiet Guard?
15     <S {Fran}.> Not a Mouse stirring.
16    *<S {Barn}.> Well, goodnight. If you do meet {Horatio} and
17    *{Marcellus}, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make #hast.
18     <D {Enter Horatio and Marcellus}.>
19     <S {Fran}.> I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?
20     <S {Hor}.> Friends to this ground.
21     <S {Mar}.> And Leige- men to the Dane.
22     <S {Fran}.> Giue you good night.
23    *<S {Mar}.> O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?
24     <S {Fra}.> {Barnardo} ha's my place: giue you goodnight.
25     <D {Exit Fran}.>
26     <S {Mar}.> Holla {Barnardo}.
27     <S {Bar}.> Say, what is {Horatio} there?
28     <S {Hor}.> A peece of him.
29     <S {Bar}.> Welcome {Horatio}, welcome good {Marcellus}.
30    *<S {Mar}.> What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night.
31     <S {Bar}.> I haue seene nothing.
32     <S {Mar}.> {Horatio} saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
33     And will not let beleefe take hold of him
34     Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
35     Therefore I haue intreated him along
36     With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
37     That if againe this Apparition come,
38     He may approue our eyes, and speake to it.
39     <S {Hor}.> Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare.
40     <S {Bar}.> Sit downe a- while,
41     And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
42     That are so fortified against our Story,
43     What we two Nights haue seene.
44     <S {Hor}.> Well, sit we downe,
45     And let vs heare {Barnardo} speake of this.
46     <S {Barn}.> Last night of all,
47    *When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
48     Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
49     Where now it burnes, {Marcellus} and my selfe,
50     The Bell then beating one.
51     <S {Mar}.> Peace, breake thee #of:  <D {Enter the Ghost}.>
52     Looke where it comes againe.
53     <S {Barn}.> In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
54     <S {Mar}.> Thou art a Scholler; speake to it {Horatio}.
55     <S {Barn}.> Lookes it not like the King? Marke it {Horatio}.
56    *<S {Hora}.> Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
57     <S {Barn}.> It would be spoke #too.
58     <S {Mar}.> Question it {Horatio}.
59     <S {Hor}.> What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
60     Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
61     In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
62    *Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake.
63     <S {Mar}.> It is offended.
64     <S {Barn}.> See, it stalkes away.
65     <S {Hor}.> Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
66     <D {Exit the Ghost}.>
67     <S {Mar}.> 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
68    *<S {Barn}.> How now {Horatio}? You tremble & look pale:
69     Is not this something more then Fantasie?
70     What thinke you on't?
71     <S {Hor}.> Before my God, I might not this beleeue
72     Without the sensible and true auouch
73     Of mine owne eyes.
74     <S {Mar}.> Is it not like the King?
75     <S {Hor}.> As thou art to thy selfe,
76     Such was the very Armour he had on,
77     When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
78     So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
79     He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
80     'Tis strange.
81     <S {Mar}.> Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
82     With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch.
83    *<S {Hor}.> In what particular thought to work, I know not:
84     But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
85     This boades some strange erruption to our State.
86    *<S {Mar}.> Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
87     Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
88     So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
89     And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
90     And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
91     Why such impresse of Ship- wrights, whose sore Taske
92     Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
93     What might be toward, that this sweaty #hast
94     Doth make the Night ioynt- Labourer with the day:
95     Who is't that can informe me?
96     <S {Hor}.> That can I,
      <P nn5>
97     At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
98     Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
99     Was (as you know) by {Fortinbras}  of Norway,
100    (Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
101    Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant {Hamlet},
102    (For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
103    Did slay this {Fortinbras}: who by a Seal'd Compact,
104    Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
105    Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
106    Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
107    Against the which, a Moity competent
108    Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
109    To the Inheritance of {Fortinbras},
110    Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
111    And carriage of the Article designe,
112    His fell to {Hamlet}. Now sir, young {Fortinbras},
113    Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
114    Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
115    Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
116    For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
117    That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
118    (And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
119    But to recouer of vs by strong hand
120    And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
121    So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
122    Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
123    The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
124    Of this post- hast, and Romage in the Land.
125    <D {Enter Ghost againe}.>
126    But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
127    Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
128    If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
129    Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
130   *That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
131    If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
132    (Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
133    Or, if thou hast vp- hoorded in thy life
134    Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
135    (For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
136    Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it {Marcellus}.
137    <S {Mar}.> Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
138    <S {Hor}.> Do, if it will not stand.
139    <S {Barn}.> 'Tis heere.
140    <S {Hor}.> 'Tis heere.
141    <S {Mar}.> 'Tis gone.  <D {Exit Ghost}.>
142    We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
143    To offer it the shew of Violence,
144    For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
145    And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery.
146   *<S {Barn}.> It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew.
147    <S {Hor}.> And then it started, like a guilty thing
148    Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
149    The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
150    Doth with his lofty and shrill- sounding Throate
151    Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
152    Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
153    Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
154    To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
155    This present Obiect made probation.
156    <S {Mar}.> It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
157    Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
158    Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
159    The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
160    And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
161    The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
162    No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
163    So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time.
164    <S {Hor}.> So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
165    But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
166    Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
167    Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
168    Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
169    Vnto yong {Hamlet}. For vpon my life,
170    This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
171    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
172    As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
173    <S {Mar}.> Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
174    Where we shall finde him most conueniently.  <D {Exeunt}>
175    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
176    <D {Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene},
177    {Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, and his Sister O-phelia},
178    {Lords Attendant}.>
179   *<S {King}.> Though yet of {Hamlet} our deere Brothers death
180    The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
181   *To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
182    To be contracted in one brow of woe:
183    Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
184    That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
185    Together with remembrance of our selues.
186    Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
187    Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
188    Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
189    With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
190    With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
191    In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
192    Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
193    Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
194    With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
195    Now followes, that you know young {Fortinbras},
196    Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
197    Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
198    Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
199    Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
200    He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
201    Importing the surrender of those Lands
202    Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
203    To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
204    <D {Enter Voltemand and Cornelius}.>
205    Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
206    Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
207    To Norway, Vncle of young {Fortinbras},
208    Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
209    Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
210    His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
211    The Lists, and full proportions are all made
212    Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
213    You good {Cornelius}, and you {Voltemand},
214    For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
215    Giuing to you no further personall power
216    To businesse with the King, more then the scope
217    Of these dilated Articles allow:
218    Farewell, and let your #hast commend your duty.
219    <S {Volt}.> In that, and all things, will we shew our duty.
220    <S {King}.> We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.
221    <D {Exit Voltemand and Cornelius}.>
222    And now {Laertes}, what's the newes with you?
      <P nn5v>
223    You told vs of some suite. What is't {Laertes}?
224    You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
225   *And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg {Laertes},
226    That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
227    The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
228    The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,
229    Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
230    What would'st thou haue {Laertes}?
231    <S {Laer}.> Dread my Lord,
232    Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
233    From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
234    To shew my duty in your Coronation,
235    Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
236   *My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
237    And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon.
238    <S {King}.> Haue you your Fathers leaue?
239    What sayes {Pollonius}?
240    <S {Pol}.> He hath my Lord:
241    I do beseech you giue him leaue to go.
242    <S {King}.> Take thy faire houre {Laertes}, time be thine,
243    And thy best graces spend it at thy #will:
244    But now my Cosin {Hamlet}, and my Sonne?
245    <S {Ham}.> A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde.
246    <S {King}.> How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
247    <S {Ham}.> Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun.
248    <S {Queen}.> Good {Hamlet} cast thy nightly colour off,
249    And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
250    Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
251    Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
252    Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
253    Passing through Nature, to Eternity.
254    <S {Ham}.> #I Madam, it is common.
255    <S {Queen}.> If it be;
256    Why seemes it so particular with thee.
257   *<S {Ham}.> Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
258    'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
259    Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
260    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
261    No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
262    Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
263    Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
264    That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
265    For they are actions that a man might play:
266    But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
267    These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe.
268    <S {King}.> 'Tis sweet and commendable
269    In your Nature {Hamlet},
270    To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
271    But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
272    That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
273    In filiall Obligation, for some terme
274    To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
275    In obstinate Condolement, is a course
276    Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
277    It shewes a #will most incorrect to Heauen,
278    A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
279    An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
280    For, what we know must be, and is as common
281    As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
282    Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
283    Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
284    A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
285    To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
286    Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
287    From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
288    This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
289    This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
290    As of a Father; For let the world take note,
291    You are the most immediate to our Throne,
292    And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
293    Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
294    Do I impart towards you. For your intent
295    In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
296    It is most retrograde to our desire:
297    And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
298    Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
299    Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne.
300    <S {Qu}.> Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers {Hamlet}:
301    I prythee  stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg.
302    <S {Ham}.> I shall in all my best
303    Obey you Madam.
304    <S {King}.> Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
305    Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
306    This gentle and vnforc'd accord of {Hamlet}
307    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
308    No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
309    But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
310    And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
311    Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.  <D {Exeunt}>
312    <D {Manet Hamlet}.>
313    <S {Ham}.> Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
314    Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
315    Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
316    His Cannon 'gainst Selfe- slaughter. O God, O God!
317    How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
318    Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
319    Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
320   *That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
321    Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
322    But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
323    So excellent a King, that was to this
324    {Hiperion} to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
325    That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
326    Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
327    Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
328    As if encrease of Appetite had growne
329    By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
330    Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
331    A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
332    With which she followed my poore Fathers body
333    Like {Niobe}, all teares. Why she, euen she.
334    (O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
335   *Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
336    My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
337    Then I to {Hercules}. Within a Moneth?
338    Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
339    Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
340    She married. O most wicked speed, to post
341    With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
342    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
343    But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
344    <D {Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus}.>
345    <S {Hor}.> Haile to your Lordship.
346    <S {Ham}.> I am glad to see you well:
347    {Horatio}, or I do forget my selfe.
348    <S {Hor}.> The same my Lord,
349    And your poore Seruant euer.
350    <S {Ham}.> Sir my good friend,
351    Ile change that name with you:
352    And what make you from Wittenberg {Horatio}?
      <P nn6><C I>
353    {Marcellus}.
354    <S {Mar}.> My good Lord.
355    <S {Ham}.> I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
356    But what in faith make you from {Wittemberge}?
357    <S {Hor}.> A truant disposition, good my Lord.
358    <S {Ham}.> I would not haue your Enemy say so;
359    Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
360    To make it truster of your owne report
361    Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
362    But what is your affaire in {Elsenour}?
363    Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart.
364    <S {Hor}.> My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall.
365   *<S {Ham}.> I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)
366    I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding.
367    <S {Hor}.> Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon.
368   *<S {Ham}.> Thrift thrift {Horatio}: the Funerall Bakt- meats
369    Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
370    Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
371    Ere I had euer seene that day {Horatio}.
372    My father, me thinkes I see my father.
373    <S {Hor}.> Oh where my Lord?
374    <S {Ham}.> In my minds eye ({Horatio})
375    <S {Hor}.> I saw him once; he was a goodly King.
376    <S {Ham}.> He was a man, take him for all in all:
377    I shall not look vpon his like againe.
378    <S {Hor}.> My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight.
379    <S {Ham}.> Saw? Who?
380    <S {Hor}.> My Lord, the King your Father.
381    <S {Ham}.> The King my Father?
382    <S {Hor}.> Season your admiration for #a while
383    With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
384    Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
385    This maruell to you.
386    <S {Ham}.> For Heauens loue let me heare.
387    <S {Hor}.> Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
388    ({Marcellus} and {Barnardo}) on their Watch
389    In the dead #wast and middle of the night
390    Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
391    Arm'd at all points exactly, {Cap #a Pe},
392    Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
393    Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
394    By their opprest and feare- surprized eyes,
395    Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
396    Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
397    Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
398    In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
399    And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
400    Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
401    Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
402    The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
403    These hands are not more like.
404    <S {Ham}.> But where was this?
405   *<S {Mar}.> My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht.
406    <S {Ham}.> Did you not speake to it?
407    <S {Hor}.> My Lord, I did;
408    But answere made it none: yet once me thought
409    It lifted vp #it head, and did addresse
410    It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
411    But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
412    And at the sound it shrunke in #hast away,
413    And vanisht from our sight.
414    <S {Ham}.> Tis very strange.
415    <S {Hor}.> As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
416    And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
417    To let you know of it.
418    <S {Ham}.> Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
419    Hold you the watch to Night?
420    <S {Both}.> We doe my Lord.
421    <S {Ham}.> Arm'd, say you?
422    <S {Both}.> Arm'd, my Lord.
423    <S {Ham}.> From top to toe?
424    <S {Both}.> My Lord, from head to foote.
425    <S {Ham}.> Then saw you not his face?
426    <S {Hor}.> O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp.
427    <S {Ham}.> What, lookt he frowningly?
428    <S {Hor}.> A countenance more in sorrow then in anger.
429    <S {Ham}.> Pale, or red?
430    <S {Hor}.> Nay very pale.
431    <S {Ham}.> And fixt his eyes vpon you?
432    <S {Hor}.> Most constantly.
433    <S {Ham}.> I would I had beene there.
434    <S {Hor}.> It would haue much amaz'd you.
435    <S {Ham}.> Very like, very like: staid it long?
436   *<S {Hor}.> While one with moderate #hast might tell a hun-|(dred.
437    <S {All}.> Longer, longer.
438    <S {Hor}.> Not when I saw't.
439    <S {Ham}.> His Beard was grisly? no.
440    <S {Hor}.> It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
441    A Sable Siluer'd.
442   *<S {Ham}.> Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake a-|(gaine.
443    <S {Hor}.> I warrant you it will.
444    <S {Ham}.> If it assume my noble Fathers person,
445    Ile speake to it, though #Hell it selfe should gape
446    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
447    If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
448    Let it bee treble in your silence still:
449    And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
450    Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
451    I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:
452    Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
453    Ile visit you.
454    <S {All}.> Our duty to your Honour.  <D {Exeunt}.>
455    <S {Ham}.> Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
456    My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
457   *I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
458    Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
459   *Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.  <D {Exit}.>
460    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
461    <D {Enter Laertes and Ophelia}.>
462    <S {Laer}.> My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
463    And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
464    And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
465    But let me heare from you.
466    <S {Ophel}.> Doe you doubt that?
467    <S {Laer}.> For {Hamlet}, and the trifling of his fauours,
468    Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;
469    A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
470    Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
471    The suppliance of a minute? No more.
472    <S {Ophel}.> No more but so.
473    <S {Laer}.> Thinke it no more:
474    For nature cressant does not grow alone,
475    In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
476    The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
477    Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
478    And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
479    The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
      <P nn6v>
480    His greatnesse weigh'd, his #will is not his owne;
481    For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
482    Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
483    Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
484    The sanctity and health of the whole State.
485    And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
486    Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
487   *Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
488    It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
489    As he in his peculiar Sect and force
490    May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
491    Then the maine voyce of {Denmarke} goes withall.
492    Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,
493    If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
494    Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
495    To his vnmastred importunity.
496    Feare it {Ophelia}, feare it my deare Sister,
497    And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
498    Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
499    The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
500    If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
501    Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
502    The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
503    Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
504    And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
505    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
506    Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
507    Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere.
508    <S {Ophe}.> I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,
509    As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother
510    Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
511    Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
512    Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
513    Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
514    And reaks not his owne reade.
515    <S {Laer}.> Oh, feare me not.
516    <D {Enter Polonius}.>
517    I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
518    A double blessing is a double grace;
519    Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue.
520   *<S {Polon}.> Yet heere {Laertes}? Aboord, aboord for shame,
521    The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
522    And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
523    And these few Precepts in thy memory,
524    See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
525    Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:
526    Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:
527    The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,
528    Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
529    But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
530    Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
531    Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
532    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
533    Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
534    Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
535    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
536    But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
537    For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
538    And they in France of the best ranck and station,
539    Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
540    Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
541    For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
542    And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
543    This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
544    And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
545    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
546    Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee.
547    <S {Laer}.> Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord.
548   *<S {Polon}.> The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend.
549    <S {Laer}.> Farewell {Ophelia}, and remember well
550    What I haue said to you.
551    <S {Ophe}.> Tis in my memory lockt,
552    And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it.
553    <S {Laer}.> Farewell.  <D {Exit Laer}.>
554    <S {Polon}.> What ist {Ophelia} he hath said to you?
555   *<S {Ophe}.> So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. {Hamlet}.
556    <S {Polon}.> Marry, well bethought:
557    Tis told me he hath very oft of late
558    Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
559    Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
560    If it be so, as so tis put on me;
561    And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
562    You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
563    As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
564    What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
565    <S {Ophe}.> He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
566    Of his affection to me.
567   *<S {Polon}.> Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
568    Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
569    Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
570   *<S {Ophe}.> I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke.
571   *<S {Polon}.> Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
572    That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
573   *Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
574    Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
575    Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole.
576    <S {Ophe}.> My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
577    In honourable fashion.
578    <S {Polon}.> #I, fashion you may call it, go #too, go #too.
579    <S {Ophe}.> And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
580    My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen.
581   *<S {Polon}.> #I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
582    When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
583    Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
584    Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
585    Euen in their promise, as it is #a making;
586    You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
587    Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
588    Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
589    Then a command to parley. For Lord {Hamlet},
590    Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
591    And with a larger tether may he walke,
592    Then may be giuen you. In few, {Ophelia},
593    Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
594    Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
595    But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
596    Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
597    The better to beguile. This is for all:
598    I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
599    Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
600    As to giue words or talke with the Lord {Hamlet}:
601    Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes.
602    <S {Ophe}.> I shall obey my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
603    <D {Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus}.>
604    <S {Ham}.> The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
605    <S {Hor}.> It is a nipping and an eager ayre.
606    <S {Ham}.> What hower now?
607    <S {Hor}.> I thinke it lacks of twelue.
608    <S {Mar}.> No, it is strooke.
609   *<S {Hor}.> Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the |(season,
610    Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
      <P oo1>
611    What does this meane my Lord?
612    <S {Ham}.> The King doth wake to night, and takes his |(rouse,
613    Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
614    And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
615    The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
616    The triumph of his Pledge.
617    <S {Horat}.> Is it a custome?
618    <S {Ham}.> #I marry ist;
619    And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
620    And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
621    More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
622    <D {Enter Ghost}.>
623    <S {Hor}.> Looke my Lord, it comes.
624    <S {Ham}.> Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
625    Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
626    Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from #Hell,
627    Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
628    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
629    That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee {Hamlet},
630    King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
631    Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
632    Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
633    Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
634    Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
635    Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
636    To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
637    That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
638    Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
639    Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
640    So horridly to shake our disposition,
641    With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
642    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?
643    <D {#Ghost beckens Hamlet}.>
644    <S {Hor}.> It beckons you to goe away with it,
645    As if it some impartment did desire
646    To you alone.
647    <S {Mar}.> Looke with what courteous action
648    It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
649    But doe not goe with it.
650    <S {Hor}.> No, by no meanes.
651    <S {Ham}.> It will not speake: then will I follow it.
652    <S {Hor}.> Doe not my Lord.
653    <S {Ham}.> Why, what should be the feare?
654    I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
655    And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
656    Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
657    It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it.
658   *<S {Hor}.> What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
659    Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
660    That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
661    And there assumes some other horrible forme,
662    Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
663    And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
664    <S {Ham}.> It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee.
665    <S {Mar}.> You shall not goe my Lord.
666    <S {Ham}.> Hold off your hand.
667    <S {Hor}.> Be rul'd, you shall not goe.
668    <S {Ham}.> My fate cries out,
669    And makes each petty Artire in this body,
670    As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
671    Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
672    By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
673    I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
674    <D {Exeunt Ghost & Hamlet}.>
675    <S {Hor}.> He waxes desperate with imagination.
676    <S {Mar}.> Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
677    <S {Hor}.> Haue after, to what issue will this come?
678   *<S {Mar}.> Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke.
679    <S {Hor}.> Heauen will direct it.
680    <S {Mar}.> Nay, let's follow him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
681    <D {Enter Ghost and Hamlet}.>
682   *<S {Ham}.> Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no fur-|(ther.
683    <S {Gho}.> Marke me.
684    <S {Ham}.> I will.
685    <S {Gho}.> My hower is almost come,
686    When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
687    Must render vp my selfe.
688    <S {Ham}.> Alas poore Ghost.
689    <S {Gho}.> Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
690    To what I shall vnfold.
691    <S {Ham}.> Speake, I am bound to heare.
692    <S {Gho}.> So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare.
693    <S {Ham}.> What?
694    <S {Gho}.> I am thy Fathers Spirit,
695    Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
696    And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
697    Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
698    Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
699    To tell the secrets of my Prison- House;
700    I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
701    Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
702   *Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
703    Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
704    And each particular haire to stand #an end,
705    Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
706    But this eternall blason must not be
707    To eares of flesh and bloud; list {Hamlet}, oh list,
708    If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue.
      <C B>
709    <S {Ham}.> Oh Heauen!
710   *<S {Gho}.> Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther.
711    <S {Ham}.> Murther?
712    <S {Ghost}.> Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
713    But #this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall.
714    <S {Ham}.> #Hast, #hast me to know it,
715    That with wings as swift
716    As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
717    May sweepe to my Reuenge.
718    <S {Ghost}.> I finde thee apt,
719    And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
720    That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
721    Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now {Hamlet} heare:
722    It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
723    A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
724    Is by a forged processe of my death
725    Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
726    The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
727    Now weares his Crowne.
728    <S {Ham}.> O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
729    <S {Ghost}.> #I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
730    With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
731    Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
732    So to seduce? Won  to this shamefull Lust
733    The #will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
734    Oh {Hamlet}, what a falling off was there,
735    From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
736    That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
737    I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
738    Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
739   *To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
740    Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
741    So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
742   *Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
      <P oo1v><C I>
743    But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
744    Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
745    My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
746    Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
747    With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
748    And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
749    The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
750    Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
751    That swift as Quick- siluer, it courses through
752    The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;
753    And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
754    And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
755    The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
756    And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
757    Most Lazar- like, with vile and loathsome crust,
758    All my smooth Body.
759    Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
760    Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
761    Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
762    Vnhouzzled,  disappointed, vnnaneld,
763    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
764    With all my imperfections on my head;
765    Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
766    If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
767    Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
768    A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
769    But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
770    Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
771    Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
772    And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
773    To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
774    The Glow- worme showes the Matine to be neere,
775    And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
776    Adue, adue, {Hamlet}: remember me.  <D {Exit}.>
777   *<S {Ham}.> Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
778    And shall I couple #Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
779    And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
780    But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
781    #I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
782    In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
783    Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
784    Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
785    All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
786    That youth and obseruation coppied there;
787    And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
788    Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
789    Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:
790    Oh most pernicious woman!
791    Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
792    My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
793    That one may smile, and  smile and be a Villaine;
794    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
795    So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
796    It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't.
797    <S {Hor}. {&} {Mar}. {within}.> My Lord, my Lord.
798    <D {Enter Horatio and Marcellus}.>
799    <S {Mar}.> Lord {Hamlet}.
800    <S {Hor}.> Heauen secure him.
801    <S {Mar}.> So be it.
802    <S {Hor}.> Illo, ho, ho, my Lord.
803    <S {Ham}.> Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come.
804    <S {Mar}.> How ist my Noble Lord?
805    <S {Hor}.> What newes, my Lord?
806    <S {Ham}.> Oh wonderfull!
807    <S {Hor}.> Good my Lord tell it.
808    <S {Ham}.> No you'l reueale it.
809    <S {Hor}.> Not I, my Lord, by Heauen.
810    <S {Mar}.> Nor I, my Lord.
811    <S {Ham}.> How say you then, would heart of man once |(think it?
812    But you'l be secret?
813    <S {Both}.> #I, by Heau'n, my Lord.
814   *<S {Ham}.> There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
815    But hee's an arrant knaue.
816   *<S {Hor}.> There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
817    Graue, to tell vs this.
818    <S {Ham}.> Why right, you are i'th' right;
819    And so, without more circumstance at all,
820    I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
821    You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
822    For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
823    Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
824    Looke you, Ile goe pray.
825   *<S {Hor}.> These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord.
826    <S {Ham}.> I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
827    Yes faith, heartily.
828    <S {Hor}.> There's no offence my Lord.
829    <S {Ham}.> Yes, by Saint {Patricke}, but there is my Lord,
830    And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
831    It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
832    For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
833    O'remaster't  as you may. And now good friends,
834    As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
835    Giue me one poore request.
836    <S {Hor}.> What is't my Lord? we will.
837   *<S {Ham}.> Neuer make known what you haue seen to night.
838    <S {Both}.> My Lord, we will not.
839    <S {Ham}.> Nay, but swear't.
840    <S {Hor}.> Infaith my Lord, not I.
841    <S {Mar}.> Nor I my Lord: in faith.
842    <S {Ham}.> Vpon my sword.
843    <S {Marcell}.> We haue sworne my Lord already.
844    <S {Ham}.> Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed.
845    <S {Gho}.> Sweare. <D {Ghost cries vnder the Stage}.>
846   *<S {Ham}.> Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there true-penny?
847   *Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
848    Consent to sweare.
849    <S {Hor}.> Propose the Oath my Lord.
850    <S {Ham}.> Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
851    Sweare by my sword.
852    <S {Gho}.> Sweare.
853    <S {Ham}.> {Hic & vbique}? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
854    Come hither Gentlemen,
855    And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
856    Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:
857    Sweare by my Sword.
858    <S {Gho}.> Sweare.
859   *<S {Ham}.> Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so |(fast?
860    A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends.
861   *<S {Hor}.> Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange.
862    <S {Ham}.> And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
863    There are more things in Heauen and Earth, {Horatio},
864    Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,
865    Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
866    How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
867    (As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
868    To put an Anticke disposition on:)
869    That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
870    With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
871    Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
872    As well, we know, or we #could #and if we would,
873    Or if we list to speake; or there be #and if there might,
874    Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
      <P oo2>
875    That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
876   *So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:
877    Sweare.
878    <S {Ghost}.> Sweare.
879    <S {Ham}.> Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
880    With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
881    And what so poore a man as {Hamlet} is,
882    May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
883    God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
884    And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
885    The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
886    That euer I was borne to set it right.
887    Nay, come let's goe together.  <D {Exeunt}.>
888    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
889    <D {Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo}.>
890    <S {Polon}.> Giue him his money, and these notes {Reynoldo}.
891    <S {Reynol}.> I will my Lord.
892    <S {Polon}.> You shall doe maruels wisely: good {Reynoldo},
893    Before you visite him you make inquiry
894    Of his behauiour.
895    <S {Reynol}.> My Lord, I did intend it.
896    <S {Polon}.> Marry, well said;
897    Very well said. Looke you Sir,
898    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
899   *And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
900    What company, at what expence: and finding
901    By this encompassement and drift of question,
902   *That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
903    Then your particular demands will touch it,
904    Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
905    And thus I know his father and his friends,
906    And in part him. Doe you marke this {Reynoldo}?
907    <S {Reynol}.> #I, very well my Lord.
908    <S {Polon}.> And in part him, but you may say not well;
909    But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
910    Addicted so and so; and there put on him
911    What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,
912    As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
913    But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
914    As are Companions noted and most knowne
915    To youth and liberty.
916    <S {Reynol}.> As gaming my Lord.
917    <S {Polon}.> #I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
918    Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre.
919    <S {Reynol}.> My Lord that would dishonour him.
920    <S {Polon}.> Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
921    You must not put another scandall on him,
922    That hee is open to Incontinencie;
923   *That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
924    That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
925    The flash and out- breake of a fiery minde,
926    A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault.
927    <S {Reynol}.> But my good Lord.
928    <S {Polon}.> Wherefore should you doe this?
929    <S {Reynol}.> #I my Lord, I would know that.
930    <S {Polon}.> Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
931    And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
932    You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
933    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
934    Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would |(sound,
935    Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
936    The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
937    He closes with you in this consequence:
938    Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
939    According to the Phrase and the Addition,
940    Of man and Country.
941    <S {Reynol}.> Very good my Lord.
942    <S {Polon}.> And then Sir does he this?
943    He does: what was I about to say?
944    I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
945    <S {Reynol}.> At closes in the consequence:
946    At friend, or so, and Gentleman.
947    <S {Polon}.> At closes in the consequence, #I marry,
948    He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
949    I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
950    Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
951    There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
952    There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
953    I saw him enter such a house of saile;
954    {Videlicet}, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;
955    Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
956    And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
957    With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
958    By indirections finde directions out:
959    So by my former Lecture and aduice
960    Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
961    <S {Reynol}.> My Lord I haue.
962    <S {Polon}.> God buy you; fare you well.
963    <S {Reynol}.> Good my Lord.
964    <S {Polon}.> Obserue his inclination in your selfe.
965    <S {Reynol}.> I shall my Lord.
966    <S {Polon}.> And let him plye his Musicke.
967    <S {Reynol}.> Well, my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
968    <D {Enter Ophelia}.>
969    <S {Polon}.> Farewell:
970    How now {Ophelia}, what's the matter?
971    <S {Ophe}.> Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted.
972    <S {Polon}.> With what, in the name of Heauen?
973    <S {Ophe}.> My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
974    Lord {Hamlet} with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
975    No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
976    Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
977    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
978    And with a looke so pitious in purport,
979    As if he had been loosed out of #hell,
980    To speake of horrors: he comes before me.
981    <S {Polon}.> Mad for thy Loue?
982   *<S {Ophe}.> My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it.
983    <S {Polon}.> What said he?
984    <S {Ophe}.> He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
985    Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
986    And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
987    He fals to such perusall of my face,
988    As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
989    At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
990    And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
991    He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
992    That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
993    And end his #being. That done, he lets me goe,
994    And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
995    He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
996    For out #a#dores he went without their helpe;
997    And to the last, bended their light on me.
998    <S {Polon}.> Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
999    This is the very extasie of Loue,
1000   Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
      <P oo2v><C B>
1001   And leads the #will to desperate Vndertakings,
1002   As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
1003   That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
1004   What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
1005  *<S {Ophe}.> No my good Lord: but as you did command,
1006   I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
1007   His accesse to me.
1008   <S {Pol}.> That hath made him mad.
1009   I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
1010   I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
1011   And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
1012   It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
1013   To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
1014   As it is common for the yonger sort
1015   To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
1016   This must be knowne, being kept close might moue
1017   More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1018   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1019   <D {Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guilden-sterne}
1020   {Cum alijs}.>
1021  *<S {King}.> Welcome deere {Rosincrance} and {Guildensterne}.
1022   Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
1023   The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
1024   Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard
1025   Of {Hamlets} transformation: so I call it,
1026   Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
1027   Resembles that it was. What it should bee
1028   More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
1029   So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
1030   I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
1031   That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
1032   And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
1033   That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
1034   Some little time: so by your Companies
1035   To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
1036   So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
1037   That open'd lies within our remedie.
1038  *<S {Qu}.> Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1039   And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
1040   To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1041   To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good #will,
1042   As to expend your time with vs a- while,
1043   For the supply and profit of our Hope,
1044   Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
1045   As fits a Kings remembrance.
1046   <S {Rosin}.> Both your Maiesties
1047   Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
1048   Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
1049   Then to Entreatie.
1050   <S {Guil}.> We both obey,
1051   And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
1052   To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
1053   To be commanded.
1054  *<S {King}.> Thankes {Rosincrance}, and gentle {Guildensterne}.
1055   <S {Qu}.> Thankes {Guildensterne} and gentle {Rosincrance}.
1056   And I beseech you instantly to visit
1057   My too much changed Sonne.
1058   Go some of ye,
1059   And bring the Gentlemen where {Hamlet} is.
1060  *<S {Guil}.> Heauens make our presence and our practises
1061   Pleasant and helpfull to him.  <D {Exit}.>
1062   <S {Queene}.> Amen.
1063   <D {Enter Polonius}.>
1064  *<S {Pol}.> Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
1065   Are ioyfully return'd.
1066   <S {King}.> Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes.
1067   <S {Pol}.> Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,
1068   I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
1069   Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
1070   And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
1071   Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
1072   As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
1073   The very cause of {Hamlets} Lunacie.
1074   <S {King}.> Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare.
1075   <S {Pol}.> Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
1076   My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast.
1077  *<S {King}.> Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
1078   He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
1079   The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper.
1080   <S {Qu}.> I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
1081   His Fathers death, and our o're- hasty Marriage.
1082   <D {Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius}.>
1083  *<S {King}.> Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:
1084   Say {Voltumand}, what from our Brother Norwey?
1085   <S {Volt}.> Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
1086   Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
1087   His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
1088   To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
1089   But better look'd into, he truly found
1090   It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
1091   That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
1092   Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
1093   On {Fortinbras}, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
1094   Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
1095   Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
1096   To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
1097   Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
1098   Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
1099   And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
1100   So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
1101   With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
1102   That it might please you to giue quiet passe
1103   Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
1104   On such regards of safety and allowance,
1105   As therein are set downe.
1106   <S {King}.> It likes vs well:
1107   And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
1108   Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
1109  *Meane time we thanke you, for your well- tooke Labour.
1110   Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
1111   Most welcome home.  <D {Exit Ambass}.>
1112   <S {Pol}.> This businesse is very well ended.
1113   My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
1114   What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
1115   Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
1116   Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
1117   Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
1118   And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
1119   I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
1120   Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
1121   What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
1122   But let that go.
1123   <S {Qu}.> More matter, with lesse #Art.
1124   <S {Pol}.> Madam, I sweare I vse no #Art at all:
1125   That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
1126   And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
1127   But farewell #it: for I will vse no #Art.
      <P oo3>
1128   Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
1129   That we finde out the cause of this effect,
1130   Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
1131   For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
1132   Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
1133   I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
1134   Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
1135   Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.
1136   <D {The Letter}.>
1137  *{To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed O-phelia}.
1138  _
1139  *That's an #ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
1140  *Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white
1141   bosome, these.
1142   <S {Qu}.> Came this from {Hamlet} to her.
1143   <S {Pol}.> Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
1144   {Doubt thou, the Starres are fire},
1145   {Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue}:
1146   {Doubt Truth to be a Lier},
1147   {But neuer Doubt, I loue}.
1148  *{O deere Ophelia, I am #ill at these Numbers: I haue not #Art to}
1149  *{reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best be-leeue}
1150   {it. Adieu}.
1151   {Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this}
1152   {Machine is to him}, Hamlet.
1153   This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
1154   And more aboue hath his soliciting,
1155   As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
1156   All giuen to mine eare.
1157   <S {King}.> But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
1158   <S {Pol}.> What do you thinke of me?
1159   <S {King}.> As of a man, faithfull and Honourable.
1160  *<S {Pol}.> I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?
1161   When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
1162   As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
1163   Before my Daughter told me what might you
1164   Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
1165   If I had playd the Deske or Table- booke,
1166   Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
1167   Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
1168   What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
1169   And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
1170   Lord {Hamlet} is a Prince out of thy Starre,
1171   This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
1172   That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
1173   Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
1174   Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
1175   And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
1176   Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
1177   Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
1178   Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
1179   Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
1180   And all we waile for.
1181   <S {King}.> Do you thinke 'tis this?
1182   <S {Qu}.> It may be very likely.
1183  *<S {Pol}.> Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
1184   That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
1185   When it prou'd otherwise?
1186   <S {King}.> Not that I know.
1187   <S {Pol}.> Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
1188   If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
1189   Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
1190   Within the Center.
1191   <S {King}.> How may we try it further?
1192   <S {Pol}.> You know sometimes
1193   He walkes foure houres together, heere
1194   In the Lobby.
1195   <S {Qu}.> So he ha's indeed.
1196   <S {Pol}.> At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
1197   Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
1198   Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
1199   And be not from his reason falne thereon;
1200   Let me be no Assistant for a State,
1201   And keepe a Farme and Carters.
1202   <S {King}.> We will try it.
1203   <D {Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke}.>
1204   <S {Qu}.> But looke where sadly the poore wretch
1205   Comes reading.
1206   <S {Pol}.> Away I do beseech you, both away,
1207   Ile boord him presently.  <D {Exit King & Queen}.>
1208   Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord {Hamlet}?
1209   <S {Ham}.> Well, God- a- mercy.
1210   <S {Pol}.> Do you know me, my Lord?
1211  *<S {Ham}.> Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger.
1212   <S {Pol}.> Not I my Lord.
1213   <S {Ham}.> Then I would you were so honest a man.
1214   <S {Pol}.> Honest, my Lord?
1215  *<S {Ham}.> #I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
1216   one man pick'd out of two thousand.
1217   <S {Pol}.> That's very true, my Lord.
1218  *<S {Ham}.> For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
1219   being a good kissing Carrion===
1220   Haue you a daughter?
1221   <S {Pol}.> I haue my Lord.
1222  *<S {Ham}.> Let her not walke i'th#Sunne: Conception is a
1223  *blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend
1224   looke too't.
1225  *<S {Pol}.> How say you by that? Still harping on my daugh-ter:
1226  *yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmon-ger:
1227  *he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
1228  *I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
1229   speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?
1230   <S {Ham}.> Words, words, words.
1231   <S {Pol}.> What is the matter, my Lord?
1232   <S {Ham}.> Betweene who?
1233   <S {Pol}.> I meane the matter you meane, my Lord.
1234  *<S {Ham}.> Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
1235  *that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrin-kled;
1236  *their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum- Tree
1237  *Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
1238  *together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I
1239  *most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
1240  *not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
1241  *selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
1242   go backward.
1243   <S {Pol}.> Though this be madnesse,
1244   Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
1245   Out of the ayre my Lord?
1246   <S {Ham}.> Into my Graue?
1247   <S {Pol}.> Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:
1248   How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
1249   A happinesse,
1250   That often Madnesse hits on,
1251   Which Reason and Sanitie could not
1252   So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
1253   I will leaue him,
1254   And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
1255   Betweene him, and my daughter.
1256   My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly
1257   Take my leaue of you.
      <P oo3v><C I>
1258  *<S {Ham}.> You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
1259  *will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
1260   life.
1261   <S {Polon}.> Fare you well my Lord.
1262   <S {Ham}.> These tedious old fooles.
1263  *<S {Polon}.> You goe to seeke my Lord {Hamlet}; there
1264   hee is.
1265   <D {Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne}.>
1266   <S {Rosin}.> God saue you Sir.
1267   <S {Guild}.> Mine honour'd Lord?
1268   <S {Rosin}.> My most deare Lord?
1269  *<S {Ham}.> My excellent good friends? How do'st thou
1270  *{Guildensterne}? Oh, {Rosincrane}; good Lads: How doe ye
1271   both?
1272   <S {Rosin}.> As the indifferent Children of the earth.
1273  *<S {Guild}.> Happy, in that we are not ouer- happy: on For-tunes
1274   Cap, we are not the very Button.
1275   <S {Ham}.> Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
1276   <S {Rosin}.> Neither my Lord.
1277  *<S {Ham}.> Then you liue about her waste, or in the mid-dle
1278   of her fauour?
1279   <S {Guil}.> Faith, her priuates, we.
1280  *<S {Ham}.> In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:
1281   she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?
1282  *<S {Rosin}.> None my Lord; but that the World's growne
1283   honest.
1284  *<S {Ham}.> Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is
1285  *not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue
1286  *you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
1287   that she sends you to Prison hither?
1288   <S {Guil}.> Prison, my Lord?
1289   <S {Ham}.> Denmark's a Prison.
1290   <S {Rosin}.> Then is the World one.
1291  *<S {Ham}.> A goodly one, in which there are many Con-fines,
1292  *Wards, and Dungeons; {Denmarke} being one o'th'
1293   worst.
1294   <S {Rosin}.> We thinke not so my Lord.
1295  *<S {Ham}.> Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
1296  *either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
1297   a prison.
1298  *<S {Rosin}.> Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
1299   too narrow for your minde.
1300  *<S {Ham}.> O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
1301  *count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
1302   I haue bad dreames.
1303  *<S {Guil}.> Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
1304  *very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
1305   of a Dreame.
1306   <S {Ham}.> A dreame it selfe is but a shadow.
1307  *<S {Rosin}.> Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
1308   light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow.
1309  *<S {Ham}.> Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Mo-narchs
1310  *and out- stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
1311  *shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot rea-son?
1312  _
1313   <S {Both}.> Wee'l wait vpon you.
1314  *<S {Ham}.> No such matter. I will not sort you with the
1315  *rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
1316  *man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
1317   way of friendship, What make you at {Elsonower}?
1318   <S {Rosin}.> To visit you my Lord, no other occasion.
1319  *<S {Ham}.> Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
1320  *but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
1321  *are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it
1322  *your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
1323   deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake.
1324   <S {Guil}.> What should we say my Lord?
1325  *<S {Ham}.> Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were
1326  *sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
1327  *which your modesties haue not craft enough to co-lor,
1328  *I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you.
1329   <S {Rosin}.> To what end my Lord?
1330  *<S {Ham}.> That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
1331  *you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
1332  *our youth, by the Obligation of our euer- preserued loue,
1333  *and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
1334  *you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
1335   were sent for or no.
1336   <S {Rosin}.> What say you?
1337  *<S {Ham}.> Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me
1338   hold not off.
1339   <S {Guil}.> My Lord, we were sent for.
1340  *<S {Ham}.> I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
1341  *preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
1342  *Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
1343  *I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of ex-ercise;
1344  *and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my dispositi-on;
1345  *that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a ster-rill
1346  *Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
1347  *look you, this braue ore- hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
1348  *fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
1349  *to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of va-pours.
1350  *What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in
1351  *Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing
1352  *how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an An-gel?
1353  *in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the
1354  *world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
1355  *this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,
1356  *nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
1357   to say so.
1358  *<S {Rosin}.> My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
1359   thoughts.
1360  *<S {Ham}.> Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
1361   not me?
1362  *<S {Rosin}.> To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
1363  *what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
1364  *from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
1365   they comming to offer you Seruice.
1366  *<S {Ham}.> He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
1367  *Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
1368  *Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
1369  *not sigh {gratis}, the humorous man shall end his part in
1370  *peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
1371  *are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
1372  *freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
1373   are they?
1374  *<S {Rosin}.> Euen those you were wont to take delight in
1375   the Tragedians of the City.
1376  *<S {Ham}.> How chances it they trauaile? their resi-dence
1377  *both in reputation and profit was better both
1378   wayes.
1379  *<S {Rosin}.> I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
1380   of the late Innouation?
1381  *<S {Ham}.> Doe they hold the same estimation they did
1382   when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?
1383   <S {Rosin}.> No indeed, they are not.
1384   <S {Ham}.> How comes it? doe they grow rusty?
1385  *<S {Rosin}.> Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
1386  *pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
1387  *Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
1388  *are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
      <P oo4><C B>
1389  *fashion, and so be- ratled the common Stages (so they
1390  *call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
1391   Goose- quils, and dare scarse come thither.
1392  *<S {Ham}.> What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?
1393  *How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no
1394  *longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
1395  *if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
1396  *it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Wri-ters
1397  *do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
1398   owne Succession.
1399  *<S {Rosin}.> Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
1400  *and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Con-trouersie.
1401  *There was for #a while, no mony bid for argu-ment,
1402  *vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
1403   the Question.
1404   <S {Ham}.> Is't possible?
1405  *<S {Guild}.> Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of
1406   Braines.
1407   <S {Ham}.> Do the Boyes carry it away?
1408  *<S {Rosin}.> #I that they do my Lord. {Hercules} & his load too.
1409  *<S {Ham}.> It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
1410  *Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
1411  *while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
1412  *Ducates #a peece, for his picture in Little. There is some-thing
1413  *in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
1414   finde it out.
1415   <D {Flourish for the Players}.>
1416   <S {Guil}.> There are the Players.
1417  *<S {Ham}.> Gentlemen, you are welcom to {Elsonower}: your
1418  *hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
1419  *and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
1420  *lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
1421  *fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
1422  *then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
1423   and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd.
1424   <S {Guil}.> In what my deere Lord?
1425  *<S {Ham}.> I am but mad North, North- West: when the
1426  *Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
1427   <D {Enter Polonius}.>
1428   <S {Pol}.> Well be with you Gentlemen.
1429  *<S {Ham}.> Hearke you {Guildensterne}, and you too: at each
1430  *eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
1431   out of his swathing clouts.
1432  *<S {Rosin}.> Happily he's the second time come to them: for
1433   they say, an old man is twice a childe.
1434  *<S {Ham}.> I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the
1435  *Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday mor-ning
1436   'twas so indeed.
1437   <S {Pol}.> My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
1438   <S {Ham}.> My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
1439   When {Rossius} an Actor in Rome===
1440   <S {Pol}.> The Actors are come hither my Lord.
1441   <S {Ham}.> Buzze, buzze.
1442   <S {Pol}.> Vpon mine Honor.
1443   <S {Ham}.> Then can each Actor on his Asse===
1444  *<S {Polon}.> The best Actors in the world, either for Trage-die,
1445  *Comedie, Historie, Pastorall: Pastoricall- Comicall- Historicall- Pastorall:
1446  *Tragicall- Historicall: Tragicall- Comicall- Historicall- Pastorall:
1447  *Scene indiuidible: or Po-em
1448  *vnlimited. {Seneca} cannot be too heauy, nor {Plautus}
1449  *too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are
1450   the onely men.
1451  *<S {Ham}.> O {Iephta} Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st
1452   thou?
1453   <S {Pol}.> What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
1454   <S {Ham}.> Why one faire Daughter, and no more,
1455   The which he loued passing well.
1456   <S {Pol}.> Still on my Daughter.
1457   <S {Ham}.> Am I not i'th' right old {Iephta}?
1458  *<S {Polon}.> If you call me {Iephta} my Lord, I haue a daugh-ter
1459   that I loue passing well.
1460   <S {Ham}.> Nay that followes not.
1461   <S {Polon}.> What followes then, my Lord?
1462  *<S {Ha}.> Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It
1463  *came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
1464  *{Pons Chanson} will shew you more. For looke where my
1465   Abridgements come.
1466   <D {Enter foure or fiue Players}.>
1467  *Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see
1468  *thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?
1469  *Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
1470  *beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mi-stris?
1471  *Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
1472  *I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
1473  *your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
1474  *within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
1475  *to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
1476  *haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your qua-lity:
1477   come, a passionate speech.
1478   <S 1.{Play}.> What speech, my Lord?
1479  *<S {Ham}.> I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
1480  *neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
1481  *remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas {Cauiarie} to the
1482  *Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
1483  *iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
1484  *excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
1485  *with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,
1486  *there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sa-uory;
1487  *nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
1488  *Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One
1489  *cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas {Aeneas} Tale
1490  *to {Dido}, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
1491  *of {Priams} slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at
1492  *this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged {Pyrrhus} like
1493  *th'{#Hyrcanian} Beast. It is not so: it begins with {Pyrrhus}
1494   The rugged {Pyrrhus}, he whose Sable Armes
1495   Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
1496   When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
1497   Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
1498   With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
1499   Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
1500   With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
1501   Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
1502   That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
1503   To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
1504   And thus o're- sized with coagulate gore,
1505   With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish {Pyrrhus}
1506   Olde Grandsire {Priam} seekes.
1507  *<S {Pol}.> Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good ac-cent,
1508   and good discretion.
1509   <S 1.{Player}.> Anon he findes him,
1510   Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,
1511   Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
1512   Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
1513   {Pyrrhus} at {Priam} driues, in Rage strikes wide:
1514   But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
1515   Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,
1516   Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
1517   Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
1518   Takes Prisoner {Pyrrhus} eare. For loe, his Sword
1519   Which was declining on the Milkie head
1520   Of Reuerend {Priam}, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
      <P oo4v>
1521   So as a painted Tyrant {Pyrrhus} stood,
1522  *And like a Newtrall to his #will and matter, did nothing.
1523   But as we often see against some storme,
1524   A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
1525   The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
1526   As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
1527   Doth rend the Region. So after {Pyrrhus} pause,
1528   A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a- worke,
1529   And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
1530   On Mars #his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
1531   With lesse remorse then {Pyrrhus} bleeding sword
1532   Now falles on {Priam}.
1533   Out, out, thou Strumpet- Fortune, all you Gods,
1534   In generall Synod take away her power:
1535   Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
1536   And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
1537   As low as to the Fiends.
1538   <S {Pol}.> This is too long.
1539  *<S {Ham}.> It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Pry-thee
1540  *say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
1541   sleepes. Say on; come to {Hecuba}.
1542  *<S 1.{Play}.> But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen.
1543   <S {Ham}.> The inobled Queene?
1544   <S {Pol}.> That's good: Inobled Queene is good.
1545   <S 1.{Play}.> Run bare- foot vp and downe,
1546   Threatning the flame
1547   With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
1548   Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
1549   About her lanke and all ore- teamed Loines,
1550   A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
1551   Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
1552  *'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
1553   But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
1554   When she saw {Pyrrhus} make malicious sport
1555   In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
1556   The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
1557   (Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)
1558   Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
1559   And passion in the Gods.
1560  *<S {Pol}.> Looke #where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and
1561   ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more.
1562  *<S {Ham}.> 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
1563  *soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel be-stow'd.
1564  *Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
1565  *the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After
1566  *your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
1567   their #ill report while you liued.
1568  *<S {Pol}.> My Lord, I will vse them according to their de-sart.
1569  _
1570  *<S {Ham}.> Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man
1571  *after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
1572  *them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they
1573  *deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them
1574   in.
1575   <S {Pol}.> Come sirs.  <D {Exit Polon}.>
1576  *<S {Ham}.> Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to mor-row.
1577  *Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the
1578   murther of {Gonzago}?
1579   <S {Play}.> #I my Lord.
1580  *<S {Ham}.> Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a
1581  *need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
1582   I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?
1583   <S {Play}.> #I my Lord.
1584  *<S {Ham}.> Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you
1585  *mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night
1586   you are welcome to {Elsonower}?
1587   <S {Rosin}.> Good my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1588   <D {Manet Hamlet}.>
1589   <S {Ham}.> #I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
1590   Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
1591   Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
1592   But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
1593   Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
1594   That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
1595   Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
1596   A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
1597   With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?
1598   For {Hecuba}?
1599   What's {Hecuba} to him, or he to {Hecuba},
1600   That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,
1601   Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
1602   That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,
1603   And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
1604   Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
1605   Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
1606   The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
1607   A dull and muddy- metled Rascall, peake
1608   Like Iohn a- dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
1609   And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
1610   Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
1611   A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?
1612   Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a- crosse?
1613   Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
1614   Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,
1615   As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
1616   Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
1617   But I am Pigeon- Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
1618   To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
1619   I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
1620   With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,
1621  *Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
1622   Oh Vengeance!
1623   Who? What an Asse am I? #I sure, this is most braue,
1624   That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,
1625   Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and #Hell,
1626   Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
1627   And fall #a Cursing like a very Drab.
1628   A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.
1629   I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
1630   Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,
1631   Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently
1632   They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
1633   For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake
1634   With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,
1635   Play something like the murder of my Father,
1636   Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,
1637   Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench
1638   I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
1639   May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power
1640   T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
1641   Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
1642   As he is very potent with such Spirits,
1643   Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds
1644   More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,
1645   Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.  <D {Exit}>
1646   <D {Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Ro-sincrance},
1647   {Guildenstern, and Lords}.>
1648   <S {King}.> And can you by no drift of circumstance
1649   Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
1650   Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
      <P oo5>
1651   With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy.
1652  *<S {Rosin}.> He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
1653   But from what cause he will by no meanes speake.
1654   <S {Guil}.> Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
1655   But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
1656   When we would bring him on to some Confession
1657   Of his true state.
1658   <S {Qu}.> Did he receiue you well?
1659   <S {Rosin}.> Most like a Gentleman.
1660   <S {Guild}.> But with much forcing of his disposition.
1661   <S {Rosin}.> Niggard of question, but of our demands
1662   Most free in his reply.
1663   <S {Qu}.> Did you assay him to any pastime?
1664   <S {Rosin}.> Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
1665   We ore- wrought on the way: of these we told him,
1666   And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
1667   To heare of it: They are about the Court,
1668   And (as I thinke) they haue already order
1669   This night to play before him.
1670   <S {Pol}.> 'Tis most true:
1671   And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
1672   To heare, and see the matter.
1673  *<S {King}.> With all my heart, and it doth much content me
1674   To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,
1675   Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on
1676   To these delights.
1677   <S {Rosin}.> We shall my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1678   <S {King}.> Sweet {Gertrude} leaue vs too,
1679   For we haue closely sent for {Hamlet} hither,
1680   That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
1681  *Affront {Ophelia}. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)
1682   Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
1683   We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
1684   And gather by him, as he is behaued,
1685   If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
1686   That thus he suffers for.
1687   <S {Qu}.> I shall obey you,
1688   And for your part {Ophelia}, I do wish
1689   That your good Beauties be the happy cause
1690   Of {Hamlets} wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
1691   Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
1692   To both your Honors.
1693   <S {Ophe}.> Madam, I wish it may.
1694  *<S {Pol}.> {Ophelia}, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
1695   We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
1696   That shew of such an exercise may colour
1697   Your lonelinesse. We are oft #too blame in this,
1698   'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
1699   And pious Action, we do surge o're
1700   The diuell himselfe.
1701   <S {King}.> Oh 'tis true:
1702  *How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
1703   The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring #Art
1704   Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
1705   Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
1706   Oh heauie burthen!
1707   <S {Pol}.> I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.
1708   <D {Exeunt}.>
1709   <D {Enter Hamlet}.>
1710   <S {Ham}.> To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
1711   Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
1712   The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
1713   Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
1714   And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
1715   No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
1716   The Heart- ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
1717   That Flesh is heyre #too? 'Tis a consummation
1718   Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
1719   To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; #I, there's the rub,
1720   For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
1721   When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,
1722   Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
1723   That makes Calamity of so long life:
1724   For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
1725   The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
1726   The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
1727   The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
1728   That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
1729   When he himselfe might his {Quietus} make
1730   With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
1731   To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
1732   But that the dread of something after death,
1733   The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
1734   No Traueller returnes, Puzels the #will,
1735   And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
1736   Then flye to others that we know not of.
1737   Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
1738   And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
1739   Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
1740   And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
1741   With this regard their Currants turne away,
1742   And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
1743   The faire {Ophelia}? Nimph, in thy Orizons
1744   Be all my sinnes remembred.
1745   <S {Ophe}.> Good my Lord,
1746   How does your Honor for this many a day?
1747   <S {Ham}.> I humbly thanke you: well, well, well.
1748   <S {Ophe}.> My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
1749   That I haue longed long to re- deliuer.
1750   I pray you now, receiue them.
1751   <S {Ham}.> No, no, I neuer gaue you ought.
1752   <S {Ophe}.> My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
1753   And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
1754   As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
1755   Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
1756   Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
1757   There my Lord.
1758   <S {Ham}.> Ha, ha: Are you honest?
1759   <S {Ophe}.> My Lord.
1760   <S {Ham}.> Are you faire?
1761   <S {Ophe}.> What meanes your Lordship?
1762  *<S {Ham}.> That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
1763   should admit no discourse to your Beautie.
1764  *<S {Ophe}.> Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
1765   then your Honestie?
1766  *<S {Ham}.> #I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
1767  *transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
1768  *force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
1769  *This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
1770   proofe. I did loue you once.
1771   <S {Ophe}.> Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so.
1772  *<S {Ham}.> You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
1773  *cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
1774   of it. I loued you not.
1775   <S {Ophe}.> I was the more deceiued.
1776  *<S {Ham}.> Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou
1777  *be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
1778  *but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were bet-ter
1779  *my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, re-uengefull,
1780  *Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
1781  *then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
1782  *them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such
      <P oo5v>
1783  *Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
1784  *We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
1785   wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?
1786   <S {Ophe}.> At home, my Lord.
1787  *<S {Ham}.> Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
1788   play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell.
1789   <S {Ophe}.> O helpe him, you sweet Heauens.
1790  *<S {Ham}.> If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
1791  *for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
1792  *thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
1793  *Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
1794  *for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
1795  *make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Far-well.
1796  _
1797   <S {Ophe}.> O heauenly Powers, restore him.
1798  *<S {Ham}.> I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
1799  *God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe an-other:
1800  *you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
1801  *Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ig-norance.
1802  *Go #too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
1803  *I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
1804  *married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
1805   as they are. To a Nunnery, go.  <D {Exit Hamlet}.>
1806  *<S {Ophe}.> O what a Noble minde is heere o're- throwne?
1807   The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
1808   Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
1809   The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
1810   Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
1811   Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
1812   That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
1813   Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
1814   Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
1815   That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
1816   Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
1817   T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
1818   <D {Enter King, and Polonius}.>
1819   <S {King}.> Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
1820   Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
1821  *Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
1822   O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
1823   And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
1824   Will be some danger, which to preuent
1825   I haue in quicke determination
1826   Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
1827   For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
1828   Haply the Seas and Countries different
1829   With variable Obiects, shall expell
1830   This something setled matter in his heart:
1831   Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
1832   From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?
1833   <S {Pol}.> It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
1834   The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
1835   Sprung from neglected loue. How now {Ophelia}?
1836   You neede not tell vs, what Lord {Hamlet} saide,
1837   We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
1838   But if you hold it fit after the Play,
1839   Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
1840   To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
1841   And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
1842   Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
1843   To England send him: Or confine him where
1844   Your wisedome best shall thinke.
1845   <S {King}.> It shall be so:
1846   Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.
1847   <D {Exeunt}.>
1848   <D {Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players}.>
1849  *<S {Ham}.> Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
1850  *it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
1851  *as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town- Cryer
1852  *had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
1853  *your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Tor-rent,
1854  *Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle- winde of
1855  *Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
1856  *may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,
1857  *to see a robustious Pery- wig- pated Fellow, teare a Passi-on
1858  *to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
1859  *Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
1860  *nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
1861  *haue such a Fellow whipt for o're- doing Termagant: it
1862   out-{#Herod's} {Herod}. Pray you auoid it.
1863   <S {Player}.> I warrant your Honor.
1864  *<S {Ham}.> Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
1865  *Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,
1866  *the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
1867  *That you ore- stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
1868  *thing so ouer- done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
1869  *end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
1870  *the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
1871  *Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
1872  *Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this
1873  *ouer- done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskil-full
1874  *laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
1875  *censure of the which One, must in your allowance o're-way
1876  *a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players
1877  *that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
1878  *highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
1879  *the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
1880  *or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
1881  *thought some of Natures Iouerney- men had made men,
1882  *and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so ab-hominably.
1883  _
1884  *<S {Play}.> I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
1885   vs, Sir.
1886  *<S {Ham}.> O reforme it altogether. And let those that
1887  *play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
1888  *them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
1889  *to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
1890  *too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
1891  *of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
1892  *shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
1893   it. Go make you readie.  <D {Exit Players}.>
1894   <D {Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne}.>
1895   How now my Lord,
1896   Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
1897   <S {Pol}.> And the Queene too, and that presently.
1898   <S {Ham}.> Bid the Players make #hast.  <D {Exit Polonius}.>
1899   Will you two helpe to hasten them?
1900   <S {Both}.> We will my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1901   <D {Enter Horatio}.>
1902   <S {Ham}.> What hoa, {Horatio}?
1903   <S {Hora}.> Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice.
1904   <S {Ham}.> {Horatio}, thou art eene as iust a man
1905   As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall.
1906   <S {Hora}.> O my deere Lord.
1907   <S {Ham}.> Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
1908   For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
1909   That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
      <P oo6>
1910  *To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
1911   No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
1912   And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
1913   Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
1914   Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
1915   And could of men distinguish, her election
1916   Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
1917   As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
1918   A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
1919   Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
1920   Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co- mingled,
1921   That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
1922   To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
1923   That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
1924   In my hearts Core. #I, in my Heart of heart,
1925   As I do thee. Something too much of this.
1926   There is a Play to night to before the King.
1927   One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
1928   Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
1929   I prythee,  when thou see'st that Acte a- foot,
1930   Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
1931   Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
1932   Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
1933   It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
1934   And my Imaginations are as foule
1935   As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
1936   For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
1937   And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
1938   To censure of his seeming.
1939   <S {Hora}.> Well my Lord.
1940   If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
1941   And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
1942   <D {Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance},
1943   {Guildensterne, and other Lords attendant with}
1944   {his Guard carrying Torches. Danish}
1945   {March. Sound a Flourish}.>
1946  *<S {Ham}.> They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
1947   Get you a place.
1948   <S {King}.> How fares our Cosin {Hamlet}?
1949  *<S {Ham}.> Excellent Ifaith,  of the Camelions dish: I eate
1950  *the Ayre promise- cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so.
1951  *<S {King}.> I haue nothing with this answer {Hamlet}, these
1952   words are not mine.
1953  *<S {Ham}.> No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once
1954   i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
1955  *<S {Polon}.> That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
1956   Actor.
1957   <S {Ham}.> And what did you enact?
1958  *<S {Pol}.> I did enact {Iulius Caesar}, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
1959   {Brutus} kill'd me.
1960  *<S {Ham}.> It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
1961   Calfe there. Be the Players ready?
1962   <S {Rosin}.> #I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience.
1963   <S {Qu}.> Come hither my good {Hamlet}, sit by me.
1964  *<S {Ha}.> No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue.
1965   <S {Pol}.> Oh ho, do you marke that?
1966   <S {Ham}.> Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
1967   <S {Ophe}.> No my Lord.
1968   <S {Ham}.> I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
1969   <S {Ophe}.> #I my Lord.
1970   <S {Ham}.> Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
1971   <S {Ophe}.> I thinke nothing, my Lord.
1972  *<S {Ham}.> That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs
1973   <S {Ophe}.> What is my Lord?
1974   <S {Ham}.> Nothing.
1975   <S {Ophe}.> You are merrie, my Lord?
1976   <S {Ham}.> Who I?
1977   <S {Ophe}.> #I my Lord.
1978  *<S {Ham}.> Oh God, your onely Iigge- maker: what should
1979  *a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheereful-ly
1980  *my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
1981   Houres.
1982   <S {Ophe}.> Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord.
1983  *<S {Ham}.> So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
1984  *for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two mo-neths
1985  *ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a
1986  *great mans Memorie, may out- liue his life halfe a yeare:
1987  *But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
1988  *he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby- horsse, whose
1989   Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby- horse is forgot.
1990   <D {Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters}.>
1991  *<D {Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embra-cing}

2003   <S {Ophe}.> What meanes this, my Lord?
2004  *<S {Ham}.> Marry this is Miching {Malicho}, that meanes
2005   Mischeefe.
2006  *<S {Ophe}.> Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
2007   Play?
2008  *<S {Ham}.> We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
2009   cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all.
2010   <S {Ophe}.> Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
2011  *<S {Ham}.> #I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
2012  *you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it
2013   meanes.
2014  *<S {Ophe}.> You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
2015   Play.
2016   <D {Enter Prologue}.>
2017   {For vs, and for our Tragedie},
2018   {Heere stooping to your Clemencie}:
2019   {We begge your hearing Patientlie}.
2020   <S {Ham}.> Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
2021   <S {Ophe}.> 'Tis briefe my Lord.
2022   <S {Ham}.> As Womans loue.
2023   <D {Enter King and his Queene}.>
2024  *<S {King}.> Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
2025   Neptunes salt Wash, and {Tellus} Orbed ground:
2026   And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
2027   About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
2028   Since loue our hearts, and {Hymen} did our hands
2029   Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands.
2030   <S {Bap}.> So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
2031   Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
2032   But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
2033   So farre from cheere, and from your former state,
2034   That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
2035   Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:
2036   For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
      <P oo6v>
2037   In neither ought, or in extremity:
2038   Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
2039   And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so.
2040  *<S {King}.> Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
2041   My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
2042   And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
2043   Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
2044   For Husband shalt thou===
2045   <S {Bap}.> Oh confound the rest:
2046   Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
2047   In second Husband, let me be accurst,
2048   None wed the second, but who kill'd the first.
2049   <S {Ham}.> Wormwood, Wormwood.
2050   <S {Bapt}.> The instances that second Marriage moue,
2051   Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
2052   A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
2053   When second Husband kisses me in Bed.
2054  *<S {King}.> I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
2055   But what we do determine, oft we breake:
2056   Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
2057   Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
2058   Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
2059   But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
2060   Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
2061   To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
2062   What to our selues in passion we propose,
2063   The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
2064   The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
2065   Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
2066   Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
2067   Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
2068   This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
2069   That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
2070   For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
2071   Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
2072   The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
2073   The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
2074   And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
2075   For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
2076   And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
2077   Directly seasons him his Enemie.
2078   But orderly to end, where I begun,
2079   Our #Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
2080   That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
2081   Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
2082   So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
2083   But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead.
2084   <S {Bap}.> Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
2085   Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
2086   Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
2087   Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
2088   Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
2089   If once a Widdow, euer I be Wise.
2090   <S {Ham}.> If she should breake it now.
2091   <S {King}.> 'Tis deepely sworne:
2092   Sweet, leaue me heere #a while,
2093   My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
2094   The tedious day with sleepe.
2095   <S {Qu}.> Sleepe rocke thy Braine,  <D {Sleepes}>
2096   And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.  <D {Exit}>
2097   <S {Ham}.> Madam, how like you this Play?
2098   <S {Qu}.> The Lady protests #to much me thinkes.
2099   <S {Ham}.> Oh but shee'l keepe her word.
2100  *<S {King}.> Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Of-fence
2101   in't?
2102  *<S {Ham}.> No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Of-fence
2103   i'th' world.
2104   <S {King}.> What do you call the Play?
2105   <S {Ham}.> The Mouse- trap: Marry how? Tropically:
2106  *This Play is the Image of a murder done in {Vienna}: {Gon-zago}
2107  *is the Dukes name, his wife {Baptista}: you shall see
2108  *anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
2109  *Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
2110  *vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
2111   <D {Enter Lucianus}.>
2112   This is one {Lucianus} nephew to the King.
2113   <S {Ophe}.> You are a good Chorus, my Lord.
2114  *<S {Ham}.> I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
2115   if I could see the Puppets dallying.
2116   <S {Ophe}.> You are keene my Lord, you are keene.
2117  *<S {Ham}.> It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
2118   edge.
2119   <S {Ophe}.> Still better and worse.
2120   <S {Ham}.> So you mistake Husbands.
2121  *Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
2122  *begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Re-uenge.
2123  _
2124   <S {Lucian}.> Thoughts blacke, hands apt,
2125   Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
2126   Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
2127   Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
2128   With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
2129   Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
2130   On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.
2131   <D {Powres the poyson in his eares}.>
2132  *<S {Ham}.> He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
2133  *name's {Gonzago}: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
2134  *Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
2135   loue of {Gonzago's} wife.
2136   <S {Ophe}.> The King rises.
2137   <S {Ham}.> What, frighted with false fire.
2138   <S {Qu}.> How fares my Lord?
2139   <S {Pol}.> Giue o're the Play.
2140   <S {King}.> Giue me some Light. Away.
2141   <S {All}.> Lights, Lights, Lights. <D {Exeunt}>
2142   <D {Manet Hamlet & Horatio}.>
2143   <S {Ham}.> Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,
2144   The Hart vngalled play:
2145   For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
2146   So runnes the world away.
2147  *Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
2148  *my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
2149  *Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
2150   of Players sir.
2151   <S {Hor}.> Halfe a share.
2152   <S {Ham}.> A whole one I,
2153   For thou dost know: Oh {Damon} deere,
2154   This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,
2155   And now reignes heere.
2156   A verie verie Paiocke.
2157   <S {Hora}.> You might haue Rim'd.
2158  *<S {Ham}.> Oh good {Horatio}, Ile take the Ghosts word for
2159   a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?
2160   <S {Hora}.> Verie well my Lord.
2161   <S {Ham}.> Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
2162   <S {Hora}.> I did verie well note him.
2163   <D {Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne}.>
2164  *<S {Ham}.> Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:
2165   For if the King like not the Comedie,
2166   Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
2167   Come some Musicke.
2168  *<S {Guild}.> Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
      <P pp1>
2169   <S {Ham}.> Sir, a whole History.
2170   <S {Guild}.> The King, sir.
2171   <S {Ham}.> #I sir, what of him?
2172   <S {Guild}.> Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd.
2173   <S {Ham}.> With drinke Sir?
2174   <S {Guild}.> No my Lord, rather with choller.
2175  *<S {Ham}.> Your wisedome should shew it selfe more ri-cher,
2176  *to signifie this to his Doctor:  for for me to put him
2177  *to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
2178   more Choller.
2179  *<S {Guild}.> Good my Lord put your discourse into some
2180   frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre.
2181   <S {Ham}.> I am tame Sir, pronounce.
2182  *<S {Guild}.> The Queene your Mother, in most great affli-ction
2183   of spirit, hath sent me to you.
2184   <S {Ham}.> You are welcome.
2185  *<S {Guild}.> Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
2186  *the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a whol-some
2187  *answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
2188  *if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
2189   my Businesse.
2190   <S {Ham}.> Sir, I cannot.
2191   <S {Guild}.> What, my Lord?
2192  *<S {Ham}.> Make you a wholsome answere: my wits dis-eas'd.
2193  *But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal com-mand:
2194  *or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
2195   but to the matter. My Mother you say.
2196  *<S {Rosin}.> Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke
2197   her into amazement, and admiration.
2198  *<S {Ham}.> Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a
2199  *Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mo-thers
2200   admiration?
2201  *<S {Rosin}.> She desires to speake with you in her Closset,
2202   ere you go to bed.
2203  *<S {Ham}.> We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
2204   Haue you any further Trade with vs?
2205   <S {Rosin}.> My Lord, you once did loue me.
2206   <S {Ham}.> So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
2207  *<S {Rosin}.> Good my Lord, what is your cause of distem-per?
2208  *You do freely barre the doore of your owne Liber-tie,
2209   if you deny your greefes to your Friend.
2210   <S {Ham}.> Sir I lacke Aduancement.
2211  *<S {Rosin}.> How can that be, when you haue the voyce of
2212   the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
2213  *<S {Ham}.> #I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is
2214   something musty.
2215   <D {Enter one with a Recorder}.>
2216  *O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
2217  *do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
2218   would driue me into a toyle?
2219  *<S {Guild}.> O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
2220   is too vnmannerly.
2221  *<S {Ham}.> I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
2222   vpon this Pipe?
2223   <S {Guild}.> My Lord, I cannot.
2224   <S {Ham}.> I pray you.
2225   <S {Guild}.> Beleeue me, I cannot.
2226   <S {Ham}.> I do beseech you.
2227   <S {Guild}.> I know no touch of it, my Lord.
2228  *<S {Ham}.> 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
2229  *with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
2230  *mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
2231   Looke you, these are the stoppes.
2232  *<S {Guild}.> But these cannot I command to any vtterance
2233   of hermony, I haue not the skill.
2234  *<S {Ham}.> Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
2235  *you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
2236  *seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
2237  *of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
2238  *Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Mu-sicke,
2239  *excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
2240  *you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
2241  *plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
2242  *though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God
2243   blesse you Sir.
2244   <D {Enter Polonius}.>
2245  *<S {Polon}.> My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,
2246   and presently.
2247  *<S {Ham}.> Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
2248   like a Camell.
2249   <S {Polon}.> By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed.
2250   <S {Ham}.> Me thinkes it is like a Weazell.
2251   <S {Polon}.> It is back'd like a Weazell.
2252   <S {Ham}.> Or like a Whale?
2253   <S {Polon}.> Verie like a Whale.
2254   <S {Ham}.> Then will I come to my Mother, #by and by:
2255   They foole me to the top of my bent.
2256   I will come #by and by.
2257   <S {Polon}.> I will say so.  <D {Exit}.>
2258   <S {Ham}.> #By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:
2259   'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
2260   When Churchyards yawne, and #Hell it selfe breaths out
2261  *Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
2262   And do such bitter businesse as the day
2263   Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
2264   Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
2265   The Soule of {Nero}, enter this firme bosome:
2266   Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
2267   I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
2268   My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
2269   How in my words someuer she be shent,
2270   To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
2271   <D {Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne}.>
2272   <S {King}.> I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
2273   To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
2274   I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
2275   And he to England shall along with you:
2276   The termes of our estate, may not endure
2277   Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
2278   Out of his Lunacies.
2279   <S {Guild}.> We will our selues prouide:
2280   Most holie and Religious feare it is
2281   To keepe those many many bodies safe
2282   That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie.
2283   <S {Rosin}.> The single
2284   And peculiar life is bound
2285   With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
2286   To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
2287   That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
2288   The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
2289   Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
2290   What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
2291   Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
2292   To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
2293   Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
2294   Each small annexment, pettie consequence
2295   Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
2296   Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone.
2297  *<S {King}.> Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
2298   For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
      <P pp1v>
2299   Which now goes too free- footed.
2300   <S {Both}.> We will haste vs.  <D {Exeunt Gent}.>
2301   <D {Enter Polonius}.>
2302   <S {Pol}.> My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
2303   Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
2304  *To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
2305   And as you said, and wisely was it said,
2306   'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
2307   Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're- heare
2308   The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
2309   Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
2310   And tell you what I know.
2311   <S {King}.> Thankes deere my Lord.
2312   Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
2313   It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
2314   A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
2315   Though inclination be as sharpe as #will:
2316   My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
2317   And like a man to double businesse bound,
2318   I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
2319   And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
2320   Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
2321   Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
2322   To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
2323   But to confront the visage of Offence?
2324   And what's in Prayer, but this two- fold force,
2325   To be fore- stalled ere we come to fall,
2326   Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
2327   My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
2328   Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
2329   That cannot be, since I am still possest
2330   Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
2331   My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
2332   May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
2333   In the corrupted currants of this world,
2334   Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
2335   And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
2336   Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
2337   There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
2338   In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
2339   Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
2340   To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
2341   Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
2342   Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
2343   Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
2344   Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
2345   Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
2346   Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
2347   Be soft as sinewes of the new- borne Babe,
2348   All may be well.
2349   <D {Enter Hamlet}.>
2350   <S {Ham}.> Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
2351   And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
2352   And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
2353   A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
2354   I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
2355   To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
2356   He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
2357   With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as #May,
2358   And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
2359   But in our circumstance and course of thought
2360   'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
2361   To take him in the purging of his Soule,
2362   When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.
2363   Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
2364   When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
2365   Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,
2366   At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
2367   That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
2368   Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
2369   And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
2370   As #Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
2371   This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.  <D {Exit}.>
2372  *<S {King}.> My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
2373   Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.  <D {Exit}.>
2374   <D {Enter Queene and Polonius}.>
2375   <S {Pol}.> He will come straight:
2376   Looke you lay home to him,
2377  *Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
2378  *And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
2379   Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
2380   Pray you be round with him.
2381   <S {Ham}. {within}.> Mother, mother, mother.
2382   <S {Qu}.> Ile warrant you, feare me not.
2383   Withdraw, I heare him coming.
2384   <D {Enter Hamlet}.>
2385   <S {Ham}.> Now Mother, what's the matter?
2386   <S {Qu}.> {Hamlet}, thou hast thy Father much offended.
2387   <S {Ham}.> Mother, you haue my Father much offended.
2388   <S {Qu}.> Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
2389   <S {Ham}.> Go, go, you question with an idle tongue.
2390   <S {Qu}.> Why how now {Hamlet}?
2391   <S {Ham}.> Whats the matter now?
2392   <S {Qu}.> Haue you forgot me?
2393   <S {Ham}.> No by the Rood, not so:
2394   You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
2395   But would you were not so. You are my Mother.
2396   <S {Qu}.> Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake.
2397   <S {Ham}.> Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not
2398   boudge:
2399   You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
2400   Where you may see the inmost part of you?
2401  *<S {Qu}.> What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
2402   Helpe, helpe, hoa.
2403   <S {Pol}.> What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe.
2404   <S {Ham}.> How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead.
2405   <S {Pol}.> Oh I am slaine.  <D {Killes Polonius}.>
2406   <S {Qu}.> Oh me, what hast thou done?
2407   <S {Ham}.> Nay I know not, is it the King?
2408   <S {Qu}.> Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
2409   <S {Ham}.> A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
2410   As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother.
2411   <S {Qu}.> As kill a King?
2412   <S {Ham}.> #I Lady, 'twas my word.
2413   Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
2414   I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
2415   Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
2416   Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
2417   And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
2418   If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
2419   If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
2420   That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense.
2421  *<S {Qu}.> What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
2422   In noise so rude against me?
2423   <S {Ham}.> Such an Act
2424   That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
2425   Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
2426   From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
2427   And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
2428   As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
      <P pp2>
2429   As from the body of Contraction pluckes
2430   The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
2431   A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
2432   Yea this solidity and compound masse,
2433   With tristfull visage as against the doome,
2434   Is thought- sicke at the act.
2435  *<S {Qu}.> Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thun-ders
2436   in the Index.
2437   <S {Ham}.> Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
2438   The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
2439   See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
2440   {Hyperions} curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
2441   An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
2442   A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
2443   New lighted on a heauen- kissing hill:
2444   A Combination, and a forme indeed,
2445   Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
2446   To giue the world assurance of a man.
2447  *This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
2448   Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
2449   Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
2450   Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
2451   And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
2452   You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
2453   The hey- day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
2454   And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
2455   Would step from this, to this? What diuell #was't,
2456   That thus hath cousend you at hoodman- blinde?
2457   O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious #Hell,
2458   If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
2459   To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
2460   And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
2461   When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
2462   Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
2463   As Reason panders #Will.
2464   <S {Qu}.> O {Hamlet}, speake no more.
2465   Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
2466   And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
2467   As will not leaue their Tinct.
2468   <S {Ham}.> Nay, but to liue
2469   In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
2470   Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
2471   Ouer the nasty Stye.
2472   <S {Qu}.> Oh speake to me, no more,
2473   These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
2474   No more sweet {Hamlet}.
2475   <S {Ham}.> A Murderer, and a Villaine:
2476   A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe
2477   Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
2478   A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
2479   That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
2480   And put it in his Pocket.
2481   <S {Qu}.> No more.
2482   <D {Enter Ghost}.>
2483   <S {Ham}.> A King of shreds and patches.
2484   Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
2485  *You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?
2486   <S {Qu}.> Alas he's mad.
2487   <S {Ham}.> Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
2488   That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
2489   Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say.
2490   <S {Ghost}.> Do not forget: this Visitation
2491   Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
2492   But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
2493   O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
2494   Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
2495   Speake to her {Hamlet}.
2496   <S {Ham}.> How is it with you Lady?
2497   <S {Qu}.> Alas, how is't with you?
2498   That you bend your eye on vacancie,
2499   And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
2500   Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
2501   And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
2502   Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
2503   Start vp, and stand #an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
2504   Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
2505   Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
2506  *<S {Ham}.> On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
2507   His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
2508   Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
2509   Least with this pitteous action you conuert
2510   My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
2511   Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood.
2512   <S {Qu}.> To who do you speake this?
2513   <S {Ham}.> Do you see nothing there?
2514   <S {Qu}.> Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.
2515   <S {Ham}.> Nor did you nothing heare?
2516   <S {Qu}.> No, nothing but our selues.
2517  *<S {Ham}.> Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
2518   My Father in his habite, as he liued,
2519  *Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.  <D {Exit}.>
2520   <S {Qu}.> This is the very coynage of your Braine,
2521   This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in.
2522   <S {Ham}.> Extasie?
2523   My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
2524   And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
2525   That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
2526   And I the matter will re- word: which madnesse
2527   Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
2528   Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
2529   That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
2530   It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
2531   Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
2532   Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
2533   Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
2534   And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
2535   To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
2536   For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
2537   Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
2538   Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good.
2539   <S {Qu}.> Oh {Hamlet},
2540   Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine.
2541   <S {Ham}.> O throw away the worser part of it,
2542   And liue the purer with the other halfe.
2543   Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
2544   Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
2545   And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
2546   To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,
2547   And when you are desirous to be blest,
2548   Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
2549   I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
2550   To punish me with this, and this with me,
2551   That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
2552   I will bestow him, and will answer well
2553   The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
2554   I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
2555   Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde.
2556   <S {Qu}.> What shall I do?
2557   <S {Ham}.> Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
2558   Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
2559   Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
2560   And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
      <P pp2v>
2561   Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
2562   Make you to rauell all this matter out,
2563   That I essentially am not in madnesse,
2564   But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
2565   For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
2566   Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
2567   Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
2568   No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
2569   Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
2570   Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
2571   To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
2572   And breake your owne necke downe.
2573   <S {Qu}.> Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
2574   And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
2575   What thou hast saide to me.
2576   <S {Ham}.> I must to England, you know that?
2577   <S {Qu}.> Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on.
2578   <S {Ham}.> This man shall set me packing:
2579   Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
2580   Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
2581   Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
2582   Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
2583   Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
2584   Good night Mother.
2585   <D {Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius}.>
2586   <D {Enter King}.>
2587   <S {King}.> There's matters in these sighes.
2588   These profound heaues
2589   You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
2590   Where is your Sonne?
2591  *<S {Qu}.> Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
2592   <S {King}.> What {Gertrude}? How do's {Hamlet}?
2593  *<S {Qu}.> Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
2594   Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
2595   Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
2596   He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
2597   And in his brainish apprehension killes
2598   The vnseene good old man.
2599   <S {King}.> Oh heauy deed:
2600   It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
2601   His Liberty is full of threats to all,
2602   To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
2603   Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
2604   It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
2605   Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
2606   This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
2607   We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
2608   But like the Owner of a foule disease,
2609   To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
2610   Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
2611   <S {Qu}.> To draw apart the body he hath kild,
2612   O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
2613   Among a Minerall of Mettels base
2614   Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done.
2615   <S {King}.> Oh {Gertrude}, come away:
2616   The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
2617   But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
2618   We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
2619   Both countenance, and excuse.  <D {Enter Ros. & Guild}.>
2620   Ho {Guildenstern}:
2621   Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
2622   {#Hamlet} in madnesse hath {Polonius} slaine,
2623   And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
2624   Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
2625   Into the Chappell. I pray you #hast in this.  <D {Exit Gent}.>
2626   Come {Gertrude}, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
2627   To let them know both what we meane to do,
2628   And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
2629   My soule is full of discord and dismay.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2630   <D {Enter Hamlet}.>
2631   <S {Ham}.> Safely stowed.
2632   <S {Gentlemen} {within}.> {Hamlet}, Lord {Hamlet}.
2633   <S {Ham}.> What noise? Who cals on {Hamlet}?
2634   Oh heere they come.  <D {Enter Ros. and Guildensterne}.>
2635  *<S {Ro}.> What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
2636  *<S {Ham}.> Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne.
2637  *<S {Rosin}.> Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
2638   And beare it to the Chappell.
2639   <S {Ham}.> Do not beleeue it.
2640   <S {Rosin}.> Beleeue what?
2641  *<S {Ham}.> That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine
2642  *owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what re-plication
2643   should be made by the Sonne of a King.
2644   <S {Rosin}.> Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
2645  *<S {Ham}.> #I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
2646  *Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
2647  *best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in
2648  *the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
2649  *when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squee-zing
2650   you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe.
2651   <S {Rosin}.> I vnderstand you not my Lord.
2652  *<S {Ham}.> I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
2653   foolish eare.
2654  *<S {Rosin}.> My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,
2655   and go with vs to the King.
2656  *<S {Ham}.> The body is with the King, but the King is not
2657   with the body. The King, is a thing===
2658   <S {Guild}.> A thing my Lord?
2659  *<S {Ham}.> Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
2660   after.  <D {Exeunt}>
2661   <D {Enter King}.>
2662  *<S {King}.> I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
2663   How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
2664   Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
2665   Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
2666   Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
2667   And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
2668   But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
2669   This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
2670   Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
2671   By desperate appliance are releeued,
2672   Or not at all. <D {Enter Rosincrane}.>
2673   How now? What hath befalne?
2674   <S {Rosin}.> Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
2675   We cannot get from him.
2676   <S {King}.> But where is he?
2677   <S {Rosin}.> Without my Lord, guarded to know your
2678   pleasure.
2679   <S {King}.> Bring him before vs.
2680   <S {Rosin}.> Hoa, {Guildensterne}? Bring in my Lord.
2681   <D {Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne}.>
2682   <S {King}.> Now {Hamlet}, where's {Polonius}?
2683   <S {Ham}.> At Supper.
2684   <S {King}.> At Supper? Where?
2685  *<S {Ham}.> Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a cer-taine
2686  *conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm
2687  *is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
2688  *to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,
2689  *and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
2690   but to one Table that's the end.
2691   <S {King}.> What dost thou meane by this?
      <P pp3>
2692  *<S {Ham}.> Nothing but to shew you how a King may go
2693   a Progresse through the guts of a Begger.
2694   <S {King}.> Where is {Polonius}.
2695  *<S {Ham}.> In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messen-ger
2696  *finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your
2697  *selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you
2698   shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby.
2699   <S {King}.> Go seeke him there.
2700   <S {Ham}.> He will stay till ye come.
2701  *<S {K}.> {Hamlet}, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
2702   Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
2703   For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
2704   With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,
2705   The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
2706   Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent
2707   For England.
2708   <S {Ham}.> For England?
2709   <S {King}.> #I {Hamlet}.
2710   <S {Ham}.> Good.
2711   <S {King}.> So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
2712  *<S {Ham}.> I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
2713   England. Farewell deere Mother.
2714   <S {King}.> Thy louing Father {Hamlet}.
2715  *<S {Hamlet}.> My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
2716  *wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
2717   for England.  <D {Exit}>
2718   <S {King}.> Follow him at foote,
2719   Tempt him with speed aboord:
2720   Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
2721   Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
2722   That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make #hast.
2723   And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
2724   As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
2725   Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
2726   After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
2727   Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
2728   Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
2729   By Letters coniuring to that effect
2730   The present death of {Hamlet}. Do it England,
2731   For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
2732   And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
2733   How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.  <D {Exit}>
2734   <D {Enter Fortinbras with an Armie}.>
2735   <S {For}.> Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
2736   Tell him that by his license, {Fortinbras}
2737   Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
2738   Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
2739   If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
2740   We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
2741   And let him know so.
2742   <S {Cap}.> I will doo't, my Lord.
2743   <S {For}.> Go safely on.  <D {Exit}.>
2744   <D {Enter Queene and Horatio}.>
2745   <S {Qu}.> I will not speake with her.
2746  *<S {Hor}.> She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode
2747   will needs be pittied.
2748   <S {Qu}.> What would she haue?
2749  *<S {Hor}.> She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
2750  *There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
2751   Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
2752   That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
2753   Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
2754   The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
2755   And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
2756  *Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
2757  *Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
2758   Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily.
2759   <S {Qu}.> 'Twere good she were spoken with,
2760   For she may strew dangerous coniectures
2761   In #ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
2762   To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)
2763   Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
2764   So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
2765   It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
2766   <D {Enter Ophelia distracted}.>
2767  *<S {Ophe}.> Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark.
2768   <S {Qu}.> How now {Ophelia}?
2769  *<S {Ophe}.> {How should I your true loue know from another one}?
2770   {By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone}.
2771   <S {Qu}.> Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
2772   <S {Ophe}.> Say you? Nay pray you marke.
2773   {He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone},
2774   {At his head a grasse- greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone}.
2775   <D {Enter King}.>
2776   <S {Qu}.> Nay but {Ophelia}.
2777   <S {Ophe}.> Pray you marke.
2778   {White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow}.
2779   <S {Qu}.> Alas, looke heere my Lord.
2780   <S {Ophe}.> {Larded with sweet Flowers}:
2781   {Which bewept to the graue did not go},
2782   {With true- loue showres}.
2783   <S {King}.> How do ye, pretty Lady?
2784  *<S {Ophe}.> Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
2785  *a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
2786   know not what we may be. God be at your Table.
2787   <S {King}.> Conceit vpon her Father.
2788  *<S {Ophe}.> Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when
2789   they aske you what it meanes, say you this:
2790   {To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, all in the morning betime},
2791   {And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine}.
2792  *{Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore},
2793   {Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more}.
2794   <S {King}.> Pretty {Ophelia}.
2795  *<S {Ophe}.> Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont.
2796   {By gis, and by S[aint]. Charity},
2797   {Alacke, and fie for shame}:
2798   {Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't},
2799   {By Cocke they are #too blame}.
2800   {Quoth she before you tumbled me},
2801   {You promis'd me to Wed}:
2802   {So would I #ha done by yonder Sunne},
2803   {#And thou hadst not come to my bed}.
2804   <S {King}.> How long hath she bin thus?
2805  *<S {Ophe}.> I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,
2806  *but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
2807  *lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
2808  *and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my
2809  *Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
2810   Goodnight, goodnight.  <D {Exit}.>
2811   <S {King}.> Follow her close,
2812   Giue her good watch I pray you:
2813   Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
2814   All from her Fathers death. Oh {Gertrude}, {Gertrude},
2815   When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
2816   But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine,
2817   Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
2818   Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
2819  *Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
2820  *For good {Polonius} death; and we haue done but greenly
2821   In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore {Ophelia}
2822   Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
      <P pp3v>
2823   Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
2824   Last, and as much containing as all these,
2825   Her Brother is in secret come from France,
2826   Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
2827   And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
2828   With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
2829   Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
2830   Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
2831   In eare and eare. O my deere {Gertrude}, this,
2832   Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
2833   Giues me superfluous death.  <D {A Noise within}.>
2834   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2835   <S {Qu}.> Alacke, what noyse is this?
2836   <S {King}.> Where are my {Switzers}?
2837   Let them guard the doore. What is the matter?
2838   <S {Mes}.> Saue your selfe, my Lord.
2839   The Ocean (ouer- peering of his List)
2840   Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
2841   Then young {Laertes}, in a Riotous head,
2842   Ore- beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
2843   And as the world were now but to begin,
2844   Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
2845   The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
2846   They cry choose we? {Laertes} shall be King,
2847   Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
2848   {Laertes} shall be King, {Laertes} King.
2849   <S {Qu}.> How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
2850   Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.
2851   <D {Noise within. Enter Laertes}.>
2852   <S {King}.> The doores are broke.
2853  *<S {Laer}.> Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without.
2854   <S {All}.> No, let's come in.
2855   <S {Laer}.> I pray you giue me leaue.
2856   <S {Al}.> We will, we will.
2857   <S {Laer}.> I thanke you: Keepe the doore.
2858   Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father.
2859   <S {Qu}.> Calmely good {Laertes}.
2860   <S {Laer}.> That drop of blood, that calmes
2861   Proclaimes me Bastard:
2862   Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
2863   Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
2864   Of my true Mother.
2865   <S {King}.> What is the cause {Laertes},
2866   That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant- like?
2867   Let him go {Gertrude}: Do not feare our person:
2868   There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
2869   That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
2870   Acts little of his #will. Tell me {Laertes},
2871   Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go {Gertrude}.
2872   Speake man.
2873   <S {Laer}.> Where's my Father?
2874   <S {King}.> Dead.
2875   <S {Qu}.> But not by him.
2876   <S {King}.> Let him demand his fill.
2877   <S {Laer}.> How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
2878   To #hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
2879   Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
2880   I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
2881   That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
2882   Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
2883   Most throughly for my Father.
2884   <S {King}.> Who shall stay you?
2885   <S {Laer}.> My #Will, not all the world,
2886   And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
2887   They shall go farre with little.
2888   <S {King}.> Good {Laertes}:
2889   If you desire to know the certaintie
2890   Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
2891   That Soop- stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
2892   Winner and Looser.
2893   <S {Laer}.> None but his Enemies.
2894   <S {King}.> Will you know them then.
2895  *<S {La}.> To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
2896   And like the kinde Life- rend'ring Politician,
2897   Repast them with my blood.
2898   <S {King}.> Why now you speake
2899   Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
2900   That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
2901   And am most sensible in greefe for it,
2902   It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
2903   As day do's to your eye.
2904   <D {A noise within. Let her come in}.>
2905   <D {Enter Ophelia}.>
2906   <S {Laer}.> How now? what noise is that?
2907   Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
2908   Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
2909   By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
2910   Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of #May,
2911   Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet {Ophelia}:
2912   Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
2913   Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
2914   Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
2915   It sends some precious instance of it selfe
2916   After the thing it loues.
2917   <S {Ophe}.> {They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer},
2918   {Hey non nony, nony, hey nony}:
2919   {And on his graue raines many a teare},
2920   {Fare you well my Doue}.
2921  *<S {Laer}.> Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Re-uenge,
2922   it could not moue thus.
2923  *<S {Ophe}.> You must sing downe a- downe, #and you call
2924  *him a- downe- a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is
2925   the false Steward that stole his masters daughter.
2926   <S {Laer}.> This nothings more then matter.
2927  *<S {Ophe}.> There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
2928  *Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
2929   Thoughts.
2930  *<S {Laer}.> A document in madnesse, thoughts & remem-brance
2931   fitted.
2932  *<S {Ophe}.> There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
2933  *Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
2934  *Herbe- Grace #a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
2935  *with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you
2936  *some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dy-ed:
2937   They say, he made a good end;
2938   {For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy}.
2939  *<S {Laer}.> Thought, and Affliction, Passion, #Hell it selfe:
2940   She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse.
2941   <S {Ophe}.> {And will he not come againe},
2942   {And will he not come againe}:
2943   {No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death- bed},
2944   {He neuer wil come againe}.
2945   {His Beard as white as Snow},
2946   {All Flaxen was his Pole}:
2947   {He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone},
2948   {Gramercy on his Soule}.
2949   And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
2950   God buy ye.  <D {Exeunt Ophelia}>
2951   <S {Laer}.> Do you see this, you Gods?
2952   <S {King}.> {Laertes}, I must common with your greefe,
2953   Or you deny me right: go but apart,
      <P pp4>
2954   Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
2955   And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
2956   If by direct or by Colaterall hand
2957   They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
2958   Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
2959   To you in satisfaction. But if not,
2960   Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
2961   And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
2962   To giue it due content.
2963   <S {Laer}.> Let this be so:
2964   His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
2965   No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
2966   No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
2967   Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
2968   That I must call in question.
2969   <S {King}.> So you shall:
2970   And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
2971   I pray you go with me.  <D {Exeunt}>
2972   <D {Enter Horatio, with an Attendant}.>
2973   <S {Hora}.> What are they that would speake with me?
2974   <S {Ser}.> Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you.
2975   <S {Hor}.> Let them come in,
2976   I do not know from what part of the world
2977   I should be greeted, if not from Lord {Hamlet}.
2978   <D {Enter Saylor}.>
2979   <S {Say}.> God blesse you Sir.
2980   <S {Hor}.> Let him blesse thee too.
2981  *<S {Say}.> Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter
2982  *for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
2983  *bound for England, if your name be {Horatio}, as I am let
2984   to know it is.
2985   <D {Reads the Letter}.>
2986  *Horatio, {When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these}
2987  *{Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters}
2988  *{for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very}
2989  *{Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too}
2990  *{slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I}
2991  *{boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so}
2992  *{I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like}
2993  *{Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe}
2994  *{a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue}
2995  *{sent, and repaire thou to me with as much #hast as thou wouldest}
2996  *{flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee}
2997  *{dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter}.
2998  *{These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am}. Rosincrance
2999  *{and} Guildensterne, {hold their course for England. Of them}
3000   {I haue much to tell thee, Farewell}.
3001   {He that thou knowest thine},
3002   Hamlet.
3003   Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
3004   And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
3005   To him from whom you brought them.  <D {Exit}.>
3006   <D {Enter King and Laertes}.>
3007  *<S {King}.> Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
3008   And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
3009   Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
3010   That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
3011   Pursued my life.
3012   <S {Laer}.> It well appeares. But tell me,
3013   Why you proceeded not against these feates,
3014   So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
3015   As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
3016   You mainly were stirr'd vp?
3017   <S {King}.> O for two speciall Reasons,
3018  *Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,
3019  *And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
3020   Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
3021   My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
3022   She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
3023   That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
3024   I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
3025   Why to a publike count I might not go,
3026   Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
3027   Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
3028   Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
3029   Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
3030   Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
3031   Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
3032   And not where I had arm'd them.
3033   <S {Laer}.> And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
3034   A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
3035   Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
3036   Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
3037   For her perfections. But my reuenge will come.
3038   <S {King}.> Breake not your sleepes for that,
3039   You must not thinke
3040   That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
3041   That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
3042   And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
3043   I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
3044   And that I hope will teach you to imagine===
3045   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
3046   How now? What Newes?
3047   <S {Mes}.> Letters my Lord from {Hamlet}, This to your
3048   Maiesty: this to the Queene.
3049   <S {King}.> From {Hamlet}? Who brought them?
3050   <S {Mes}.> Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
3051   They were giuen me by {Claudio}, he receiu'd them.
3052   <S {King}.> {Laertes} you shall heare them:
3053   Leaue vs.  <D {Exit Messenger}>
3054  *{High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your}
3055  *{Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly}
3056  *{Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) re-count}
3057   {th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne}.
3058   Hamlet.
3059   What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
3060   Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
3061   <S {Laer}.> Know you the hand?
      <C I>
3062  *<S {Kin}.> 'Tis {Hamlets} Character, naked and in a Post-script
3063   here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
3064   <S {Laer}.> I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
3065   It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
3066   That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
3067   Thus diddest thou.
3068   <S {Kin}.> If it be so {Laertes}, as how should it be so:
3069   How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
3070   <S {Laer}.> If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace.
3071   <S {Kin}.> To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
3072   As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
3073   No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
3074   To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
3075   Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
3076   And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
3077   But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
3078   And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
3079   Here was a Gentleman of {Normandy},
3080   I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
3081   And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
      <P pp4v>
3082   Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
3083   And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
3084   As had he beene encorps't and demy- Natur'd
3085   With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
3086   That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
3087   Come short of what he did.
3088   <S {Laer}.> A Norman #was't?
3089   <S {Kin}.> A Norman.
3090   <S {Laer}.> Vpon my life {Lamound}.
3091   <S {Kin}.> The very same.
3092   <S {Laer}.> I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
3093   And Iemme of all our Nation.
3094   <S {Kin}.> Hee mad confession of you,
3095   And gaue you such a Masterly report,
3096   For #Art and exercise in your defence;
3097   And for your Rapier most especiall,
3098   That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
3099   If one could match you Sir. This report of his
3100   Did {Hamlet} so envenom with his Enuy,
3101   That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
3102   Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
3103   Now out of this.
3104   <S {Laer}.> Why out of this, my Lord?
3105   <S {Kin}.> {Laertes} was your Father deare to you?
3106   Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
3107   A face without a heart?
3108   <S {Laer}.> Why aske you this?
3109  *<S {Kin}.> Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
3110   But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
3111   And that I see in passages of proofe,
3112   Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
3113   {#Hamlet} comes backe: what would you vndertake,
3114   To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
3115   More then in words?
3116   <S {Laer}.> To cut his throat i'th' Church.
3117   <S {Kin}.> No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
3118   Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good {Laertes}
3119   Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
3120   {#Hamlet} return'd, shall know you are come home:
3121   Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
3122   And set a double varnish on the fame
3123   The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
3124   And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
3125   Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
3126   Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
3127   Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
3128   A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
3129   Requit him for your Father.
3130   <S {Laer}.> I will doo't.
3131   And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
3132   I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
3133   So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
3134   Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
3135   Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
3136   Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
3137   That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
3138   With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
3139   It may be death.
3140   <S {Kin}.> Let's further thinke of this,
3141   Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
3142   May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
3143   And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
3144   'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
3145   Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
3146   If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
3147   Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
3148   I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,
3149   As make your bowts more violent to the end,
3150   And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
3151   A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
3152   If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
3153   Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
3154   <D {Enter Queene}.>
3155   <S {Queen}.> One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
3156   So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd {Laertes}.
3157   <S {Laer}.> Drown'd! O where?
3158   <S {Queen}.> There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
3159   That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
3160   There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
3161   Of Crow- flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
3162   That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
3163   But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
3164   There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
3165   Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
3166   When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
3167   Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
3168   And Mermaid- like, #a while they bore her vp,
3169   Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
3170   As one incapable of her owne distresse,
3171   Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
3172   Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
3173   Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
3174   Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
3175   To muddy death.
3176   <S {Laer}.> Alas then, is she drown'd?
3177   <S {Queen}.> Drown'd, drown'd.
3178   <S {Laer}.> Too much of water hast thou poore {Ophelia},
3179   And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
3180   It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
3181   Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
3182   The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
3183   I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
3184   But that this folly doubts it.  <D {Exit}.>
3185   <S {Kin}.> Let's follow, {Gertrude}:
3186   How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
3187   Now feare I this will giue it start againe;
3188   Therefore let's follow.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3189   <D {Enter two Clownes}.>
3190  *<S {Clown}.> Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
3191   wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
3192  *<S {Other}.> I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
3193  *straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Chri-stian
3194   buriall.
3195  *<S {Clo}.> How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
3196   her owne defence?
3197   <S {Other}.> Why 'tis found so.
3198  *<S {Clo}.> It must be {Se offendendo}, it cannot bee else: for
3199  *heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it ar-gues
3200  *an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
3201  *Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
3202   wittingly.
3203   <S {Other}.> Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer.
3204  *<S {Clown}.> Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
3205  *heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this wa-ter
3206  *and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
3207  *marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne
3208  *him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not
3209   guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life.
3210   <S {Other}.> But is this law?
3211   <S {Clo}.> #I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law.
      <P pp5><C E>
3212  *<S {Other}.> Will you #ha the truth on't: if this had not
3213  *beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
3214   out of Christian Buriall.
3215  *<S {Clo}.> Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that
3216  *great folke should haue countenance in this world to
3217  *drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christi-an.
3218  *Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
3219  *but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue- makers; they hold vp
3220   {Adams} Profession.
3221   <S {Other}.> Was he a Gentleman?
3222   <S {Clo}.> He was the first that euer bore Armes.
3223   <S {Other}.> Why he had none.
3224  *<S {Clo}.> What, #ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnder-stand
3225  *the Scripture? the Scripture sayes {Adam} dig'd;
3226  *could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another que-stion
3227  *to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, con-fesse
3228   thy selfe===
3229   <S {Other}.> Go #too.
3230  *<S {Clo}.> What is he that builds stronger then either the
3231   Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
3232  *<S {Other}.> The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a
3233   thousand Tenants.
3234  *<S {Clo}.> I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
3235  *does well; but how does it well? it does well to those
3236  *that doe #ill: now, thou dost #ill to say the Gallowes is
3237  *built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
3238   may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come.
3239  *<S {Other}.> Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Ship-wright,
3240   or a Carpenter?
3241   <S {Clo}.> #I, tell me that, and vnyoake.
3242   <S {Other}.> Marry, now I can tell.
3243   <S {Clo}.> Too't.
3244   <S {Other}.> Masse, I cannot tell.
3245   <D {Enter Hamlet and Horatio #a farre off}.>
3246  *<S {Clo}.> Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
3247  *dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
3248  *you are ask't this question next, say a Graue- maker: the
3249  *Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
3250   to {Yaughan}, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.
3251   <D {Sings}.>
3252   {In youth when I did loue, did loue},
3253   {me thought it was very sweete}:
3254   {To contract O the time for #a my behoue},
3255   {O me thought there was nothing meete}.
3256  *<S {Ham}.> Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that
3257   he sings at Graue- making?
3258  *<S {Hor}.> Custome hath made it in him a property of ea-sinesse.
3259  _
3260  *<S {Ham}.> 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
3261   the daintier sense.
3262   <S {Clowne sings}.>
3263   {But Age with his stealing steps}
3264   {hath caught me in his clutch}:
3265   {And hath shipped me intill the Land},
3266   {as if I had neuer beene such}.
3267  *<S {Ham}.> That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
3268  *once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
3269  *were {Caines} Iaw- bone, that did the first murther: It
3270  *might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Of-fices:
3271   one that could circumuent God, might it not?
3272   <S {Hor}.> It might, my Lord.
3273  *<S {Ham}.> Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Mor-row
3274  *sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
3275  *might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
3276  *a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
3277   <S {Hor}.> #I, my Lord.
3278  *<S {Ham}.> Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
3279  *Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
3280  *Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
3281  *see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
3282  *to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke
3283   on't.
3284   <S {Clowne sings}.>
3285   {A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade},
3286   {for #and a shrowding- Sheete}:
3287   {O a Pit of Clay for to be made},
3288   {for such a Guest is meete}.
3289  *<S {Ham}.> There's another: why might not that bee the
3290  *Scull  of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his
3291  *Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why
3292  *doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
3293  *the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
3294  *his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
3295  *time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recog-nizances,
3296  *his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
3297  *Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Reco-ueries,
3298  *to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his
3299  *Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and dou-ble
3300  *ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
3301  *Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
3302  *hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
3303   haue no more? ha?
3304   <S {Hor}.> Not a iot more, my Lord.
3305   <S {Ham}.> Is not Parchment made of Sheep- skinnes?
3306   <S {Hor}.> #I my Lord, and of Calue- skinnes too.
3307  *<S {Ham}.> They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assu-rance
3308  *in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
3309   this Sir?
3310   <S {Clo}.> Mine Sir:
3311   {O a Pit of Clay for to be made},
3312   {for such a Guest is meete}.
3313   <S {Ham}.> I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't.
3314  *<S {Clo}.> You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
3315   for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine.
3316  *<S {Ham}.> Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
3317  *'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
3318   lyest.
3319  *<S {Clo}.> 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
3320   to you.
3321   <S {Ham}.> What man dost thou digge it for?
3322   <S {Clo}.> For no man Sir.
3323   <S {Ham}.> What woman then?
3324   <S {Clo}.> For none neither.
3325   <S {Ham}.> Who is to be buried in't?
3326  *<S {Clo}.> One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,
3327   shee's dead.
3328  *<S {Ham}.> How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake
3329  *by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
3330  *Lord {Horatio}, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
3331  *the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
3332  *comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
3333   Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue- maker?
3334  *<S {Clo}.> Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
3335   that our last King {Hamlet} o'recame {Fortinbras}.
3336   <S {Ham}.> How long is that since?
3337  *<S {Clo}.> Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:
3338  *It was the very day, that young {Hamlet} was borne, hee
3339   that was mad, and sent into England.
3340   <S {Ham}.> #I marry, why was he sent into England?
3341  *<S {Clo}.> Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his
3342   wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there.
      <P pp5v>
3343   <S {Ham}.> Why?
3344  *<S {Clo}.> 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
3345   mad as he.
3346   <S {Ham}.> How came he mad?
3347   <S {Clo}.> Very strangely they say.
3348   <S {Ham}.> How strangely?
3349   <S {Clo}.> Faith e'ene with loosing his wits.
3350   <S {Ham}.> Vpon what ground?
3351  *<S {Clo}.> Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene
3352   heere, man and Boy thirty yeares.
3353  *<S {Ham}.> How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
3354  *<S {Clo}.> Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
3355  *many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
3356  *the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
3357   yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare.
3358   <S {Ham}.> Why he, more then another?
3359  *<S {Clo}.> Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
3360  *he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,
3361  *is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull
3362  *now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years.
3363   <S {Ham}.> Whose was it?
3364   <S {Clo}.> A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
3365   Whose doe you thinke it was?
3366   <S {Ham}.> Nay, I know not.
3367  *<S {Clo}.> A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, #a pour'd a
3368  *Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull
3369  *Sir, this same Scull sir, was {Yoricks} Scull, the Kings Iester.
3370   <S {Ham}.> This?
3371   <S {Clo}.> E'ene that.
3372  *<S {Ham}.> Let me see. Alas poore {Yorick}, I knew him {Ho-ratio},
3373  *a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
3374  *hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
3375  *abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere
3376  *hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
3377  *Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your
3378  *Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
3379  *set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own
3380  *Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies
3381  *Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
3382  *fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: pry-thee
3383   {Horatio} tell me one thing.
3384   <S {Hor}.> What's that my Lord?
3385  *<S {Ham}.> Dost thou thinke {Alexander} lookt o'this fa-shion
3386   i'th' earth?
3387   <S {Hor}.> E'ene so.
3388   <S {Ham}.> And smelt so? Puh.
3389   <S {Hor}.> E'ene so, my Lord.
3390  *<S {Ham}.> To what base vses we may returne {Horatio}.
3391  *Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of {A-lexander},
3392   till he find it stopping a bunghole.
3393  *<S {Hor}.> 'Twere to consider: #to curiously to consider so.
3394  *<S {Ham}.> No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
3395  *with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
3396  *{Alexander} died: {Alexander} was buried: {Alexander} re-turneth
3397  *into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
3398  *Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuer-ted)
3399   might they not stopp a Beere- barrell?
3400   Imperiall {Caesar}, dead and turn'd to clay,
3401   Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
3402   Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
3403   Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
3404   But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
3405   <D {Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin},
3406   {with Lords attendant}.>
3407   The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
3408   And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
3409   The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
3410   Fore do #it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
3411   Couch we #a while, and mark.
3412   <S {Laer}.> What Cerimony else?
3413   <S {Ham}.> That is {Laertes}, a very Noble youth: Marke.
3414   <S {Laer}.> What Cerimony else?
3415   <S {Priest}.> Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
3416   As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,
3417   And but that great Command, o're- swaies the order,
3418   She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
3419   Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
3420  *Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
3421   Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
3422   Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
3423   Of Bell and Buriall.
3424   <S {Laer}.> Must there no more be done ?
3425   <S {Priest}.> No more be done:
3426   We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
3427   To sing sage {Requiem}, and such rest to her
3428   As to peace- parted Soules.
3429   <S {Laer}.> Lay her i'th' earth,
3430   And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
3431   May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)
3432   A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
3433   When thou liest howling?
3434   <S {Ham}.> What, the faire {Ophelia}?
3435   <S {Queene}.> Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
3436   I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my {Hamlets} wife:
3437   I thought thy Bride- bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)
3438   And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue.
3439   <S {Laer}.> Oh terrible woer,
3440   Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
3441   Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
3442   Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth #a while,
3443   Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:
3444   <D {Leaps in the graue}.>
3445   Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
3446   Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
3447   To o're top old {Pelion}, or the skyish head
3448   Of blew {Olympus}.
3449   <S {Ham}.> What is he, whose griefes
3450   Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
3451   Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
3452   Like wonder- wounded hearers? This is I,
3453   {#Hamlet} the Dane.
3454   <S {Laer}.> The deuill take thy soule.
3455   <S {Ham}.> Thou prai'st not well,
3456   I prythee  take thy fingers from my throat;
3457   Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
3458   Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
3459   Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand.
3460   <S {King}.> Pluck them asunder.
3461   <S {Qu}.> {Hamlet}, {Hamlet}.
3462   <S {Gen}.> Good my Lord be quiet.
3463  *<S {Ham}.> Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
3464   Vntill my eielids will no longer wag.
3465   <S {Qu}.> Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
3466   <S {Ham}.> I lou'd {Ophelia}; fortie thousand Brothers
3467   Could not (with all #there quantitie of Loue)
3468   Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
3469   <S {King}.> Oh he is mad {Laertes},
3470   <S {Qu}.> For loue of God forbeare him.
3471   <S {Ham}.> Come show me what thou'lt doe.
3472   Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
3473   Woo't drinke vp {Esile}, eate a Crocodile?
      <P pp6><C S>
3474   Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
3475   To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
3476   Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
3477   And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
3478   Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
3479   Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
3480   Make {Ossa} like a wart. Nay, #and thou'lt mouth,
3481   Ile rant as well as thou.
3482   <S {Kin}.> This is meere Madnesse:
3483   And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
3484   Anon as patient as the female Doue,
3485   When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
3486   His silence will sit drooping.
3487   <S {Ham}.> Heare you Sir:
3488   What is the reason that you vse me thus?
3489   I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:
3490   Let {Hercules} himselfe doe what he may,
3491   The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.  <D {Exit}.>
3492   <S {Kin}.> I pray you good {Horatio} wait vpon him,
3493   Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,
3494   Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
3495   Good {Gertrude} set some watch ouer your Sonne,
3496   This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
3497   An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
3498   Till then, in patience our proceeding be.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3499   <D {Enter Hamlet and Horatio}.>
3500  *<S {Ham}.> So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
3501   You doe remember all the Circumstance.
3502   <S {Hor}.> Remember it my Lord?
3503   <S {Ham}.> Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
3504   That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
3505   Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
3506   (And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
3507   Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
3508  *When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
3509   There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
3510   Rough- hew them how we will.
3511   <S {Hor}.> That is most certaine.
3512   <S {Ham}.> Vp from my Cabin
3513   My sea- gowne scarft about me in the darke,
3514   Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
3515   Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
3516   To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
3517   (My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
3518   Their grand Commission, where I found {Horatio},
3519   Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
3520   Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
3521   Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
3522   With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
3523   That on the superuize no leasure bated,
3524   No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
3525   My head should be struck off.
3526   <S {Hor}.> Ist possible?
3527  *<S {Ham}.> Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
3528   But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
3529   <S {Hor}.> I beseech you.
3530   <S {Ham}.> Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
3531   Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
3532   They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
3533   Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
3534   I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
3535   A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
3536   How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
3537   It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know
3538   The effects of what I wrote?
3539   <S {Hor}.> #I, good my Lord.
3540   <S {Ham}.> An earnest Coniuration from the King,
3541   As England was his faithfull Tributary,
3542   As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
3543   As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
3544   And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
3545   And many such like Assis of great charge,
3546   That on the view and know of these Contents,
3547   Without debatement further, more or lesse,
3548   He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
3549   Not shriuing time allowed.
3550   <S {Hor}.> How was this seal'd?
3551   <S {Ham}.> Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
3552   I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
3553   Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
3554   Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
3555   Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
3556   The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
3557   Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
3558   Thou know'st already.
3559   <S {Hor}.> So {Guildensterne} and {Rosincrance}, go too't.
3560  *<S {Ham}.> Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
3561   They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
3562   Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
3563   'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
3564   Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
3565   Of mighty opposites.
3566   <S {Hor}.> Why, what a King is this?
3567   <S {Ham}.> Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
3568   He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
3569   Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
3570   Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
3571   And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
3572   To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
3573   To let this Canker of our nature come
3574   In further euill.
3575  *<S {Hor}.> It must be shortly knowne to him from England
3576   What is the issue of the businesse there.
3577   <S {Ham}.> It will be short,
3578   The {interim}'s mine, and a mans life's no more
3579   Then to say one: but I am very sorry good {Horatio},
3580   That to {Laertes} I forgot my selfe;
3581   For by the image of my Cause, I see
3582   The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
3583   But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
3584   Into a Towring passion.
3585   <S {Hor}.> Peace, who comes heere?
3586   <D {Enter young Osricke}.>
3587  *<S {Osr}.> Your Lordship is right welcome back to Den-|(marke.
3588  *<S {Ham}.> I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
3589   <S {Hor}.> No my good Lord.
3590  *<S {Ham}.> Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
3591  *know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
3592  *be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
3593  *Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the pos-session
3594   of dirt.
3595  *<S {Osr}.> Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,
3596   I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty.
3597  *<S {Ham}.> I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put
3598   your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head.
3599   <S {Osr}.> I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot.
3600  *<S {Ham}.> No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
3601   Northerly.
3602   <S {Osr}.> It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed.
3603  *<S {Ham}.> Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
3604   Complexion.
      <P pp6v><C B>
3605  *<S {Osr}.> Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
3606  *I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me sig-nifie
3607  *to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
3608   Sir, this is the matter.
3609   <S {Ham}.> I beseech you remember.
3610  *<S {Osr}.> Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
3611  *Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence {Laertes} is at
3612   his weapon.
3613   <S {Ham}.> What's his weapon?
3614   <S {Osr}.> Rapier and dagger.
3615   <S {Ham}.> That's two of his weapons; but well.
3616  *<S {Osr}.> The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary hor-ses,
3617  *against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
3618  *Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
3619  *Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
3620  *deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
3621   carriages, and of very liberall conceit.
3622   <S {Ham}.> What call you the Carriages?
3623   <S {Osr}.> The Carriages Sir, are the hangers.
3624  *<S {Ham}.> The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
3625  *matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
3626  *it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Hor-ses
3627  *against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
3628  *liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but a-gainst
3629   the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
3630  *<S {Osr}.> The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes be-tweene
3631  *you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
3632  *He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
3633  *imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
3634   Answere.
3635   <S {Ham}.> How if I answere no?
3636  *<S {Osr}.> I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
3637   in tryall.
3638  *<S {Ham}.> Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
3639  *his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
3640  *the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
3641  *King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
3642  *not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits.
3643   <S {Osr}.> Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
3644  *<S {Ham}.> To this effect Sir, after what flourish your na-ture
3645   will.
3646   <S {Osr}.> I commend my duty to your Lordship.
3647  *<S {Ham}.> Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it
3648   himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue.
3649  *<S {Hor}.> This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
3650   head.
3651  *<S {Ham}.> He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
3652  *suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
3653  *that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
3654  *the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
3655  *yesty collection, which carries them through & through
3656  *the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
3657   them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out.
3658   <S {Hor}.> You will lose this wager, my Lord.
3659  *<S {Ham}.> I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
3660  *I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
3661  *oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere a-bout
3662   my heart: but it is no matter.
3663   <S {Hor}.> Nay, good my Lord.
3664  *<S {Ham}.> It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of
3665   gain- giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman.
3666  *<S {Hor}.> If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will fore-stall
3667   their repaire hither, and say you are not fit.
3668  *<S {Ham}.> Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
3669  *Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
3670  *to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
3671  *be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
3672  *man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue be-times?
3673  _
3674  *<D {Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Atten-dants}
3675   {with Foyles, and Gauntlets, a Table and}
3676   {Flagons of Wine on it}.>
3677  *<S {Kin}.> Come {Hamlet}, come, and take this hand from me.
3678  *<S {Ham}.> Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
3679   But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
3680   This presence knowes,
3681   And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht
3682   With sore distraction? What I haue done
3683   That might your nature honour, and exception
3684   Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
3685   #Was't {Hamlet} wrong'd {Laertes}? Neuer {Hamlet}.
3686   If {Hamlet} from himselfe be tane away:
3687   And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong {Laertes},
3688   Then {Hamlet} does it not, {Hamlet} denies it:
3689   Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
3690   {#Hamlet} is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
3691   His madnesse is poore {Hamlets} Enemy.
3692   Sir, in this Audience,
3693   Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
3694   Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
3695   That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
3696   And hurt my Mother.
3697   <S {Laer}.> I am satisfied in Nature,
3698   Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
3699   To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
3700   I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
3701   Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
3702   I haue a voyce, and president of peace
3703   To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
3704   I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
3705   And wil not wrong it.
3706   <S {Ham}.> I do embrace it freely,
3707   And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
3708   Giue vs the Foyles: Come on.
3709   <S {Laer}.> Come one for me.
3710   <S {Ham}.> Ile be your foile {Laertes}, in mine ignorance,
3711   Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
3712   Sticke fiery off indeede.
3713   <S {Laer}.> You mocke me Sir.
3714   <S {Ham}.> No by this hand.
3715   <S {King}.> Giue them the Foyles yong {Osricke},
3716   Cousen {Hamlet}, you know the wager.
3717   <S {Ham}.> Verie well my Lord,
3718   Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side.
3719   <S {King}.> I do not feare it,
3720   I haue seene you both:
3721   But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes.
3722   <S {Laer}.> This is too heauy,
3723   Let me see another.
3724   <S {Ham}.> This likes me well,
3725   These Foyles haue all a length.  <D {Prepare to play}.>
3726   <S {Osricke}.> #I my good Lord.
3727   <S {King}.> Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
3728   If {Hamlet} giue the first, or second hit,
3729   Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
3730   Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
3731   The King shal drinke to {Hamlets} better breath,
3732   And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
3733   Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
3734   In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
      <P qq1>
3735   Giue me the Cups,
3736   And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
3737   The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
3738   The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
3739   Now the King drinkes to {Hamlet}. Come, begin,
3740   And you the Iudges  beare a wary eye.
3741   <S {Ham}.> Come on sir.
3742   <S {Laer}.> Come on sir.  <D {They play}.>
3743   <S {Ham}.> One.
3744   <S {Laer}.> No.
3745   <S {Ham}.> Iudgement.
3746   <S {Osr}.> A hit, a very palpable hit.
3747   <S {Laer}.> Well: againe.
3748   <S {King}.> Stay, giue me drinke.
3749   {Hamlet}, this Pearle is thine,
3750   Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,
3751   <D {Trumpets sound, and shot goes off}.>
3752   <S {Ham}.> Ile play this bout first, set by a- while.
3753   Come: Another hit; what say you?
3754   <S {Laer}.> A touch, a touch, I do confesse.
3755   <S {King}.> Our Sonne shall win.
3756   <S {Qu}.> He's fat, and scant of breath.
3757   Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
3758   The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, {Hamlet}.
3759   <S {Ham}.> Good Madam.
3760   <S {King}.> {Gertrude}, do not drinke.
3761   <S {Qu}.> I will my Lord;
3762   I pray you pardon me.
3763   <S {King}.> It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late.
3764   <S {Ham}.> I dare not drinke yet Madam,
3765   By and #by.
3766   <S {Qu}.> Come, let me wipe thy face.
3767   <S {Laer}.> My Lord, Ile hit him now.
3768   <S {King}.> I do not thinke't.
3769   <S {Laer}.> And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
3770   <S {Ham}.> Come for the third.
3771   {Laertes}, you but dally,
3772   I pray you passe with your best violence,
3773   I am affear'd you make a wanton of me.
3774   <S {Laer}.> Say you so? Come on.  <D {Play}.>
3775   <S {Osr}.> Nothing neither way.
3776   <S {Laer}.> Haue at you now.
3777   <D {In scuffling they change Rapiers}.>
3778   <S {King}.> Part them, they are incens'd.
3779   <S {Ham}.> Nay come, againe.
3780   <S {Osr}.> Looke to the Queene there hoa.
3781  *<S {Hor}.> They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?
3782   <S {Osr}.> How is't {Laertes}?
3783   <S {Laer}.> Why as a Woodcocke
3784   To mine Sprindge, {Osricke},
3785   I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie.
3786   <S {Ham}.> How does the Queene?
3787   <S {King}.> She sounds to see them bleede.
3788   <S {Qu}.> No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
3789   Oh my deere {Hamlet}, the drinke, the drinke,
3790   I am poyson'd.
3791   <S {Ham}.> Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
3792   Treacherie, seeke it out.
3793   <S {Laer}.> It is heere {Hamlet}.
3794   {#Hamlet}, thou art slaine,
3795   No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
3796   In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
3797   The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
3798   Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
3799   Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
3800   Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
3801   I can no more, the King, the King's #too blame.
3802   <S {Ham}.> The point envenom'd too,
3803   Then venome to thy worke.
3804   <D {Hurts the King}.>
3805   <S {All}.> Treason, Treason.
3806   <S {King}.> O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt.
3807   <S {Ham}.> Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,
3808   Damned Dane,
3809   Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
3810   Follow my Mother.  <D {King Dyes}.>
3811   <S {Laer}.> He is iustly seru'd.
3812   It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
3813   Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble {Hamlet};
3814   Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
3815   Nor thine on me.  <D {Dyes}.>
3816   <S {Ham}.> Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
3817   I am dead {Horatio}, wretched Queene adiew,
3818   You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
3819   That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
3820   Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
3821   Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
3822   But let it be: {Horatio}, I am dead,
3823   Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
3824   To the vnsatisfied.
3825   <S {Hor}.> Neuer beleeue it.
3826   I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
3827   Heere's yet some Liquor left.
3828   <S {Ham}.> As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
3829   Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
3830   Oh good {Horatio}, what a wounded name,
3831  *(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
3832   If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
3833   Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
3834   And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
3835   To tell my Storie.
3836   <D {March afarre off, and shout within}.>
3837   What warlike noyse is this?
3838   <D {Enter Osricke}.>
3839  *<S {Osr}.> Yong {Fortinbras}, with conquest come fro[m] Poland
3840  *To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly.
3841   <S {Ham}.> O I dye {Horatio}:
3842   The potent poyson quite ore- crowes my spirit,
3843   I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
3844   But I do prophesie th' election lights
3845   On {Fortinbras}, he ha's my dying voyce,
3846   So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
3847  *Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o. <D {Dyes}>
3848   <S {Hora}.> Now cracke a Noble heart:
3849   Goodnight sweet Prince,
3850   And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
3851   Why do's the Drumme come hither?
3852   <D {Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme},
3853   {Colours, and Attendants}.>
3854   <S {Fortin}.> Where is this sight?
3855   <S {Hor}.> What is it ye would see;
3856   If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search.
3857   <S {For}.> His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
3858   What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
3859   That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
3860   So bloodily hast strooke.
3861   <S {Amb}.> The sight is dismall,
3862   And our affaires from England come too late,
3863   The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
3864   To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
      <P qq1v>
3865   That {Rosincrance} and {Guildensterne} are dead:
3866   Where should we haue our thankes?
3867   <S {Hor}.> Not from his mouth,
3868   Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:
3869   He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
3870   But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
3871   You from the Polake warres, and you from England
3872   Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
3873   High on a stage be placed to the view,
3874   And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
3875   How these things came about. So shall you heare
3876   Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
3877   Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
3878   Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
3879   And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
3880   Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I
3881   Truly deliuer.
3882   <S {For}.> Let vs #hast to heare it,
3883   And call the Noblest to the Audience.
3884   For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
3885   I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
3886   Which are to claime, my vantage doth
3887   Inuite me,
3888   <S {Hor}.> Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
3889   And from his mouth
3890   Whose voyce will draw on more:
3891   But let this same be presently perform'd,
3892   Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
3893   Lest more mischance
3894   On plots, and errors happen.
3895   <S {For}.> Let foure Captaines
3896   Beare {Hamlet} like a Soldier to the Stage,
3897   For he was likely, had he beene put on
3898   To haue prou'd most royally:
3899   And for his passage,
3900   The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
3901   Speake lowdly for him.
3902   Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
3903   Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
3904   Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.
3905   <D {Exeunt Marching: after the which, a Peale of}
3906   {Ordenance are shot off}.>
