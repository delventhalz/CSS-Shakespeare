2      <D {Enter Sampson and Gregory, with Swords and Bucklers},
3      {of the House of Capulet}.>
4      <S {Sampson}.>
5      {Gregory}: #A my word wee'l not carry coales.
6      <S {Greg}.> No, for then we should be Colliars.
7     *<S {Samp}.> I mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw.
8     *<S {Greg}.> #I, While you liue, draw your necke out
9      o'th Collar.
10     <S {Samp}.> I strike quickly, being mou'd.
11     <S {Greg}.> But thou art not quickly mou'd to strike.
12     <S {Samp}.> A dog of the house of {Mountague}, moues me.
13    *<S {Greg}.> To moue, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand:
14     Therefore, if thou art mou'd, thou runst away.
15    *<S {Samp}.> A dogge of that house shall moue me to stand.
16     I will take the wall of any Man or Maid of {Mountagues}.
17    *<S {Greg}.> That shewes thee a weake slaue, for the wea-kest
18     goes to the wall.
19    *<S {Samp}.> True, and therefore women being the weaker
20    *Vessels, are euer thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
21    *{Mountagues} men from the wall, and thrust his Maides to
22     the wall.
23    *<S {Greg}.> The Quarrell is betweene our Masters, and vs |(their men.
24    *<S {Samp}.> 'Tis all one, I will shew my selfe a tyrant: when
25    *I haue fought with the men, I will bee ciuill with the
26     Maids, and cut off their heads.
27     <S {Greg}.> The heads of the Maids?
28    *<S {Sam}.> #I, the heads of the Maids, or their Maiden- heads,
29     Take it in what sence thou wilt.
30     <S {Greg}.> They must take #it sence, that feele it.
31     <S {Samp}.> Me they shall feele while I am able to stand:
32     And 'tis knowne I am a pretty peece of flesh.
33    *<S {Greg}.> 'Tis well thou art not Fish: If thou had'st, thou
34    *had'st beene poore Iohn. Draw thy Toole, here comes of
35     the House of the {Mountagues}.
36     <D {Enter two other Seruingmen}.>
37    *<S {Sam}.> My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I wil back thee
38     <S {Gre}.> How? Turne thy backe, and run.
39     <S {Sam}.> Feare me not.
40     <S {Gre}.> No marry: I feare thee.
41    *<S {Sam}.> Let vs take the Law of our sides: let them begin.
42    *<S {Gr}.> I wil frown as I passe by, & let the[m] take it as they list
43    *<S {Sam}.> Nay, as they dare. I wil bite my Thumb at them,
44     which is a disgrace to them, if they beare it.
45     <S {Abra}.> Do you bite your Thumbe at vs sir?
46     <S {Samp}.> I do bite my Thumbe, sir.
47     <S {Abra}.> Do you bite your Thumb at vs, sir?
48     <S {Sam}.> Is the Law of our side, if I say #I? <S {Gre}.> No.
49    *<S {Sam}.> No sir, I do not bite my Thumbe at you sir: but
50     I bite my Thumbe sir.
51     <S {Greg}.> Do you quarrell sir?
52     <S {Abra}.> Quarrell sir? no sir.
53    *<S {Sam}.> If you do sir, I am for you, I serue as good a man |(as you
54     <S {Abra}.> No better? <S {Samp}.> Well sir.
55     <D {Enter Benuolio}.>
56    *<S {Gr}.> Say better: here comes one of my masters kinsmen.
57     <S {Samp}.> Yes, better.
58     <S {Abra}.> You Lye.
59    *<S {Samp}.> Draw if you be men. {Gregory}, remember thy
60     washing blow. <D {They Fight}.>
61    *<S {Ben}.> Part Fooles, put vp your Swords, you know not
62     what you do.
63     <D {Enter Tibalt}.>
64    *<S {Tyb}.> What art thou drawne, among these heartlesse
65     Hindes? Turne thee {Benuolio}, looke vpon thy death.
66     <S {Ben}.> I do but keepe the peace, put vp thy Sword,
67     Or manage it to part these men with me.
68    *<S {Tyb}.> What draw, and talke of peace? I hate the word
69     As I hate #hell, all {Mountagues}, and thee:
70     Haue at thee Coward. <D {Fight}.>
71     <D {Enter three or foure Citizens with Clubs}.>
72    *<S {Offi}.> Clubs, Bils, and Partisons, strike, beat them down
73     Downe with the {Capulets}, downe with the {Mountagues}.
74     <D {Enter old Capulet in his Gowne, and his wife}.>
75    *<S {Cap}.> What noise is this? Giue me my long Sword ho.
76    *<S {Wife}.> A crutch, a crutch: why call you for a Sword?
77     <S {Cap}.> My Sword I say: Old {Mountague} is come,
78     And flourishes his Blade in spight of me.
79     <D {Enter old Mountague, & his wife}.>
80    *<S {Moun}.> Thou villaine {Capulet}. Hold me not, let me go
81     <S 2.{Wife}.> Thou shalt not stir #a foote to seeke a Foe.
82     <D {Enter Prince Eskales, with his Traine}.>
83     <S {Prince}.> Rebellious Subiects, Enemies to peace,
84     Prophaners of this Neighbor- stained Steele,
85     Will they not heare? What hoe, you Men, you Beasts,
86     That quench the fire of your pernitious Rage,
87     With purple Fountaines issuing from your Veines:
88     On paine of Torture, from those bloody hands
89     Throw your mistemper'd Weapons to the ground,
90     And heare the Sentence of your mooued Prince.
91     Three ciuill Broyles, bred of an Ayery word,
92     By thee old {Capulet} and {Mountague},
93     Haue thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
94     And made {Verona's} ancient Citizens
95     Cast by their Graue beseeming Ornaments,
96     To wield old Partizans, in hands as old,
      <P ee3v><C E>
97     Cankred with peace, to part your Cankred hate,
98     If euer you disturbe our streets againe,
99     Your liues shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
100    For this time all the rest depart away:
101    You {Capulet} shall goe along with me,
102    And {Mountague} come you this afternoone,
103    To know our Fathers pleasure in this case:
104    To old Free- towne, our common iudgement place:
105    Once more on paine of death, all men depart. <D {Exeunt}.>
106   *<S {Moun}.> Who set this auncient quarrell new abroach?
107    Speake Nephew, were you by, when it began:
108    <S {Ben}.> Heere were the seruants of your aduersarie,
109    And yours close fighting ere I did approach,
110    I drew to part them, in the instant came
111    The fiery {Tibalt}, with his sword prepar'd,
112    Which as he breath'd defiance to my eares,
113    He swong about his head, and cut the windes,
114    Who nothing hurt withall, hist him in scorne.
115    While we were enterchanging thrusts and blowes,
116    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
117    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
118    <S {Wife}.> O where is {Romeo}, saw you him to day?
119    Right glad am I, he was not at this fray.
120    <S {Ben}.> Madam, an houre before the worshipt Sun
121    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
122    A troubled mind draue me to walke abroad,
123    Where vnderneath the groue of Sycamour,
124    That West- ward rooteth from this City side:
125    So earely walking did I see your Sonne:
126    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
127    And stole into the couert of the wood,
128    I measuring his affections by my owne,
129   *Which then most sought, wher most might not be found:
130    Being one too many by my weary selfe,
131    Pursued my Honour, not pursuing his
132    And gladly shunn'd, who gladly fled from me.
133    <S {Mount}.> Many a morning hath he there beene seene,
134    With teares augmenting the fresh mornings deaw,
135    Adding to cloudes, more cloudes with his deepe sighes,
136    But all so soone as the all- cheering Sunne,
137    Should in the farthest East begin to draw
138    The shadie Curtaines from {Auroras} bed,
139    Away from light steales home my heauy Sonne,
140    And priuate in his Chamber pennes himselfe,
141    Shuts vp his windowes, lockes faire day- light out,
142    And makes himselfe an artificiall night:
143    Blacke and portendous must this humour proue,
144    Vnlesse good counsell may the cause remoue.
145    <S {Ben}.> My Noble Vncle doe you know the cause?
146    <S {Moun}.> I neither know it, nor can learne of him.
147    <S {Ben}.> Haue you importun'd him by any meanes?
148    <S {Moun}.> Both by my selfe and many other Friends,
149    But he his owne affections counseller,
150    Is to himselfe (I will not say how true)
151    But to himselfe so secret and so close,
152    So farre from sounding and discouery,
153    As is the bud bit with an enuious worme,
154    Ere he can spread his sweete leaues to the ayre,
155    Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
156    Could we but learne from whence his sorrowes grow,
157    We would as willingly giue cure, as know.
158    <D {Enter Romeo}.>
159    <S {Ben}.> See where he comes, so please you step aside,
160    Ile know his greeuance, or be much denide.
161    <S {Moun}.> I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
162    To heare true shrift. Come Madam let's away. <D {Exeunt}.>
163    <S {Ben}.> Good morrow Cousin.
164    <S {Rom}.> Is the day so young?
165    <S {Ben}.> But new strooke nine.
166    <S {Rom}.> Aye me, sad houres seeme long:
167    Was that my Father that went hence so fast?
168    <S {Ben}.> It was: what sadnes lengthens {Romeo's} houres?
169   *<S {Ro}.> Not hauing that, which hauing, makes them short
170    <S {Ben}.> In loue.
171    <S {Romeo}.> Out.
172    <S {Ben}.> Of loue.
173    <S {Rom}.> Out of her fauour where I am in loue.
174    <S {Ben}.> Alas that loue so gentle in his view,
175    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proofe.
176    <S {Rom}.> Alas that loue, whose view is muffled still,
177    Should without eyes, see path- wayes to his #will:
178    Where shall we dine? O me: what fray was heere?
179    Yet tell me not, for I haue heard it all:
180    Heere's much to do with hate, but more with loue:
181    Why then, O brawling loue, O louing hate,
182    O any thing, of nothing first created:
183    O heauie lightnesse, serious vanity,
184    Mishapen Chaos of welseeming formes,
185    Feather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health,
186    Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is:
187    This loue feele I, that feele no loue in this.
188    Doest thou not laugh?
189    <S {Ben}.> No Coze, I rather weepe.
190    <S {Rom}.> Good heart, at what?
191    <S {Ben}.> At thy good hearts oppression.
192    <S {Rom}.> Why such is loues transgression.
193    Griefes of mine owne lie heauie in my breast,
194    Which thou wilt propagate to haue it preast
195    With more of thine, this loue that thou hast showne,
196    Doth adde more griefe, to too much of mine owne.
197    Loue, is a smoake made with the fume of sighes,
198    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in Louers eyes,
199    Being vext, a Sea nourisht with louing teares,
200    What is it else? a madnesse, most discreet,
201    A choking gall, and a preseruing sweet:
202    Farewell my Coze.
203    <S {Ben}.> Soft I will goe along.
204    #And if you leaue me so, you do me wrong.
205    <S {Rom}.> Tut I haue lost my selfe, I am not here,
206    This is not {Romeo}, hee's some other where.
207    <S {Ben}.> Tell me in sadnesse, who is  that you loue?
208    <S {Rom}.> What shall I grone and tell thee?
209    <S {Ben}.> Grone, why no: but sadly tell me who.
210    <S {Rom}.> A sicke man in sadnesse makes his #will:
211    A word #ill vrg'd to one that is so #ill:
212    In sadnesse Cozin, I do loue a woman.
213    <S {Ben}.> I aym'd so neare, when I suppos'd you lou'd.
214   *<S {Rom}.> A right good marke man, and shee's faire I loue
215    <S {Ben}.> A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit.
216    <S {Rom}.> Well in that hit you misse, sheel not be hit
217    With Cupids arrow, she hath {Dians} wit:
218    And in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd:
219    From loues weake childish Bow, she liues vncharm'd.
220    Shee will not stay the siege of louing tearmes,
221    Nor bid th' encounter of assailing eyes.
222    Nor open her lap to Sainct- seducing Gold:
223    O she is rich in beautie, onely poore,
224    That when she dies, with beautie dies her store.
225   *<S {Ben}.> Then she hath sworne, that she will still liue chast?
226    <S {Rom}.> She hath, and in that sparing make huge #wast?
227    For beauty steru'd with her seuerity,
228    Cuts beauty off from all posteritie.
      <P ee4>
229    She is too faire, too wise: wisely too faire,
230    To merit blisse by making me dispaire:
231    She hath forsworne to loue, and in that vow
232    Do I liue dead, that liue to tell it now.
233    <S {Ben}.> Be rul'd by me, forget to thinke of her.
234    <S {Rom}.> O teach me how I should forget to thinke.
235    <S {Ben}.> By giuing liberty vnto thine eyes,
236    Examine other beauties,
237   *<S {Ro}.> 'Tis the way to cal hers (exquisit) in question more,
238    These happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes,
239    Being blacke, puts vs in mind they hide the faire:
240    He that is strooken blind, cannot forget
241    The precious treasure of his eye- sight lost:
242    Shew me a Mistresse that is passing faire,
243    What doth her beauty serue but as a note,
244    Where I may read who past that passing faire.
245    Farewell thou can'st not teach me to forget,
246    <S {Ben}.> Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. <D {Exeunt}>
247    <D {Enter Capulet, Countie Paris, and the Clowne}.>
248    <S {Capu}.> {Mountague} is bound as well as I,
249    In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke,
250    For men so old as wee, to keepe the peace.
251    <S {Par}.> Of Honourable reckoning are you both,
252    And pittie 'tis you liu'd at ods so long:
253    But now my Lord, what say you to my sute?
254    <S {Capu}.> But saying ore what I haue said before,
255    My Child is yet a stranger in the world,
256    Shee hath not seene the change of fourteene yeares,
257    Let two more Summers wither in their pride,
258    Ere we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride.
259    <S {Pari}.> Younger then she, are happy mothers made.
260    <S {Capu}.> And too soone mar'd are those so early made:
261    Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
262    Shee's the hopefull Lady of my earth:
263    But wooe her gentle {Paris}, get her heart,
264    My #will to her consent, is but a part,
265    #And shee agree, within her scope of choise,
266    Lyes my consent, and faire according voice:
267    This night I hold an old accustom'd Feast,
268    Whereto I haue inuited many a Guest,
269    Such as I loue, and you among the store,
270    One more, most welcome makes my number more:
271    At my poore house, looke to behold this night,
272    Earth- treading starres, that make darke heauen light,
273    Such comfort as do lusty young men feele,
274    When well apparrel'd Aprill on the #heele
275    Of limping Winter treads, euen such delight
276    Among fresh Fennell buds shall you this night
277    Inherit at my house: heare all, all see:
278    And like her most, whose merit most shall be:
279    Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one,
280    May stand in number, though in reckning none.
281    Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about,
282    Through faire {Verona}, find those persons out,
283    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
284    My house and welcome, on their pleasure stay. <D {Exit}.>
285   *<S {Ser}.> Find them out whose names are written. Heere it
286   *is written, that the Shoo- maker should meddle with his
287   *Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his
288   *Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets. But I am sent to
289   *find those persons whose names are writ, & can neuer find
290   *what names the writing person hath here writ (I must to
291    the learned) in good time.
292    <D {Enter Benuolio, and Romeo}.>
293    <S {Ben}.> Tut man, one fire burnes out anothers burning,
294    One paine is lesned by anothers anguish:
295    Turne giddie, and be holpe by backward turning:
296    One desparate greefe, cures with anothers languish:
297    Take thou some new infection to the eye,
298    And the rank poyson of the old wil die.
299    <S {Rom}.> Your Plantan leafe is excellent for that.
300    <S {Ben}.> For what I pray thee?
301    <S {Rom}.> For your broken shin.
302    <S {Ben}.> Why {Romeo} art thou mad?
303    <S {Rom}.> Not mad, but bound more then a mad man is:
304    Shut vp in prison, kept without my foode,
305    Whipt and tormented: and Godden good fellow,
306    <S {Ser}.> Godgigoden, I pray sir can you read?
307    <S {Rom}.> #I mine owne fortune in my miserie.
308    <S {Ser}.> Perhaps you haue learn'd it without booke:
309    But I pray can you read any thing you see?
310    <S {Rom}.> #I, if I know the Letters and the Language.
311    <S {Ser}.> Ye say honestly, rest you merry.
312    <S {Rom}.> Stay fellow, I can read.
313    <D He reades the Letter.>
314   *{Seigneur Martino, and his wife and daughter: County An-selme}
315   *{and his beautious sisters: the Lady widdow of Vtru-uio},
316   *{Seigneur Placentio, and his louely Neeces: Mercutio and}
317   *{his brother Valentine: mine vncle Capulet his wife and daugh-ters}:
318   *{my faire Neece Rosaline, Liuia, Seigneur Valentio, & his}
319    {Cosen Tybalt: Lucio and the liuely Helena}.
320    A faire assembly, whither should they come?
321    <S {Ser}.> Vp.
322    <S {Rom}.> Whither? to supper?
323    <S {Ser}.> To our house.
324    <S {Rom}.> Whose house?
325    <S {Ser}.> My Maisters.
326    <S {Rom}.> Indeed I should haue askt you that before.
327   *<S {Ser}.> Now Ile tell you without asking. My maister is
328   *the great rich {Capulet}, and if you be not of the house of
329   *{Mountagues} I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest
330    you merry. <D {Exit}.>
331    <S {Ben}.> At this same auncient Feast of {Capulets}
332    Sups the faire {Rosaline}, whom thou so loues:
333    With all the admired Beauties of {Verona},
334    Go thither and with vnattainted eye,
335    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
336    And I will make thee thinke thy Swan a Crow.
337    <S {Rom}.> When the deuout religion of mine eye
338    Maintaines such falshood, then turne teares to fire:
339    And these who often drown'd could neuer die,
340    Transparent Heretiques be burnt for liers.
341    One fairer then my loue: the all- seeing Sun
342    Nere saw her match, since first the world begun.
343    <S {Ben}.> Tut, you saw her faire, none else being by,
344    Herselfe poys'd with herselfe in either eye:
345    But in that Christall scales, let there be waid,
346    Your Ladies loue against some other Maid
347    That I will show you, shining at this Feast,
348    #And she shew scant #shell, well, that now shewes best.
349    <S {Rom}.> Ile goe along, no such sight to be showne,
350    But to reioyce in splendor of mine owne.
351    <D {Enter Capulets Wife and Nurse}.>
352   *<S {Wife}.> Nurse wher's my daughter? call her forth to me.
353   *<S {Nurse}.> Now by my Maidenhead, at twelue yeare old
354   *I bad her come, what Lamb: what Ladi- bird, God forbid,
355    Where's this Girle? what {Iuliet}?
356    <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
357    <S {Iuliet}.> How now, who calls?
358    <S {Nur}.> Your Mother.
359    <S {Iuliet}.> Madam I am heere, what is your #will?
360   *<S {Wife}.> This is the matter: Nurse giue me leaue awhile, we
      <P ee4v>
361   *must talke in secret. Nurse come backe againe, I haue re-membred
362   *me, thou'se heare our counsell. Thou knowest
363    my daughter's of a prety age.
364    <S {Nurse}.> Faith I can tell her age vnto an houre.
365    <S {Wife}.> Shee's not fourteene.
366    <S {Nurse}.> Ile lay fourteene of my teeth,
367    And yet to my teene be it spoken,
368    I haue but foure, shee's not fourteene.
369    How long is it now to {Lammas} tide?
370    <S {Wife}.> A fortnight and odde dayes.
371   *<S {Nurse}.> Euen or odde, of all daies in the yeare come
372   *{Lammas} Eue at night shall she be fourteene. {Susan} & she,
373   *God rest all Christian soules, were of an age. Well {Susan}
374   *is with God, she was too good for me. But as I said, on {La-mas}
375   *Eue at night shall she be fourteene, that shall she ma-rie,
376   *I remember it well. 'Tis since the Earth- quake now
377   *eleuen yeares, and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it,
378   *of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then
379   *laid Worme- wood to my Dug sitting in the Sunne vnder
380   *the Douehouse wall, my Lord and you were  then at
381   *{Mantua}, nay I doe beare a braine. But as I said, when it
382   *did tast the Worme- wood  on the nipple of my Dugge,
383   *and felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall out
384   *with the Dugge, Shake quoth the Doue- house, 'twas no
385   *neede I trow to bid mee trudge, and since that time it is
386   *a eleuen yeares, for then she could stand alone, nay bi'th'
387   *roode she could haue runne, & wadled all about: for euen
388   *the day before she broke her brow, & then my Husband
389   *God be with his soule, #a was a merrie man, tooke vp the
390   *Child, yea quoth hee, doest thou fall vpon thy face? thou
391   *wilt fall backeward when thou hast more wit, wilt thou
392   *not {Iule}? And by my holy- dam, the pretty wretch lefte
393   *crying, & said #I: to see now how a Iest shall come about.
394   *I warrant, #& I shall liue a thousand yeares, I neuer should
395   *forget it: wilt thou not {Iule}  quoth he? and pretty foole it
396    stinted, and said #I.
397    <S {Old} {La}.> Inough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace.
398   *<S {Nurse}.> Yes Madam, yet I cannot chuse but laugh, to
399   *thinke it should leaue crying, & say #I: and yet I warrant
400   *it had vpon #it brow, a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels
401   *stone? A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly. Yea quoth
402   *my husband, fall'st vpon thy face, thou wilt fall back-ward
403   *when thou commest to age: wilt thou not {Iule}? It
404    stinted: and said #I.
405    <S {Iule}.> And stint thou too, I pray thee {Nurse}, say I.
406   *<S {Nur}.> Peace I haue done: God marke thee #too his grace
407   *thou wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nurst, #and I might
408    liue to see thee married once, I haue my wish.
409    <S {Old} {La}.> Marry that marry is the very theame
410    I came to talke of, tell me daughter {Iuliet},
411    How stands your disposition to be Married?
412    <S {Iuli}.> It is an houre that I dreame not of.
413   *<S {Nur}.> An houre, were I not thine onely Nurse, I would
414    say thou had'st suckt wisedome from thy teat.
415   *<S {Old} {La}.> Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then you
416    Heere in {Verona}, Ladies of esteeme,
417    Are made already Mothers. By my count
418    I was your Mother, much vpon these yeares
419    That you are now a Maide, thus then in briefe:
420    The valiant {Paris} seekes you for his loue.
421   *<S {Nurse}.> A man young Lady, Lady, such a man as all
422    the world. Why hee's a man of waxe.
423    <S {Old} {La}.> {Veronas} Summer hath not such a flower.
424    <S {Nurse}.> Nay hee's a flower, infaith a very flower.
425    <S {Old} {La}.> What say you, can you loue the Gentleman?
426    This night you shall behold him at our Feast,
427    Read ore the volume of young {Paris} face,
428    And find delight, writ there with Beauties pen:
429    Examine euery seuerall liniament,
430    And see how one another lends content:
431    And what obscur'd in this faire volume lies,
432    Find written in the Margent of his eyes.
433    This precious Booke of Loue, this vnbound Louer,
434    To Beautifie him, onely lacks a Couer.
435    The fish liues in the Sea, and 'tis much pride
436    For faire without, the faire within to hide:
437    That Booke in manies eyes doth share the glorie,
438    That in Gold claspes, Lockes in the Golden storie:
439    So shall you share all that he doth possesse,
440    By hauing him, making your selfe no lesse.
441    <S {Nurse}.> No lesse, nay bigger: women grow by men.
442    <S {Old} {La}.> Speake briefly, can you like of {Paris} loue?
443    <S {Iuli}.> Ile looke to like, if looking liking moue.
444    But no more deepe will I endart mine eye,
445    Then your consent giues strength to make flye.
446    <D {Enter a Seruing man}.>
447   *<S {Ser}.> Madam, the guests are come, supper seru'd vp, you
448   *cal'd, my young Lady askt for, the Nurse cur'st in the Pan-tery,
449   *and euery thing in extremitie: I must hence to wait, I
450    beseech you follow straight. <D {Exit}.>
451    <S {Mo}.> We follow thee, {Iuliet}, the Countie staies.
452   *<S {Nurse}.> Goe Gyrle, seeke happie nights to happy daies.
453    <D {Exeunt}.>
454    <D {Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benuolio, with fiue or  sixe}
455    {other Maskers, Torch- bearers}.>
456   *<S {Rom}.> What shall this spech be spoke for our excuse?
457    Or shall we on without Apologie?
458    <S {Ben}.> The date is out of such prolixitie,
459    Weele haue no {Cupid}, hood winkt with a skarfe,
460    Bearing a Tartars painted Bow of lath,
461    Skaring the Ladies like a Crow- keeper.
462    But let them measure vs by what they will,
463    Weele measure them with a Measure, and be gone.
464    <S {Rom}.> Giue me a Torch, I am not for this ambling.
465    Being but heauy I will beare the light.
466    <S {Mer}.> Nay gentle {Romeo}, we must haue you dance.
467    <S {Rom}.> Not I beleeue me, you haue dancing shooes
468    With nimble soles, I haue a soale of Lead
469    So stakes me to the ground, I cannot moue.
470    <S {Mer}.> You are a Louer, borrow {Cupids} wings,
471    And soare with them aboue a common bound.
472    <S {Rom}.> I am too sore enpearced with his shaft,
473    To soare with his light feathers, and to bound:
474    I cannot bound a pitch aboue dull woe,
475    Vnder loues heauy burthen doe I sinke.
476    <S {Hora}.> And to sinke in it should you burthen loue,
477    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
478    <S {Rom}.> Is loue a tender thing? it is too rough,
479    Too rude, too boysterous, and it pricks like thorne.
480   *<S {Mer}.> If loue be rough with you, be rough with loue,
481    Pricke loue for pricking, and you beat loue downe,
482    Giue me a Case to put my visage in,
483    A Visor for a Visor, what care I
484    What curious eye doth quote deformities:
485    Here are the Beetle- browes shall blush for me.
486    <S {Ben}.> Come knocke and enter, and no sooner in,
487    But euery man betake him to his legs.
488    <S {Rom}.> A Torch for me, let wantons light of heart
489    Tickle the sencelesse rushes with their heeles:
490    For I am prouerb'd with a Grandsier Phrase,
491    Ile be a Candle- holder and looke on,
492    The game was nere so faire, and I am done.
      <P ee5>
493   *<S {Mer}.> Tut, duns the Mouse, the Constables owne word,
494    If thou art dun, weele draw thee from the mire.
495    Or saue your reuerence loue, wherein thou stickest
496    Vp to the eares, come we burne day- light ho.
497    <S {Rom}.> Nay that's not so.
498    <S {Mer}.> I meane sir I delay,
499    We #wast our lights in vaine, lights, lights, by day;
500    Take our good meaning, for our Iudgement sits
501    Fiue times in that, ere once in our fiue wits.
502    <S {Rom}.> And we meane well in going to this Maske,
503    But 'tis no wit to go.
504    <S {Mer}.> Why may one aske?
505    <S {Rom}.> I dreampt a dreame to night.
506    <S {Mer}.> And so did I.
507    <S {Rom}.> Well what was yours?
508    <S {Mer}.> That dreamers often lye.
509   *<S {Ro}.> In bed #a sleepe while they do dreame things true.
510   *<S {Mer}.> O then I see Queene Mab hath beene with you:
511   *She is the Fairies Midwife, & she comes in shape no big-ger
512   *then Agat- stone, on the fore- finger of an Alderman,
513   *drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens noses as
514   *they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spin-ners
515   *legs: the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers, her
516   *Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her coullers of the
517   *Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,
518   *the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray- coated
519   *Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme, prickt
520   *from the Lazie- finger of a man. Her Chariot is an emptie
521   *Haselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time
522   *out #a mind, the Faries Coach- makers: & in this state she
523   *gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then
524   *they dreame of Loue. On Courtiers knees, that dreame on
525   *Cursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on
526   *Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which
527   *oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their
528   *breath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime she gal-lops
529   *ore a Courtiers nose, & then dreames he of smelling
530   *out a sute: & somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tick-ling
531   *a Parsons nose as #a lies asleepe, then he dreames of
532   *another Benefice. Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers
533   *necke, & then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of
534   *Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue
535   *Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which
536   *he startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a
537   *prayer or two & sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that
538   *plats the manes of Horses in the night: & bakes the Elk-locks
539   *in foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much
540    misfortune bodes,
541    This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
542    That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
543    Making them women of good carriage:
544    This is she.
545    <S {Rom}.> Peace, peace, {Mercutio} peace,
546    Thou talk'st of nothing.
547    <S {Mer}.> True, I  talke of dreames:
548    Which are the children of an idle braine,
549    Begot of nothing, but vaine phantasie,
550    Which is as thin of substance as the ayre,
551    And more inconstant then the wind, who wooes
552    Euen now the frozen bosome of the North:
553    And being anger'd, puffes away from thence,
554    Turning his side to the dew dropping South.
555   *<S {Ben}.> This wind you talke of blowes vs from our selues,
556    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
557    <S {Rom}.> I feare too early, for my mind misgiues,
558    Some consequence yet hanging in the starres,
559    Shall bitterly begin his fearefull date
560    With this nights reuels, and expire the tearme
561    Of a despised life clos'd in my brest:
562    By some vile forfeit of vntimely death.
563    But he that hath the stirrage of my course,
564    Direct my sute: on lustie Gentlemen.
565    <S {Ben}.> Strike  Drum.
566   *<D {They march about the Stage, and Seruingmen come forth}
567    {with their napkins}.>
568    <D {Enter Seruant}.>
569   *<S {Ser}.> Where's {Potpan}, that he helpes not to take away?
570    He shift a Trencher? he scrape a Trencher?
571   *<S 1.> When good manners, shall lie in one or two mens
572    hands, and they vnwasht too, 'tis a foule thing.
573   *<S {Ser}.> Away with the Ioynstooles, remoue the Court-cubbord,
574   *looke to the Plate: good thou, saue mee a piece
575   *of Marchpane, and as thou louest me, let the Porter let in
576    {Susan Grindstone}, and {Nell}, {Anthonie} and {Potpan}.
577    <S 2.> #I Boy readie.
578   *<S {Ser}.> You are lookt for, and cal'd for, askt for, & sought
579    for, in the great Chamber.
580    <S 1.> We cannot be here and there too, chearly Boyes,
581    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liuer take all.
582    <D {Exeunt}.>
583    <D {Enter all the Guests and Gentlewomen to the}
584    {Maskers}.>
585    <S 1. {Capu}.> Welcome Gentlemen,
586    Ladies that haue their toes
587    Vnplagu'd with Cornes, will walke about with you:
588    Ah my Mistresses, which of you all
589    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
590    She Ile sweare hath Cornes: am I come neare ye now?
591    Welcome Gentlemen, I haue seene the day
592    That I haue worne a Visor, and could tell
593    A whispering tale in a faire Ladies eare:
594    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone,
595    You are welcome Gentlemen, come Musitians play:
596    <D {Musicke plaies: and they dance}.>
597    A Hall, Hall, giue roome, and foote it Girles,
598    More light you knaues, and turne the Tables vp:
599    And quench the fire, the Roome is growne too hot.
600    Ah sirrah, this vnlookt for sport comes well:
601    Nay sit, nay sit, good Cozin {Capulet},
602    For you and I are past our dauncing daies:
603    How long 'ist now since last your selfe and I
604    Were in a Maske?
605    <S 2. {Capu}.> Berlady thirty yeares.
606   *<S 1. {Capu}.> What man: 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much,
607    'Tis since the Nuptiall of {Lucentio},
608    Come Pentycost as quickely as it will,
609    Some fiue and twenty yeares, and then we Maskt.
610    <S 2. {Cap}.> 'Tis more, 'tis more, his Sonne is elder sir:
611    His Sonne is thirty.
612    <S 3. {Cap}.> Will you tell me that?
613    His Sonne was but a Ward two yeares agoe.
614   *<S {Rom}.> What Ladie is that which doth inrich the hand
615    Of yonder Knight?
616    <S {Ser}.> I know not sir.
617   *<S {Rom}.> O she doth teach the Torches to burne bright:
618    It seemes she hangs vpon the cheeke of night,
619    As a rich Iewel in an Aethiops eare:
620    Beauty too rich for vse, for earth too deare:
621    So shewes a Snowy Doue trooping with Crowes,
622    As yonder Lady ore her fellowes showes;
623    The measure done, Ile watch her place of stand,
624    And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
      <P ee5v>
625    Did my heart loue till now, forsweare it sight,
626    For I neuer saw true Beauty till this night.
627    <S {Tib}.> This by his voice, should be a {Mountague}.
628    Fetch me my Rapier Boy, what dares the slaue
629    Come hither couer'd with an antique face,
630    To fleere and scorne at our Solemnitie?
631    Now by the stocke and Honour of my kin,
632    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
633    <S {Cap}.> Why how now kinsman,
634    Wherefore storme you so?
635    <S {Tib}.> Vncle this is a {Mountague}, our foe:
636    A Villaine that is hither come in spight,
637    To scorne at our Solemnitie this night.
638    <S {Cap}.> Young {Romeo} is it?
639    <S {Tib}.> 'Tis he, that Villaine {Romeo}.
640    <S {Cap}.> Content thee gentle Coz, let him alone,
641    #A beares him like a portly Gentleman:
642    And to say truth, {Verona} brags of him,
643    To be a vertuous and well gouern'd youth:
644    I would not for the wealth of all the towne,
645    Here in my house do him disparagement:
646    Therfore be patient, take no note of him,
647    It is my #will, the which if thou respect,
648    Shew a faire presence, and put off these frownes,
649    An #ill beseeming semblance for a Feast
650    <S {Tib}.> It fits when such a Villaine is a guest,
651    Ile not endure him.
652    <S {Cap}.> He shall be endur'd.
653    What goodman boy, I say he  shall, go #too,
654    Am I the Maister here or you? go #too,
655    Youle not endure him, God shall mend my soule,
656    Youle make a Mutinie among the Guests:
657    You will set cocke #a hoope, youle be the man.
658    <S {Tib}.> Why Vncle, 'tis a shame.
659    <S {Cap}.> Go #too, go #too,
660    You are a sawcy Boy, 'ist so indeed?
661    This tricke may chance to scath you, I know what,
662    You must contrary me, marry 'tis time.
663    Well said my hearts, you are a Princox, goe,
664    Be quiet, or more light, more light for shame,
665    Ile make you quiet. What, chearely my hearts.
666    <S {Tib}.> Patience perforce, with wilfull choler meeting,
667    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting:
668    I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall
669    Now seeming sweet, conuert to bitter gall. <D {Exit}.>
670    <S {Rom}.> If I prophane with my vnworthiest hand,
671    This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
672    My lips to blushing Pilgrims did ready stand,
673    To smooth that rough touch, with a tender kisse.
674    <S {Iul}.> Good Pilgrime,
675    You do wrong your hand too much.
676    Which mannerly deuotion shewes in this,
677    For Saints haue hands, that Pilgrims hands do tuch,
678    And palme to palme, is holy Palmers kisse.
679    <S {Rom}.> Haue not Saints lips, and holy Palmers too?
680    <S {Iul}.> #I Pilgrim, lips that they must vse in prayer.
681    <S {Rom}.> O then deare Saint, let lips do what hands do,
682    They pray (grant thou) least faith turne to dispaire.
683    <S {Iul}.> Saints do not moue,
684    Though grant for prayers sake.
685   *<S {Rom}.> Then moue not while my prayers effect I take:
686    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
687    <S {Iul}.> Then haue my lips the sin that they haue tooke.
688    <S {Rom}.> Sin from my lips? O trespasse sweetly vrg'd:
689    Giue me my sin againe.
690    <S {Iul}.> You kisse by'th' booke.
691    <S {Nur}.> Madam your Mother craues a word with you.
692    <S {Rom}.> What is her Mother?
693    <S {Nurs}.> Marrie Batcheler,
694    Her Mother is the Lady of the house,
695    And a good Lady, and a wise, and Vertuous,
696    I Nur'st her Daughter that you talkt withall:
697    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her,
698    Shall haue the chincks.
699    <S {Rom}.> Is she a {Capulet}?
700    O deare account! My life is my foes debt.
701    <S {Ben}.> Away, be gone, the sport is at the best.
702    <S {Rom}.> #I so I feare, the more is my vnrest.
703    <S {Cap}.> Nay Gentlemen prepare not to be gone,
704    We haue a trifling foolish Banquet towards:
705    Is it e'ne so? why then I thanke you all.
706    I thanke you honest Gentlemen, good night:
707    More Torches here: come on, then let's to bed.
708    Ah sirrah, by my faie it waxes late,
709    Ile to my rest.
710    <S {Iuli}.> Come hither Nurse,
711    What is yond Gentleman:
712    <S {Nur}.> The Sonne and Heire of old {Tyberio}.
713    <S {Iuli}.> What's he that now is going out of doore?
714    <S {Nur}.> Marrie that I thinke be young {Petruchio}.
715   *<S {Iul}.> What's he that follows here that would not dance?
716    <S {Nur}.> I know not.
717    <S {Iul}.> Go aske his name: if he be married,
718    My graue is like to be my wedded bed.
719    <S {Nur}.> His name is {Romeo}, and a {Mountague},
720    The onely Sonne of your great Enemie.
721    <S {Iul}.> My onely Loue sprung from my onely hate,
722    Too early  seene, vnknowne, and knowne too late,
723    Prodigious birth of Loue it is to me,
724    That I must loue a loathed Enemie.
725    <S {Nur}.> What's this? whats this?
726    <S {Iul}.> A rime, I learne euen now
727    Of one I dan'st withall.
728    <D {One cals within, Iuliet}.>
729    <S {Nur}.> Anon, anon:
730    Come let's away, the strangers all are gone.
731    <D {Exeunt}.>
732    <S {Chorus}.>
733    Now old desire doth in his death bed lie,
734    And yong affection gapes to be his Heire,
735    That faire, for which Loue gron'd for and would die,
736    With tender {Iuliet} matcht, is now not faire.
737    Now {Romeo} is beloued, and Loues againe,
738    #A like bewitched by the charme of lookes:
739    But to his foe suppos'd he must complaine,
740    And she steale Loues sweet bait from fearefull hookes:
741    Being held a foe, he may not haue accesse
742    To breath such vowes as Louers vse to sweare,
743    And she as much in Loue, her meanes much lesse,
744    To meete her new Beloued any where:
745    But passion lends them Power, time, meanes to meete,
746    Temp'ring extremities with extreame sweete.
747    <D {Enter Romeo alone}.>
748    <S {Rom}.> Can I goe forward when my heart is here?
749    Turne backe dull earth, and find thy Center out.
750    <D {Enter Benuolio, with Mercutio}.>
751    <S {Ben}.> {Romeo}, my Cozen {Romeo}, {Romeo}.
752    <S {Merc}.> He is wise,
753    And on my life hath stolne him home to bed.
754    <S {Ben}.> He ran this way and leapt this Orchard wall.
755    Call good {Mercutio}:
756    Nay, Ile coniure too.
      <P ee6>
757    <S {Mer}.> {Romeo}, Humours, Madman, Passion, Louer,
758    Appeare thou in the likenesse of a sigh,
759    Speake but one time, and I am satisfied:
760    Cry me but ay  me, Prouant, but Loue and day,
761    Speake to my goship {Venus} one faire word,
762    One Nickname for her purblind Sonne and her,
763    Young {Abraham Cupid} he that shot so true,
764    When King {Cophetua} lou'd the begger Maid,
765    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moueth not,
766    The Ape is dead, I must coniure him,
767    I coniure thee by {Rosalines} bright eyes,
768    By her High forehead, and her Scarlet lip,
769    By her Fine foote, Straight  leg, and Quiuering thigh,
770    And the Demeanes, that there Adiacent lie,
771    That in thy likenesse thou appeare to vs.
772    <S {Ben}.> #And if he heare thee thou wilt anger him.
773    <S {Mer}.> This cannot anger him, t'would anger him
774    To raise a spirit in his Mistresse circle,
775    Of some strange nature, letting it stand
776    Till she had laid it, and coniured it downe,
777    That were some spight.
778   *My inuocation is faire and honest, & in his Mistris name,
779    I coniure onely but to raise vp him.
780    <S {Ben}.> Come, he hath hid himselfe among these Trees
781    To be consorted with the Humerous night:
782    Blind is his Loue, and best befits the darke.
783    <S {Mer}.> If Loue be blind, Loue cannot hit the marke,
784    Now will he sit vnder a Medler tree,
785    And wish his Mistresse were that kind of Fruite,
786    As Maides cal Medlers when they laugh alone,
787    O {Romeo} that she were, O that she were
788    An open, or thou a Poprin Peare,
789    {#Romeo} goodnight, Ile to my Truckle bed,
790    This Field- bed is #to cold for me to sleepe,
791    Come shall we go?
792    <S {Ben}.> Go then, for 'tis in vaine to seeke him here
793    That meanes not to be found. <D {Exeunt}.>
794    <S {Rom}.> He ieasts at Scarres that neuer felt a wound,
795    But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
796    It is the East, and {Iuliet} is the Sunne,
797    Arise faire Sun and kill the enuious Moone,
798    Who is already sicke and pale with griefe,
799    That thou her Maid art far more faire then she:
800    Be not her Maid since she is enuious,
801    Her Vestal liuery is but sicke and greene,
802    And none but fooles do weare it, cast it off:
803   *It is my Lady, O it is my Loue, O that she knew she were,
804    She speakes, yet she sayes nothing, what of that?
805    Her eye discourses, I will answere it:
806    I am too bold 'tis not to me she speakes:
807    Two of the fairest starres in all the Heauen,
808    Hauing some businesse do entreat her eyes,
809    To twinckle in their Spheres till they returne.
810    What if her eyes were there, they in her head,
811   *The brightnesse of her cheeke would shame those starres,
812    As day- light doth a Lampe, her eye in heauen,
813    Would through the ayrie Region streame so bright,
814    That Birds would sing, and thinke it were not night:
815    See how she leanes her cheeke vpon her hand.
816    O that I were a Gloue vpon that hand,
817    That I might touch that cheeke.
818    <S {Iul}.> Ay me.
819    <S {Rom}.> She speakes.
820    Oh speake againe bright Angell, for thou art
821    As glorious to this night being ore my head,
822    As is a winged messenger of heauen
823    Vnto the white vpturned wondring eyes
824    Of mortalls that fall backe to gaze on him,
825    When he bestrides the lazie puffing Cloudes,
826    And sailes vpon the bosome of the ayre.
827    <S {Iul}.> O {Romeo}, {Romeo}, wherefore art thou {Romeo}?
828    Denie thy Father and refuse thy name:
829    Or if thou wilt not, be but sworne to my Loue,
830    And Ile no longer be a {Capulet}.
831    <S {Rom}.> Shall I heare more, or shall I speake at this?
832    <S {Iu}.> 'Tis but thy name that is my Enemy:
833    Thou art thy selfe, though not a {Mountague},
834    What's {Mountague}? it is nor hand nor foote,
835    Nor arme, nor face, O be some other name
836    Belonging to a man.
837    What? in a names that which we call a Rose,
838    By any other word would smell as sweete,
839    So {Romeo} would, were he not {Romeo} cal'd,
840    Retaine that deare perfection which he owes,
841    Without that title {Romeo}, doffe thy name,
842    And for thy name which is no part of thee,
843    Take all my selfe.
844    <S {Rom}.> I take thee at thy word:
845    Call me but Loue, and Ile be new baptiz'd,
846    Hence foorth I neuer will be {Romeo}.
847   *<S {Iuli}.> What man art thou, that thus bescreen'd in night
848    So stumblest on my counsell?
849    <S {Rom}.> By a name,
850    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
851    My name deare Saint, is hatefull to my selfe,
852    Because it is an Enemy to thee,
853    Had I it written, I would teare the word.
854    <S {Iuli}.> My eares haue yet not drunke a hundred words
855    Of thy tongues vttering, yet I know the sound.
856    Art thou not {Romeo}, and a {Montague}?
857    <S {Rom}.> Neither faire Maid, if either thee dislike.
858    <S {Iul}.> How cam'st thou hither.
859    Tell me, and wherefore?
860    The Orchard walls are high, and hard to climbe,
861    And the place death, considering who thou art,
862    If any of my kinsmen find thee here,
863    <S {Rom}.> With Loues light wings
864    Did I ore- perch these Walls,
865    For stony limits cannot hold Loue out,
866    And what Loue can do, that dares Loue attempt:
867    Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
868    <S {Iul}.> If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
869    <S {Rom}.> Alacke there lies more perill in thine eye,
870    Then twenty of their Swords, looke thou but sweete,
871    And I am proofe against their enmity.
872    <S {Iul}.> I would not for the world they saw thee here.
873    <S {Rom}.> I haue nights cloake to hide me from their eyes
874    #And but thou loue me, let them finde me here,
875    My life were better ended by their hate,
876    Then death proroged wanting of thy Loue.
877   *<S {Iul}.> By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
878    <S {Rom}.> By Loue that first did prompt me to enquire,
879    He lent me counsell, and I lent him eyes,
880    I am no Pylot, yet wert thou as far
881    As that vast- shore- washet with the farthest Sea,
882    I should aduenture for such Marchandise.
883    <S {Iul}.> Thou knowest the maske of night is on my face,
884    Else would a Maiden blush bepaint my cheeke,
885    For that which thou hast heard me speake to night,
886    Faine would I dwell on forme, faine, faine, denie
887    What I haue spoke, but farewell Complement,
888    Doest thou Loue? I know thou wilt say #I,
      <P ee6v>
889    And I will take thy word, yet if thou swear'st,
890    Thou maiest proue false: at Louers periuries
891    They say {Ioue} laught, oh gentle {Romeo},
892    If thou dost Loue, pronounce it faithfully:
893    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly wonne,
894    Ile frowne and be peruerse, and say thee nay,
895    So thou wilt wooe: But else not for the world.
896    In truth faire {Mountague} I am too fond:
897    And therefore thou maiest thinke my behauiour light,
898    But trust me Gentleman, Ile proue more true,
899    Then those that haue coying to be strange,
900    I should haue beene more strange, I must confesse,
901    But that thou ouer heard'st ere I was ware
902    My true Loues passion, therefore pardon me,
903    And not impute this yeelding to light Loue,
904    Which the darke night hath so discouered.
905    <S {Rom}.> Lady, by yonder Moone I vow,
906    That tips with siluer all these Fruite tree tops.
907   *<S {Iul}.> O sweare not by the Moone, th' inconstant Moone,
908    That monethly changes in her circled Orbe,
909    Least that thy Loue proue likewise variable.
910    <S {Rom}.> What shall I sweare by?
911    <S {Iul}.> Do not sweare at all:
912    Or if thou wilt sweare by thy gratious selfe,
913    Which is the God of my Idolatry,
914    And Ile beleeue thee.
915    <S {Rom}.> If my hearts deare loue.
916    <S {Iuli}.> Well do not sweare, although I ioy in thee:
917    I haue no ioy of this contract to night,
918    It is too rash, too vnaduis'd, too sudden,
919    Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
920    Ere, one can say, it lightens, Sweete good night:
921    This bud of Loue by Summers ripening breath,
922    May proue a beautious Flower when next we meete:
923    Goodnight, goodnight, as sweete repose and rest,
924    Come to thy heart, as that within my brest.
925    <S {Rom}.> O wilt thou leaue me so vnsatisfied?
926    <S {Iuli}.> What satisfaction can'st thou haue to night?
927   *<S {Ro}.> Th' exchange of thy Loues faithfull vow for mine.
928    <S {Iul}.> I gaue thee mine before thou did'st request it:
929    And yet I would it were to giue againe.
930    <S {Rom}.> Would'st thou withdraw it,
931    For what purpose Loue?
932    <S {Iul}.> But to be franke and giue it thee againe,
933    And yet I wish but for the thing I haue,
934    My bounty is as boundlesse as the Sea,
935    My Loue as deepe, the more I giue to thee
936    The more I haue, for both are Infinite:
937    I heare some noyse within deare Loue adue:
938    <D {Cals within}.>
939    Anon good Nurse, sweet {Mountague} be true:
940    Stay but a little, I will come againe.
941    <S {Rom}.> O blessed blessed night, I am afear'd
942    Being in night, all this is but a dreame,
943    Too flattering sweet to be substantiall.
944    <S {Iul}.> Three words deare {Romeo},
945    And goodnight indeed,
946    If that thy bent of Loue be Honourable,
947    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to morrow,
948    By one that Ile procure to come to thee,
949    Where and what time thou wilt performe the right,
950    And all my Fortunes at thy foote Ile lay,
951    And follow thee my Lord throughout the world.
952    <S {Within:}> Madam.
953    I come, anon: but if thou meanest not well,
954    I do beseech thee  <S {Within}:> Madam.
955    (By and #by I come)
956    To cease thy strife, and leaue me to my griefe,
957    To morrow will I send.
958    <S {Rom}.> So thriue my soule.
959    <S {Iu}.> A thousand times goodnight. <D {Exit}.>
960   *<S {Rome}.> A thousand times the worse to want thy light,
961   *Loue goes toward  Loue as school- boyes fro[m] their books
962   *But Loue fro[m] Loue, towards schoole with heauie lookes.
963    <D {Enter Iuliet againe}.>
964    <S {Iul}.> Hist {Romeo} hist: O for a Falkners voice,
965    To lure this Tassell gentle backe againe,
966    Bondage is  hoarse, and may not speake aloud,
967    Else would I teare the Caue where Eccho lies,
968    And make her ayrie tongue more hoarse, then
969    With repetition of my {Romeo}.
970    <S {Rom}.> It is my soule that calls vpon my name.
971    How siluer sweet, sound Louers tongues by night,
972    Like softest Musicke to attending eares.
973    <S {Iul}.> {Romeo}.
974    <S {Rom}.> My Neece.
975    <S {Iul}.> What #a clock to morrow
976    Shall I send to thee?
977    <S {Rom}.> By the houre of nine.
978    <S {Iul}.> I will not faile, 'tis twenty yeares till then,
979    I haue forgot why I did call thee backe.
980    <S {Rom}.> Let me stand here till thou remember it.
981    <S {Iul}.> I shall forget, to haue thee still stand there,
982    Remembring how I Loue thy company.
983    <S {Rom}.> And Ile still stay, to haue thee still forget,
984    Forgetting any other home but this.
985    <S {Iul}.> 'Tis almost morning, I would haue thee gone,
986    And yet no further then a wantons Bird,
987    That let's it hop a little from his hand,
988    Like a poore prisoner in his twisted Gyues,
989    And with a silken thred plucks it backe againe,
990    So louing Iealous of his liberty.
991    <S {Rom}.> I would I were thy Bird.
992    <S {Iul}.> Sweet so would I,
993    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing:
994    Good night, good night.
995    <S {Rom}.> Parting is such sweete sorrow,
996    That I shall say goodnight, till it be morrow.
997   *<S {Iul}.> Sleepe dwell vpon thine eyes, peace in thy brest.
998   *<S {Rom}.> Would I were sleepe and peace so sweet to rest,
999    The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,
1000   Checkring the Easterne Clouds with streakes of light,
1001   And darkenesse fleckel'd like a drunkard reeles,
1002   From forth dayes pathway, made by {Titans} wheeles.
1003   Hence will I to my ghostly Friers close Cell,
1004   His helpe to craue, and my deare hap to tell. <D {Exit}.>
1005   <D {Enter Frier alone with a basket}.>
1006  *<S {Fri}.> The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,
1007   Checkring the Easterne Cloudes with streaks of light:
1008   And fleckled darknesse like a drunkard reeles,
1009   From forth daies path, and {Titans} burning wheeles:
1010   Now ere the Sun aduance his burning eye,
1011   The day to cheere, and nights danke dew to dry,
1012   I must vpfill this Osier Cage of ours,
1013   With balefull weedes, and precious Iuiced flowers,
1014   The earth that's Natures mother, is her Tombe,
1015   What is her burying graue that is her wombe:
1016   And from her wombe children of diuers kind
      <P ff1>
1017   We sucking on her naturall bosome find:
1018   Many for many vertues excellent:
1019   None but for some, and yet all different.
1020   O mickle is the powerfull grace that lies
1021   In Plants, Hearbs, stones, and their true qualities:
1022   For nought so vile, that on earth doth liue,
1023   But to the earth some speciall good doth giue.
1024   Nor ought so good, but strain'd from that faire vse,
1025   Reuolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
1026   Vertue it selfe turnes vice being misapplied,
1027   And vice sometime by action dignified.
1028   <D {Enter Romeo}.>
1029   Within the infant rind of this weake flower,
1030   Poyson hath residence, and medicine power:
1031   For this being smelt, with that part cheares each part,
1032   Being tasted stayes all sences with the heart.
1033   Two such opposed Kings encampe them still,
1034   In man as well as Hearbes, grace and rude will:
1035   And where the worser is predominant,
1036   Full soone the Canker death eates vp that Plant.
1037   <S {Rom}.> Good morrow Father.
1038   <S {Fri}.> Benedecite.
1039   What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1040   Young Sonne, it argues a distempered  head,
1041   So soone to bid goodmorrow to thy bed;
1042   Care keepes his watch in euery old mans eye,
1043   And where Care lodges, sleepe will neuer lye:
1044   But where vnbrused youth with vnstuft braine
1045   Doth couch his lims, there, golden sleepe doth raigne;
1046   Therefore thy earlinesse doth me assure,
1047   Thou art vprous'd with some distemprature;
1048   Or if not so, then here I hit it right.
1049   Our {Romeo} hath not beene in bed to night.
1050   <S {Rom}.> That last is true, the sweeter rest was mine.
1051   <S {Fri}.> God pardon sin: wast thou with {Rosaline}?
1052   <S {Rom}.> With {Rosaline}, my ghostly Father? No,
1053   I haue forgot that name, and that names woe.
1054  *<S {Fri}.> That's my good Son, but wher hast thou bin then?
1055   <S {Rom}.> Ile tell thee ere thou aske it me agen:
1056   I haue beene feasting with mine enemie,
1057   Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1058   That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1059   Within thy helpe and holy phisicke lies:
1060   I beare no hatred, blessed man: for loe
1061   My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1062   <S {Fri}.> Be plaine good Son, rest homely in thy drift,
1063   Ridling confession, findes but ridling shrift.
1064  *<S {Rom}.> Then plainly know my hearts deare Loue is set,
1065   On the faire daughter of rich {Capulet}:
1066   As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1067   And all combin'd, saue what thou must combine
1068   By holy marriage: when and where, and how,
1069   We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow:
1070   Ile tell thee as we passe, but this I pray,
1071   That thou consent to marrie vs to day.
1072   <S {Fri}.> Holy S[aint]. {Francis}, what a change is heere?
1073   Is {Rosaline} that thou didst Loue so deare
1074   So soone forsaken? young mens Loue then lies
1075   Not truely in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1076   Iesu {Maria}, what a deale of brine
1077   Hath washt thy sallow cheekes for {Rosaline}?
1078   How much salt water throwne away in #wast,
1079   To season Loue that of it doth not tast.
1080   The Sun not yet thy sighes, from heauen cleares,
1081   Thy old grones yet ringing in my auncient eares:
1082   Lo here vpon thy cheeke the staine doth sit,
1083   Of an old teare that is not washt off yet.
1084   If ere thou wast thy selfe, and these woes thine,
1085   Thou and these woes, were all for {Rosaline}.
1086   And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then,
1087   Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1088   <S {Rom}.> Thou chid'st me oft for louing {Rosaline}.
1089   <S {Fri}.> For doting, not for louing pupill mine.
1090   <S {Rom}.> And bad'st me bury Loue.
1091   <S {Fri}.> Not in a graue,
1092   To lay one in, another out to haue.
1093   <S {Rom}.> I pray thee chide me not, her I Loue now
1094   Doth grace for grace, and Loue for Loue allow:
1095   The other did not so.
1096   <S {Fri}.> O she knew well,
1097   Thy Loue did read by rote, that could not spell:
1098   But come young wauerer, come goe with me,
1099   In one respect, Ile thy assistant be:
1100   For this alliance may so happy proue,
1101   To turne your houshould rancor to pure Loue.
1102   <S {Rom}.> O let vs hence, I stand on sudden #hast.
1103   <S {Fri}.> Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast.
1104   <D {Exeunt}>
1105   <D {Enter Benuolio and Mercutio}.>
1106  *<S {Mer}.> Where the deule should this {Romeo} be? came he
1107   not home to night?
1108   <S {Ben}.> Not to his Fathers, I spoke with his man.
1109  *<S {Mer}.> Why that same pale hard- harted wench, that {Ro-saline}
1110   torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1111  *<S {Ben}.> {Tibalt}, the kinsman to old {Capulet}, hath sent a Let-ter
1112   to his Fathers house.
1113   <S {Mer}.> A challenge on my life.
1114   <S {Ben}.> {Romeo} will answere it.
1115   <S {Mer}.> Any man that can write, may answere a Letter.
1116  *<S {Ben}.> Nay, he will answere the Letters Maister how he
1117   dares, being dared.
1118  *<S {Mer}.> Alas poore {Romeo}, he is already dead stab'd with
1119  *a white wenches blacke eye, runne through the eare with
1120  *a Loue song, the very pinne of his heart, cleft with the
1121  *blind Bowe- boyes but- shaft, and is he a man to encounter
1122   {Tybalt}?
1123   <S {Ben}.> Why what is {Tibalt}?
1124  *<S {Mer}.> More then Prince of Cats. Oh hee's  the Couragi-ous
1125  *Captaine of Complements: he fights as you sing
1126  *pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion, he rests
1127  *his minum, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the ve-ry
1128  *butcher of a silk button, a Dualist, a Dualist: a Gentleman
1129  *of the very first house of the first and second cause: ah the
1130   immortall Passado, the Punto reuerso, the Hay.
1131   <S {Ben}.> The what?
1132  *<S {Mer}.> The Pox of such antique lisping affecting phan-tacies,
1133  *these new tuners of accent: Iesu a very good blade,
1134  *a very tall man, a very good whore. Why is not this a la-mentable
1135  *thing Grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted
1136  *with these strange flies: these fashion Mongers, these par-don- mee's,
1137  *who stand so much on the new form, that they
1138  *cannot sit at ease on the old bench. O their bones, their
1139   bones.
1140   <D {Enter Romeo}.>
1141   <S {Ben}.> Here comes {Romeo}, here comes {Romeo}.
1142  *<S {Mer}.> Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering. O flesh,
1143  *flesh, how art thou fishified? Now is he for the numbers
1144  *that {Petrarch} flowed in: {Laura} to his Lady, was a kitchen
1145  *wench, marrie she had a better Loue to berime her: {Dido}
1146  *a dowdie, {Cleopatra} a Gipsie, {Hellen} and {Hero}, hildings
1147  *and Harlots: {Thisbie} a gray eie or so, but not to the purpose.
1148  *Signior {Romeo}, {Bon iour}, there's a French salutation to your
      <P ff1v>
1149  *French slop: you gaue vs the counterfait fairely last
1150   night.
1151  *<S {Romeo}.> Good morrow to you both, what counterfeit
1152   did I giue you?
1153   <S {Mer}.> The slip sir, the slip, can you not conceiue?
1154  *<S {Rom}.> Pardon {Mercutio}, my businesse was great, and in
1155   such a case as mine, a man may straine curtesie.
1156  *<S {Mer}.> That's as much as to say, such a case as yours con-strains
1157   a man to bow in the hams.
1158   <S {Rom}.> Meaning to cursie.
1159   <S {Mer}.> Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1160   <S {Rom}.> A most curteous exposition.
1161   <S {Mer}.> Nay, I am the very pinck of curtesie.
1162   <S {Rom}.> Pinke for flower.
1163   <S {Mer}.> Right.
1164   <S {Rom}.> Why then is my Pump well flowr'd.
1165  *<S {Mer}.> Sure wit, follow me this ieast, now till thou hast
1166  *worne out thy Pump, that when the single sole of it is
1167  *worne, the ieast may remaine after the wearing, sole- singular.
1168  _
1169   <S {Rom}.> O single sol'd ieast,
1170   Soly singular for the singlenesse.
1171  *<S {Mer}.> Come betweene vs good {Benuolio}, my wits faints.
1172   <S {Rom}.> Swits and spurs,
1173   Swits and spurs, or Ile crie a match.
1174  *<S {Mer}.> Nay, if our wits run the Wild- Goose chase, I am
1175  *done: For thou hast more of the Wild- Goose in one of
1176  *thy wits, then I am sure I haue in my whole fiue. Was I
1177   with you there for the Goose?
1178  *<S {Rom}.> Thou wast neuer with mee for any thing, when
1179   thou wast not there for the Goose.
1180   <S {Mer}.> I will bite thee by the eare for that iest.
1181   <S {Rom}.> Nay, good Goose bite not.
1182   <S {Mer}.> Thy wit is a very Bitter- sweeting,
1183   It is a most sharpe sawce.
1184   <S {Rom}.> And is it not well seru'd into a Sweet- Goose?
1185  *<S {Mer}.> Oh here's a wit of Cheuerell, that stretches from
1186   an ynch narrow, to an ell broad.
1187  *<S {Rom}.> I stretch it out for that word, broad, which added
1188   to the Goose, proues thee farre and wide, abroad Goose.
1189  *<S {Mer}.> Why is not this better now, then groning for
1190  *Loue, now art thou sociable, now art thou {Romeo}: now art
1191  *thou what thou art, by #Art as well as by Nature, for this
1192  *driueling Loue is like a great Naturall, that runs lolling
1193   vp and downe to hid his bable in a hole.
1194   <S {Ben}.> Stop there, stop there.
1195  *<S {Mer}.> Thou desir'st me to stop in my tale against the |(haire.
1196  *<S {Ben}.> Thou would'st else haue made thy tale large.
1197   <S {Mer}.> O thou art deceiu'd, I would haue made it short,
1198  *or I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant
1199   indeed to occupie the argument no longer.
1200   <D {Enter Nurse and her man}.>
1201   <S {Rom}.> Here's a goodly geare.
1202   A sayle, a sayle.
1203   <S {Mer}.> Two, two: a Shirt and a Smocke.
1204   <S {Nur}.> {Peter}?
1205   <S {Peter}.> Anon.
1206   <S {Nur}.> My Fan {Peter}?
1207   <S {Mer}.> Good {Peter} to hide her face?
1208   For her Fans the fairer face?
1209   <S {Nur}.> God ye good morrow Gentlemen.
1210   <S {Mer}.> God ye gooden faire Gentlewoman.
1211   <S {Nur}.> Is it gooden?
1212  *<S {Mer}.> 'Tis no lesse I tell you: for the bawdy hand of the
1213   Dyall is now vpon the pricke of Noone.
1214   <S {Nur}.> Out vpon you: what a man are you?
1215   <S {Rom}.> One Gentlewoman,
1216   That God hath made, himselfe to mar.
1217  *<S {Nur}.> By my troth it is said, for himselfe to, mar qua-tha:
1218  *Gentlemen, can any of you tel me where I may find
1219   the young {Romeo}?
1220  *<S {Romeo}.> I can tell you: but young {Romeo} will be older
1221  *when you haue found him, then he was when you sought
1222  *him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1223   <S {Nur}.> You say well.
1224   <S {Mer}.> Yea is the worst well,
1225   Very well tooke: Ifaith, wisely, wisely.
1226   <S {Nur}.> If you be he sir,
1227   I desire some confidence with you?
1228   <S {Ben}.> She will endite him to some Supper.
1229   <S {Mer}.> A baud, a baud, a baud. So ho.
1230   <S {Rom}.> What hast thou found?
1231  *<S {Mer}.> No Hare sir, vnlesse a Hare sir in a Lenten pie,
1232   that is something stale and hoare ere it be spent.
1233  *An  old Hare hoare, and an old Hare hoare is very good
1234   meat in Lent.
1235  *But a Hare that is hoare is too much for a score, when it
1236   hoares ere it be spent,
1237  *{#Romeo} will you come to your Fathers? Weele to dinner
1238   thither.
1239   <S {Rom}.> I will follow you.
1240   <S {Mer}.> Farewell auncient Lady:
1241   Farewell Lady, Lady, Lady.
1242   <D {Exit. Mercutio, Benuolio}.>
1243  *<S {Nur}.> I pray you sir, what sawcie Merchant was this
1244   that was so full of his roperie?
1245  *<S {Rom}.> A Gentleman Nurse, that loues to heare himselfe
1246  *talke, and will speake more in a minute, then he will stand
1247   to in a Moneth.
1248  *<S {Nur}.> #And #a speake any thing against me, Ile take him
1249  *downe, #z #a were lustier then he is, and twentie such Iacks:
1250  *and if I cannot, Ile finde those that shall: scuruie knaue, I
1251  *am none of his flurt- gils, I am none of his skaines mates,
1252  *and thou must stand by too and suffer euery knaue to vse
1253   me at his pleasure.
1254  *<S {Pet}.>  I saw no man vse you at his pleasure: if I had, my
1255  *weapon should quickly haue beene out, I warrant you, I
1256  *dare draw assoone as another man, if I see occasion in a
1257   good quarrell, and the law on my side.
1258  *<S {Nur}.> Now afore God, I am so vext, that euery part about
1259  *me quiuers, skuruy knaue: pray you sir a word: and as I
1260  *told you, my young Lady bid me enquire you out, what
1261  *she bid me say, I will keepe to my selfe: but first let me
1262  *tell ye, if ye should leade her in a fooles paradise, as they
1263  *say, it were a very grosse kind of behauiour, as they say:
1264  *for the Gentlewoman is yong: & therefore, if you should
1265  *deale double with her, truely it were an #ill thing to be of-fered
1266   to any Gentlewoman, and very weake dealing.
1267  *<S {Nur}.> Nurse commend me to thy Lady and Mistresse, I
1268   protest vnto thee.
1269  *<S {Nur}.> Good heart, and yfaith I will tell her as much:
1270   Lord, Lord she will be a ioyfull woman.
1271  *<S {Rom}.> What wilt thou tell her Nurse? thou doest not
1272   marke me?
1273  *<S {Nur}.> I will tell her sir, that you do protest, which as I
1274   take it, is a Gentleman- like offer.
1275  *<S {Rom}.> Bid her deuise some meanes to come to shrift this |(afternoone,
1276   And there she shall at Frier {Lawrence} Cell
1277   Be shriu'd and married: here is for thy paines.
1278   <S {Nur}.> No truly sir not a penny.
1279   <S {Rom}.> Go #too, I say you shall.
      <P ff2>
1280   <S {Nur}.> This afternoone sir? well she shall be there.
1281  *<S {Ro}.> And stay thou good Nurse behind the Abbey wall,
1282   Within this houre my man shall be with thee,
1283   And bring thee Cords made like a tackled staire,
1284   Which to the high top gallant of my ioy,
1285   Must be my conuoy in the secret night.
1286   Farewell, be trustie and Ile quite thy paines:
1287   Farewell, commend me to thy Mistresse.
1288   <S {Nur}.> Now God in heauen blesse thee: harke you sir,
1289   <S {Rom}.> What saist thou my deare Nurse?
1290  *<S {Nurse}.> Is your man secret, did you nere heare say two
1291   may keepe counsell putting one away.
1292   <S {Ro}.> Warrant thee my man is true as steele.
1293  *<S {Nur}.> Well sir, my Mistresse is the sweetest Lady, Lord,
1294  *Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing. O there is a No-ble
1295  *man in Towne one {Paris}, that would faine lay knife a-board:
1296  *but she good soule had as leeue see a Toade, a very
1297  *Toade as see him: I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
1298  *{Paris} is the properer man, but Ile warrant you, when I say
1299  *so, shee lookes as pale as any clout in the versall world.
1300  *Doth not Rosemarie and {Romeo} begin both with a letter?
1301   <S {Rom}.> #I Nurse, what of that? Both  with an {R}
1302  *<S {Nur}.> #A mocker that's the dogs name. {R}. is for the no,
1303  *I know it begins with some other letter, and she hath the
1304  *prettiest sententious of it, of you and Rosemary, that it
1305   would do you good to heare it.
1306   <S {Rom}.> Commend me to thy Lady.
1307   <S {Nur}.> #I a thousand times. {Peter}?
1308   <S {Pet}.> Anon.
1309   <S {Nur}.> Before and apace. <D {Exit Nurse and Peter}.>
1310   <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
1311  *<S {Iul}.> The clocke strook nine, when I did send the Nurse,
1312   In halfe an houre she promised to returne,
1313   Perchance she cannot meete him: that's not so:
1314   Oh she is lame, Loues Herauld should be thoughts,
1315   Which ten times faster glides then the Sunnes beames,
1316   Driuing backe shadowes ouer lowring hils.
1317   Therefore do nimble Pinion'd Doues draw Loue,
1318   And therefore hath the wind- swift {Cupid} wings:
1319   Now is the Sun vpon the highmost hill
1320   Of this daies iourney, and from nine till twelue,
1321   Is three long houres, yet she is not come.
1322   Had she affections and warme youthfull blood,
1323   She would be as swift in motion as a ball,
1324   My words would bandy her to my sweete Loue,
1325   And his to me, but old folkes,
1326   Many faine as they were dead,
1327   Vnwieldie, slow, heauy, and pale as lead.
1328   <D {Enter Nurse}.>
1329   O God she comes, O hony Nurse what newes?
1330   Hast thou met with him? send thy man away.
1331   <S {Nur}.> {Peter} stay at the gate.
1332   <S {Iul}.> Now good sweet Nurse:
1333   O Lord, why lookest thou sad?
1334   Though newes, be sad, yet tell them merrily.
1335   If good thou sham'st the musicke of sweet newes,
1336   By playing it to me, with so sower a face.
1337   <S {Nur}.> I am #a weary, giue me leaue awhile,
1338   Fie how my bones ake, what a iaunt haue I had?
1339   <S {Iul}.> I would thou had'st my bones, and I thy newes:
1340   Nay come I pray thee speake, good good Nurse speake.
1341   <S {Nur}.> Iesu what #hast? can you not stay #a while?
1342   Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1343  *<S {Iul}.> How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breth
1344   To say to me, that thou art out of breath?
1345   The excuse that thou dost make in this delay,
1346   Is longer then the tale thou dost excuse.
1347   Is thy newes good or bad? answere to that,
1348   Say either, and Ile stay the circumstance:
1349   Let me be satisfied, ist good or bad?
1350  *<S {Nur}.> Well, you haue made a simple choice, you know
1351  *not how to chuse a man: {Romeo}, no not he though his face
1352  *be better then any mans, yet his legs excels all mens, and
1353  *for a hand, and a foote, and a body, though they be not to
1354  *be talkt on, yet they are past compare: he is not the flower
1355  *of curtesie, but Ile warrant him as gentle a Lambe: go thy
1356  *waies wench, serue God. What haue you din'd at home?
1357   <S {Iul}.> No no: but all  this did I know before
1358   What saies he of our marriage? what of that?
1359   <S {Nur}.> Lord how my head akes, what a head haue I?
1360   It beates as it would fall in twenty peeces.
1361   My backe #a tother side: o my backe, my backe:
1362   Beshrew your heart for sending me about
1363   To catch my death with iaunting vp and downe.
1364   <S {Iul}.> Ifaith: I am sorrie  that thou art so well.
1365   Sweet sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me what saies my Loue?
1366   <S {Nur}.> Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman,
1367   And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
1368   And I warrant a vertuous: where is your Mother?
1369   <S {Iul}.> Where is my Mother?
1370   Why she is within, where should she be?
1371   How odly thou repli'st:
1372   Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman:
1373   Where is your Mother?
1374   <S {Nur}.> O Gods Lady deare,
1375   Are you so hot? marrie come vp I trow,
1376   Is this the Poultis for my aking bones?
1377   Henceforward do your messages your selfe.
1378   <S {Iul}.> Heere's such a coile, come what saies {Romeo}?
1379   <S {Nur}.> Haue you got leaue to go to shift to day?
1380   <S {Iul}.> I haue.
1381   <S {Nur}.>  Then high you hence to Frier {Lawrence} Cell,
1382   There staies a Husband to make you a wife:
1383   Now comes the wanton bloud vp in your cheekes,
1384   Thei'le be in Scarlet straight at any newes:
1385   Hie you to Church, I must an other way,
1386   To fetch a Ladder by the which your Loue
1387   Must climde a birds nest Soone when it is darke:
1388   I am the drudge, and toile in your delight:
1389   But you shall beare the burthen soone at night.
1390   Go Ile to dinner, hie you to the Cell.
1391  *<S {Iul}.> Hie to high Fortune, honest Nurse, farewell. <D {Exeunt}.>
1392   <D {Enter Frier and Romeo}.>
1393   <S {Fri}.> So smile the heauens vpon this holy act,
1394   That after houres, with sorrow chide vs not.
1395   <S {Rom}.> Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
1396   It cannot counteruaile the exchange of ioy
1397   That one short minute giues me in her sight:
1398   Do thou but close our hands with holy words.
1399   Then Loue- deuouring death do what he dare,
1400   It is inough. I may call her mine.
1401   <S {Fri}.> These violent delights haue violent endes,
1402   And in their triumph: die like fire and powder;
1403   Which as they kisse consume. The sweetest honey
1404   Is loathsome in his owne deliciousnesse,
1405   And in the taste confoundes the appetite.
1406   Therefore Loue moderately, long Loue doth so,
1407   Too swift arriues as tardie as too slow.
1408   <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
1409   Here comes the Lady. Oh so light a foot
1410   Will nere weare out the euerlasting flint,
      <P ff2v>
1411   A Louer may bestride the Gossamours,
1412   That ydles in the wanton Summer ayre,
1413   And yet not fall, so light is vanitie.
1414   <S {Iul}.> Good euen to my ghostly Confessor.
1415   <S {Fri}.> {Romeo} shall thanke thee Daughter for vs both.
1416   <S {Iul}.> As much to him, else in his thanks too much.
1417   <S {Fri}.> Ah {Iuliet}, if the measure of thy ioy
1418   Be heapt like mine, and that thy skill be more
1419   To blason it, then sweeten with thy breath
1420   This neighbour ayre, and let rich musickes tongue,
1421   Vnfold the imagin'd happinesse that both
1422   Receiue in either, by this deere encounter.
1423   <S {Iul}.> Conceit more rich in matter then in words,
1424   Brags of his substance, not of Ornament:
1425   They are but beggers that can count their worth,
1426   But my true Loue is growne to such excesse,
1427   I cannot sum vp some of halfe my wealth.
1428  *<S {Fri}.> Come, come with me, & we will make short worke,
1429   For by your leaues, you shall not stay alone,
1430   Till holy Church incorporate two in one.
1431   <D {Enter Mercutio, Benuolio, and men}.>
1432   <S {Ben}.> I pray thee good {Mercutio} lets retire,
1433   The day is hot, the {Capulets} abroad:
1434  *#And if we meet, we shal not scape a brawle, for now these
1435   hot dayes, is the mad blood stirring.
1436  *<S {Mer}.> Thou art like one of these fellowes, that when he
1437  *enters the confines of a Tauerne, claps me his Sword vpon
1438  *the Table, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by
1439  *the operation of the second cup, drawes him on the Draw-er,
1440   when indeed there is no need.
1441   <S {Ben}.> Am I like such a Fellow?
1442  *<S {Mer}.> Come, come, thou art as hot a Iacke in thy mood,
1443  *as any in {Italie}: and assoone moued to be moodie, and as-soone
1444   moodie to be mou'd.
1445   <S {Ben}.> And what #too?
1446  *<S {Mer}.> Nay, #and there were two such, we should haue
1447  *none shortly, for one would kill the other: thou, why thou
1448  *wilt quarrell with a man that hath a haire more, or a haire
1449  *lesse in his beard, then thou hast: thou wilt quarrell with a
1450  *man for cracking Nuts, hauing no other reason, but be-cause
1451  *thou hast hasell eyes: what eye, but such an eye,
1452  *would spie out such a quarrell? thy head is full of quar-rels,
1453  *as an egge is full of meat, and yet thy head hath bin
1454  *beaten as addle as an egge for quarreling: thou hast quar-rel'd
1455  *with a man for coffing in the street, because he hath
1456  *wakened thy Dog that hath laine asleepe in the Sun. Did'st
1457  *thou not fall out with a Tailor for wearing his new Doub-let
1458  *before Easter? with another, for tying his new shooes
1459  *with old Riband, and yet thou wilt Tutor me from quar-relling?
1460  _
1461  *<S {Ben}.> #And I were so apt to quarell as thou art, any man
1462  *should buy the Fee- simple of my life, for an houre and a
1463   quarter.
1464   <S {Mer}.> The Fee- simple? O simple.
1465   <D {Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others}.>
1466   <S {Ben}.> By my head here comes the {Capulets}.
1467   <S {Mer}.> By my #heele I care not.
1468   <S {Tyb}.> Follow me close, for I will speake to them.
1469   Gentlemen, Good den, a word with one of you.
1470  *<S {Mer}.> #And but one word with one of vs? couple it with
1471   something, make it a word and a blow.
1472  *<S {Tib}.> You shall find me apt inough to that sir, #and you
1473   will giue me occasion.
1474  *<S {Mercu}.> Could you not take some occasion without
1475   giuing?
1476   <S {Tib}.> {Mercutio} thou consort'st with {Romeo}.
1477  *<S {Mer}.> Consort? what dost thou make vs Minstrels? #&
1478  *thou make Minstrels of vs, looke to heare nothing but dis-cords:
1479  *heere's my fiddlesticke, heere's that shall make you
1480   daunce. Come consort.
1481   <S {Ben}.> We talke here in the publike haunt of men,
1482   Either withdraw vnto some priuate place,
1483   Or reason coldly of your greeuances:
1484   Or else depart, here all eies gaze on vs.
1485  *<S {Mer}.> Mens eyes were made to looke, and let them gaze.
1486   I will not budge for no mans pleasure I.
1487   <D {Enter Romeo}.>
1488  *<S {Tib}.> Well peace be with you sir, here comes my man.
1489   <S {Mer}.> But Ile be hang'd sir if he weare your Liuery.
1490   Marry go before to field, heele be your follower,
1491   Your worship in that sense, may call him man.
1492   <S {Tib}.> {Romeo}, the loue I beare thee, can affoord
1493   No better terme then this: Thou art a Villaine.
1494   <S {Rom}.> {Tibalt}, the reason that I haue to loue thee,
1495   Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
1496   To such a greeting: Villaine am I none;
1497   Therefore farewell, I see thou know'st me not.
1498   <S {Tib}.> Boy, this shall not excuse the iniuries
1499   That thou hast done me, therefore turne and draw.
1500   <S {Rom}.> I do protest I neuer iniur'd thee,
1501   But lou'd thee better then thou can'st deuise:
1502   Till thou shalt know the reason of my loue,
1503   And so good {Capulet}, which name I tender
1504   As dearely as my owne, be satisfied.
1505   <S {Mer}.> O calme, dishonourable, vile submission:
1506   {Alla stucatho} carries it away.
1507   {Tybalt}, you Rat- catcher, will you walke?
1508   <S {Tib}.> What wouldst thou haue with me?
1509  *<S {Mer}.> Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine
1510  *liues, that I meane to make bold withall, and as you shall
1511  *vse me hereafter dry beate the rest of the eight. Will you
1512  *pluck your Sword out of his Pilcher by the eares? Make
1513   #hast, least mine be about your eares ere it be out.
1514   <S {Tib}.> I am for you.
1515   <S {Rom}.> Gentle {Mercutio}, put thy Rapier vp.
1516   <S {Mer}.> Come sir, your Passado.
1517   <S {Rom}.> Draw {Benuolio}, beat downe their weapons:
1518   Gentlemen, for shame forbeare this outrage,
1519   {Tibalt}, {Mercutio}, the Prince expresly hath
1520   Forbidden bandying in {Verona} streetes.
1521   Hold {Tybalt}, good {Mercutio}.
1522   <D {Exit Tybalt}.>
1523   <S {Mer}.> I am hurt.
1524   A plague #a both the Houses, I am sped:
1525   Is he gone and hath nothing?
1526   <S {Ben}.> What art thou hurt?
1527   <S {Mer}.> #I, #I, a scratch, a scratch, marry 'tis inough,
1528   Where is my Page? go Villaine fetch a Surgeon.
1529   <S {Rom}.> Courage man, the hurt cannot be much.
1530  *<S {Mer}.> No: 'tis not so deepe as a #well, nor so wide as a
1531  *Church doore, but 'tis inough, 'twill serue: aske for me to
1532  *morrow, and you shall find me a graue man. I am pepper'd
1533  *I warrant, for this world: a plague #a both your houses.
1534  *What, a Dog, a Rat, a Mouse, a Cat to scratch a man to
1535  *death: a Braggart, a Rogue, a Villaine, that fights by the
1536  *booke of Arithmeticke, why the deu'le came you be-tweene
1537   vs? I was hurt vnder your arme.
1538   <S {Rom}.> I thought all for the best.
1539   <S {Mer}.> Helpe me into some house {Benuolio},
1540   Or I shall faint: a plague #a both your houses.
1541   They haue made wormesmeat of me,
      <P ff3>
1542   I haue it, and soundly to your Houses. <D {Exit}.>
1543   <S {Rom}.> This Gentleman the Princes neere Alie,
1544   My very Friend hath got his mortall hurt
1545   In my behalfe, my reputation stain'd
1546   With {Tibalts} slaunder, {Tybalt} that an houre
1547   Hath beene my Cozin: O Sweet {Iuliet},
1548   Thy Beauty hath made me Effeminate,
1549   And in my temper softned Valours steele.
1550   <D {Enter Benuolio}.>
1551   <S {Ben}.> O {Romeo}, {Romeo}, braue {Mercutio}'s is dead,
1552   That Gallant spirit hath aspir'd the Cloudes,
1553   Which too vntimely here did scorne the earth.
1554  *<S {Rom}.> This daies blacke Fate, on mo daies depend,
1555   This but begins, the wo others must end.
1556   <D {Enter Tybalt}.>
1557   <S {Ben}.> Here comes the Furious {Tybalt} backe againe.
1558   <S {Rom}.> He gon in triumph, and {Mercutio} slaine?
1559   Away to heauen respectiue Lenitie,
1560   And fire and Fury, be my conduct now.
1561   Now {Tybalt} take the Villaine backe againe
1562   That late thou gau'st me, for {Mercutios} soule
1563   Is but a little way aboue our heads,
1564   Staying for thine to keepe him companie:
1565   Either thou or I, or both, must goe with him.
1566  *<S {Tib}.> Thou wretched Boy that didst consort him here,
1567   Shalt with him hence.
1568   <S {Rom}.> This shall determine that.
1569   <D {They fight. Tybalt falles}.>
1570   <S {Ben}.> {Romeo}, away be gone:
1571   The Citizens are vp, and {Tybalt} slaine,
1572   Stand not amaz'd, the Prince will Doome thee death
1573   If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away.
1574   <S {Rom}.> O! I am Fortunes foole.
1575   <S {Ben}.> Why dost thou stay?
1576   <D {Exit Romeo}.>
1577   <D {Enter Citizens}.>
1578   <S {Citi}.> Which way ran he that kild {Mercutio}?
1579   <S {Tibalt}> that Murtherer, which way ran he?
1580   <S {Ben}.> There lies that {Tybalt}.
1581   <S {Citi}.> Vp sir go with me:
1582   I charge thee in the Princes names obey.
1583   <D {Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their}
1584   {Wiues and all}.>
1585   <S {Prin}.> Where are the vile beginners of this Fray?
1586   <S {Ben}.> O Noble Prince, I can discouer all
1587   The vnluckie Mannage of this fatall brall:
1588   There lies the man slaine by young {Romeo},
1589   That slew thy kinsman braue {Mercutio}.
1590   <S {Cap}. {Wi}.> {Tybalt}, my Cozin? O my Brothers Child,
1591   O Prince,  O Cozin, Husband, O the blood is spild
1592   Of my deare kinsman. Prince as thou art true,
1593   For bloud of ours, shed bloud of {Mountague}.
1594   O Cozin, Cozin.
1595   <S {Prin}.> {Benuolio}, who began this Fray?
1596  *<S {Ben}.> {Tybalt} here slaine, whom {Romeo's} hand did slay,
1597   {#Romeo} that spoke him faire, bid him bethinke
1598   How nice the Quarrell was, and vrg'd withall
1599   Your high displeasure: all this vttered,
1600   With gentle breath, calme looke, knees humbly bow'd
1601   Could not take truce with the vnruly spleene
1602   Of {Tybalts} deafe to peace, but that he Tilts
1603   With Peircing steele at bold {Mercutio's} breast,
1604   Who all as hot, turnes deadly point to point,
1605   And with a Martiall scorne, with one hand beates
1606   Cold death aside, and with the other sends
1607   It back to {Tybalt}, whose dexterity
1608   Retorts it: {Romeo} he cries aloud,
1609   Hold Friends, Friends part, and swifter then his tongue,
1610   His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points,
1611   And twixt them rushes, vnderneath whose arme,
1612   An enuious thrust from {Tybalt}, hit the life
1613   Of stout {Mercutio}, and then {Tybalt} fled.
1614   But #by and by comes backe to {Romeo},
1615   Who had but newly entertained Reuenge,
1616   And too't they goe like lightning, for ere I
1617   Could draw to part them, was stout {Tybalt} slaine:
1618   And as he fell, did {Romeo} turne and flie:
1619   This is the truth, or let {Benuolio} die.
1620   <S {Cap}. {Wi}.> He is a kinsman to the {Mountague},
1621   Affection makes him false, he speakes not true:
1622   Some twenty of them fought in this blacke strife,
1623   And all those twenty could but kill one life.
1624   I beg for Iustice, which thou Prince must giue:
1625   {#Romeo} slew {Tybalt}, {Romeo} must not liue.
1626   <S {Prin}.> {Romeo} slew him, he slew {Mercutio},
1627   Who now the price of his deare blood doth owe.
1628   <S {Cap}.> Not {Romeo} Prince, he was {Mercutios} Friend,
1629   His fault concludes, but what the law should end,
1630   The life of {Tybalt}.
1631   <S {Prin}.> And for that offence,
1632   Immediately we doe exile him hence:
1633   I haue an interest in your hearts proceeding:
1634   My bloud for your rude brawles doth lie #a bleeding.
1635   But Ile Amerce you with so strong a fine,
1636   That you shall all repent the losse of mine.
1637   It will be deafe to pleading and excuses,
1638   Nor teares, nor prayers shall purchase our abuses.
1639   Therefore vse none, let {Romeo} hence in #hast,
1640   Else when he is found, that houre is his last.
1641   Beare hence his body, and attend our #will:
1642   Mercy not Murders, pardoning those that kill.
1643   <D {Exeunt}.>
1644   <D {Enter Iuliet alone}.>
1645   <S {Iul}.> Gallop apace, you fiery footed steedes,
1646   Towards {Phoebus} lodging, such a Wagoner
1647   As {Phaeton} would whip you to the west,
1648   And bring in Cloudie night immediately.
1649   Spred thy close Curtaine Loue- performing night,
1650   That run- awayes eyes may wincke, and {Romeo}
1651   Leape to these armes, vntalkt of and vnseene,
1652   Louers can see to doe their Amorous rights,
1653   And by their owne Beauties: or if Loue be blind,
1654   It best agrees with night: come ciuill night,
1655   Thou sober suted Matron all in blacke,
1656   And learne me how to loose a winning match,
1657   Plaid for a paire of stainlesse Maidenhoods,
1658   Hood my vnman'd blood bayting in my Cheekes,
1659   With thy Blacke mantle, till strange Loue grow bold,
1660   Thinke true Loue acted simple modestie:
1661   Come night, come {Romeo}, come thou day in night,
1662   For thou wilt lie vpon the wings of night
1663   Whiter then new Snow vpon a Rauens backe:
1664   Come gentle night, come louing blackebrow'd night.
1665   Giue me my {Romeo}, and when I shall die,
1666   Take him and cut him out in little starres,
1667   And he will make the Face of heauen so fine,
1668   That all the world will be in Loue with night,
1669   And pay no worship to the Garish Sun.
1670   O I haue bought the Mansion of a Loue,
1671   But not possest it, and though I am sold,
1672   Not yet enioy'd, so tedious is this day,
1673   As is the night before some Festiuall,
      <P ff3v>
1674   To an impatient child that hath new robes
1675   And may not weare them, O here comes my Nurse:
1676   <D {Enter Nurse with cords}.>
1677   And she brings newes and euery tongue that speaks
1678   But {Romeos} name, speakes heauenly eloquence:
1679   Now Nurse, what newes? what hast thou there?
1680   The Cords that {Romeo} bid thee fetch?
1681   <S {Nur}.> #I, #I, the Cords.
1682   <S {Iuli}.> Ay me, what newes?
1683   Why dost thou wring thy hands.
1684   <S {Nur}.> #A weladay, hee's dead, hee's dead,
1685   We are vndone Lady, we are vndone.
1686   Alacke the day, hee's gone, hee's kil'd, he's dead.
1687   <S {Iul}.> Can heauen be so enuious?
1688   <S {Nur}.> {Romeo} can,
1689   Though heauen cannot. O {Romeo}, {Romeo}.
1690   Who euer would haue thought it {Romeo}.
1691   <S {Iuli}.> What diuell art thou,
1692   That dost torment me thus?
1693   This torture should be roar'd in dismall #hell,
1694   Hath {Romeo} slaine himselfe? say thou but #I,
1695   And that bare vowell I shall poyson more
1696   Then the death- darting eye of Cockatrice,
1697   I am not I, if there be such an #I.
1698   Or those eyes shot, that makes thee answere #I:
1699   If he be slaine say #I, or if not, no.
1700   Briefe, sounds, determine of my weale or wo.
1701   <S {Nur}.> I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
1702   God saue the marke, here on his manly brest,
1703   A pitteous Coarse, a bloody piteous Coarse:
1704   Pale, pale as ashes, all bedawb'd in blood,
1705   All in gore blood I sounded at the sight.
1706   <S {Iul}.> O breake my heart,
1707   Poore Banckrout breake at once,
1708   To prison eyes, nere looke on libertie.
1709   Vile earth to earth resigne, end motion here,
1710   And thou and {Romeo} presse #on heauie beere.
1711   <S {Nur}.> O {Tybalt}, {Tybalt}, the best Friend I had:
1712   O curteous {Tybalt} honest Gentleman,
1713   That euer I should liue to see thee dead.
1714   <S {Iul}.> What storme is this that blowes so contrarie?
1715   Is {Romeo} slaughtred? and is {Tybalt} dead?
1716   My dearest Cozen, and my dearer Lord:
1717   Then dreadfull Trumpet sound the generall doome,
1718   For who is liuing, if those two are gone?
1719   <S {Nur}.> {Tybalt} is gone, and {Romeo} banished,
1720   {#Romeo} that kil'd him, he is banished.
1721   <S {Iul}.> O God!
1722   Did {Romeo's} hand shed {Tybalts} blood
1723   It did, it did, alas the day, it did.
1724   <S {Nur}.> O Serpent heart hid with a flowring face.
1725   <S {Iul}.> Did euer Dragon keepe so faire a Caue?
1726   Beautifull Tyrant, fiend Angelicall:
1727   Rauenous Doue- feather'd Rauen,
1728   Woluish- rauening Lambe,
1729   Dispised substance of Diuinest show:
1730   Iust opposite to what thou iustly seem'st,
1731   A dimne Saint, an Honourable Villaine:
1732   O Nature! what had'st thou to doe in #hell,
1733   When thou did'st bower the spirit of a fiend
1734   In mortall paradise of such sweet flesh?
1735   Was euer booke containing such vile matter
1736   So fairely bound? O that deceit should dwell
1737   In such a gorgeous Pallace.
1738   <S {Nur}.> There's no trust, no faith, no honestie in men,
1739   All periur'd, all forsworne, all naught, all dissemblers,
1740   Ah where's my man? giue me some Aqua- vitae?
1741   These griefes, these woes, these sorrowes make me old:
1742   Shame come to {Romeo}.
1743   <S {Iul}.> Blister'd be thy tongue
1744   For such a wish, he was not borne to shame:
1745   Vpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
1746   For 'tis a throane where Honour may be Crown'd
1747   Sole Monarch of the vniuersall earth:
1748   O what a beast was I to chide him?
1749   <S {Nur}.> Will you speake well of him,
1750   That kil'd your Cozen?
1751   <S {Iul}.> Shall I speake #ill of him that is my husband?
1752  *Ah poore my Lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
1753   When I thy three houres wife haue mangled it.
1754   But wherefore Villaine did'st thou kill my Cozin?
1755   That Villaine Cozin would haue kil'd my husband:
1756   Backe foolish teares, backe to your natiue spring,
1757   Your tributarie drops belong to woe,
1758   Which you mistaking offer vp to ioy:
1759   My husband liues that {Tibalt} would haue slaine,
1760   And {Tibalt} dead that would haue slaine my husband:
1761   All this is comfort, wherefore weepe I then?
1762   Some words there was worser then {Tybalts} death
1763   That murdered me, I would forget it feine,
1764   But oh, it presses to my memory,
1765   Like damned guilty deedes to sinners minds,
1766   {Tybalt} is dead and {Romeo} banished:
1767   That banished, that one word banished,
1768   Hath slaine ten thousand {Tibalts}: {Tibalts} death
1769   Was woe inough if it had ended there:
1770   Or if sower woe delights in fellowship,
1771   And needly will be rankt with other griefes,
1772   Why followed not when she said {Tibalt}s dead,
1773   Thy Father or thy Mother, nay or both,
1774   Which moderne lamentation might haue mou'd.
1775   But which a rere- ward following {Tybalts} death
1776   {#Romeo} is banished to speake that word,
1777   Is Father, Mother, {Tybalt}, {Romeo}, {Iuliet},
1778   All slaine, all dead: {Romeo} is banished,
1779   There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
1780   In that words death, no words can that woe sound.
1781   Where is my Father and my Mother Nurse?
1782   <S {Nur}.> Weeping and wailing ouer {Tybalts} Coarse,
1783   Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
1784  *<S {Iu}.> Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shal be spent
1785   When theirs are drie for {Romeo's} banishment.
1786   Take vp those Cordes, poore ropes you are beguil'd,
1787   Both you and I for {Romeo} is exild:
1788   He made you for a high- way to my bed,
1789   But I a Maid, die Maiden widowed.
1790   Come Cord, come Nurse, Ile to my wedding bed,
1791   And death not {Romeo}, take my Maiden head.
1792   <S {Nur}.> Hie to your Chamber, Ile find {Romeo}
1793   To comfort you, I wot well where he is:
1794   Harke ye your {Romeo} will be heere at night,
1795   Ile to him, he is hid at {Lawrence} Cell.
1796   <S {Iul}.> O find him, giue this Ring to my true Knight,
1797   And bid him come, to take his last farewell.
1798   <D {Exit}>
1799   <D {Enter Frier and Romeo}.>
1800   <S {Fri}.> {Romeo} come forth,
1801   Come forth thou fearfull man,
1802   Affliction is enamor'd of thy parts
1803   And thou art wedded to calamitie,
1804   <S {Rom}.> Father what newes?
      <P ff4>
1805   What is the Princes Doome?
1806   What sorrow craues acquaintance at my hand,
1807   That I yet know not?
1808   <S {Fri}.> Too familiar
1809   Is my deare Sonne with such sowre Company
1810   I bring thee tydings of the Princes Doome.
1811   <S {Rom}.> What lesse then Doomesday,
1812   Is the Princes Doome?
1813   <S {Fri}.> A gentler iudgement vanisht from his lips,
1814   Not bodies death, but bodies banishment.
1815   <S {Rom}.> Ha, banishment? be mercifull, say death:
1816   For exile hath more terror in his looke,
1817   Much more then death: do not say banishment.
1818   <S {Fri}.> Here from {Verona} art thou banished:
1819   Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
1820   <S {Rom}.> There is no world without {Verona} walles,
1821   But Purgatorie, Torture, #hell it selfe:
1822   Hence banished, is banisht from the world,
1823   And worlds exile is death. Then banished,
1824   Is death, mistearm'd, calling death banished,
1825   Thou cut'st my head off with a golden Axe,
1826   And smilest vpon the stroke that murders me.
1827   <S {Fri}.> O deadly sin, O rude vnthankefulnesse!
1828   Thy falt our Law calles death, but the kind Prince
1829   Taking thy part, hath rusht aside the Law,
1830   And turn'd that blacke word death, to banishment.
1831   This is deare mercy, and thou seest it not.
1832   <S {Rom}.> 'Tis Torture and not mercy, heauen is here
1833   Where {Iuliet} liues, and euery Cat and Dog,
1834   And little Mouse, euery vnworthy thing
1835   Liue here in Heauen and may looke on her,
1836   But {Romeo} may not. More Validitie,
1837   More Honourable state, more Courtship liues
1838   In carrion Flies, then {Romeo}: they may seaze
1839   On the white wonder of deare {Iuliets} hand,
1840   And steale immortall blessing from her lips,
1841   Who euen in pure and vestall modestie
1842   Still blush, as thinking their owne kisses sin.
1843   This may Flies doe, when I from this must flie,
1844   And saist thou yet, that exile is not death?
1845   But {Romeo} may not, hee is banished.
1846   Had'st thou no poyson mixt, no sharpe ground knife,
1847   No sudden meane of death, though nere so meane,
1848   But banished to kill me? Banished?
1849   O Frier, the damned vse that word in #hell:
1850   Howlings attends it, how hast then the hart
1851   Being a Diuine, a Ghostly Confessor,
1852   A Sin- Absoluer, and my Friend profest:
1853   To mangle me with that word, banished?
1854   <S {Fri}.> Then fond Mad man, heare me speake.
1855   <S {Rom}.> O thou wilt speake againe of banishment.
1856   <S {Fri}.> Ile giue thee Armour to keepe off that word,
1857   Aduersities sweete milke, Philosophie,
1858   To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
1859   <S {Rom}.> Yet banished? hang vp Philosophie:
1860   Vnlesse Philosophie can make a {Iuliet},
1861   Displant a Towne, reuerse a Princes Doome,
1862   It helpes not, it preuailes not, talke no more.
1863   <S {Fri}.> O then I see, that Mad men haue no eares.
1864   <S {Rom}.> How should they,
1865   When wisemen haue no eyes?
1866   <S {Fri}.> Let me dispaire with thee of thy estate,
1867   <S {Rom}.> Thou can'st not speake of that y dost not feele,
1868   Wert thou as young as {Iuliet} my Loue:
1869   An houre but married, {Tybalt} murdered,
1870   Doting like me, and like me banished,
1871   Then mightest thou speake,
1872   Then mightest thou teare thy hayre,
1873   And fall vpon the ground as I doe now,
1874   Taking the measure of an vnmade graue.
1875   <D {Enter Nurse, and knockes}.>
1876   <S {Frier}.> Arise one knockes,
1877   Good {Romeo} hide thy selfe.
1878   <S {Rom}.> Not I,
1879   Vnlesse the breath of Hartsicke groanes
1880   Mist- like infold me from the search of eyes.
1881   <D {Knocke}>
1882   <S {Fri}.> Harke how they knocke:
1883   (Who's there) {Romeo} arise,
1884   Thou wilt be taken, stay #a while, stand vp:
1885   <D {Knocke}.>
1886   Run to my study: #by and by, Gods #will
1887   What simplenesse is this: I come, I come.
1888   <D {Knocke}.>
1889   Who knocks so hard?
1890   Whence come you? what's your #will?
1891   <D {Enter Nurse}.>
1892   <S {Nur}.> Let me come in,
1893   And you shall know my errand:
1894   I come from Lady {Iuliet}.
1895   <S {Fri}.> Welcome then.
1896   <S {Nur}.> O holy Frier, O tell me holy Frier,
1897   Where's my Ladies Lord? where's {Romeo}?
1898   <S {Fri}.> There on the ground,
1899   With his owne teares made drunke.
1900   <S {Nur}.> O he is euen in my Mistresse case,
1901   Iust in her case. O wofull simpathy:
1902   Pittious predicament, euen so lies she,
1903   Blubbring and weeping, weeping and blubbring,
1904   Stand vp, stand vp, stand #and you be a man,
1905   For {Iuliets} sake, for her sake rise and stand:
1906   Why should you fall into so deepe an #O.
1907   <S {Rom}.> Nurse.
1908   <S {Nur}.> Ah sir, ah sir, deaths the end of all.
1909   <S {Rom}.> Speak'st thou of {Iuliet}? how is it with her?
1910   Doth not she thinke me an old Murtherer,
1911   Now I haue stain'd the Childhood of our ioy,
1912   With blood remoued, but little from her owne?
1913   Where is she? and how doth she? and what sayes
1914   My conceal'd Lady to our conceal'd Loue?
1915  *<S {Nur}.> Oh she sayes nothing sir, but weeps and weeps,
1916   And now fals on her bed, and then starts vp,
1917   And {Tybalt} calls, and then on {Romeo} cries,
1918   And then downe falls againe.
1919   <S {Ro}.> As if that name shot from the dead leuell of a Gun,
1920   Did murder her, as that names cursed hand
1921   Murdred her kinsman. Oh tell me Frier, tell me,
1922   In what vile part of this Anatomie
1923   Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sacke
1924   The hatefull Mansion.
1925   <S {Fri}.> Hold thy desperate hand:
1926   Art thou a man? thy forme cries out thou art:
1927   Thy teares are womanish, thy wild acts denote
1928   The vnreasonable Furie of a beast.
1929   Vnseemely woman, in a seeming man,
1930   And #ill beseeming beast in seeming both,
1931   Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
1932   I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
1933   Hast thou slaine {Tybalt}? wilt thou slay thy selfe?
1934   And slay thy Lady, that in thy life lies,
1935   By doing damned hate vpon thy selfe?
1936   Why rayl'st thou on thy birth? the heauen and earth?
      <P ff4v>
1937   Since birth, and heauen and earth, all three do meete
1938   In thee at once, which thou at once would'st loose.
1939   Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy loue, thy wit,
1940   Which like a Vsurer abound'st in all:
1941   And vsest none in that true vse indeed,
1942   Which should bedecke thy shape, thy loue, thy wit:
1943   Thy Noble shape, is but a forme of waxe,
1944   Digressing from the Valour of a man,
1945   Thy deare Loue sworne but hollow periurie,
1946   Killing that Loue which thou hast vow'd to cherish.
1947   Thy wit, that Ornament, to shape and Loue,
1948   Mishapen in the conduct of them both:
1949   Like powder in a skillesse Souldiers flaske,
1950   Is set #a fire by thine owne ignorance,
1951   And thou dismembred with thine owne defence.
1952   What, rowse thee man, thy {Iuliet} is aliue,
1953   For whose deare sake thou wast but lately dead.
1954   There art thou happy. {Tybalt} would kill thee,
1955   But thou slew'st {Tybalt}, there art thou happie.
1956   The law that threatned death became thy Friend.
1957   And turn'd it to exile, there art thou happy.
1958   A packe or blessing light vpon thy backe,
1959   Happinesse Courts thee in her best array,
1960   But like a mishaped and sullen wench,
1961   Thou puttest vp thy Fortune and thy Loue:
1962   Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
1963   Goe get thee to thy Loue as was decreed,
1964   Ascend her Chamber, hence and comfort her:
1965   But looke thou stay not till the watch be set,
1966   For then thou canst not passe to {Mantua},
1967   Where thou shalt liue till we can finde a time
1968   To blaze your marriage, reconcile your Friends,
1969   Beg pardon of thy Prince, and call thee backe,
1970   With twenty hundred thousand times more ioy
1971   Then thou went'st forth in lamentation.
1972   Goe before Nurse, commend me to thy Lady,
1973   And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
1974   Which heauy sorrow makes them apt vnto.
1975   {#Romeo} is comming.
1976   <S {Nur}.> O Lord, I could haue staid here all night,
1977   To heare good counsell: oh what learning is!
1978   My Lord Ile tell my Lady you will come.
1979   <S {Rom}.> Do so, and bid my Sweete prepare to chide.
1980   <S {Nur}.> Heere sir, a Ring she bid me giue you sir:
1981   Hie you, make #hast, for it growes very late.
1982   <S {Rom}.> How well my comfort is reuiu'd by this.
1983   <S {Fri}.> Go hence,
1984   Goodnight, and here stands all your state:
1985   Either be gone before the watch be set,
1986   Or by the breake of day disguis'd from hence,
1987   Soiourne in {Mantua}, Ile find out your man,
1988   And he shall signifie from time to time,
1989   Euery good hap to you, that chaunces heere:
1990   Giue me thy hand, 'tis late, farewell, goodnight.
1991   <S {Rom}.> But that a ioy past ioy, calls out on me,
1992   It were a griefe, so briefe to part with thee:
1993   Farewell. <D {Exeunt}.>
1994   <D {Enter old Capulet, his Wife and Paris}.>
1995   <S {Cap}.> Things haue falne out sir so vnluckily,
1996   That we haue had no time to moue our Daughter:
1997   Looke you, she Lou'd her kinsman {Tybalt} dearely,
1998   And so did I. Well, we were borne to die.
1999   'Tis very late, she'l not come downe to night:
2000   I promise you, but for your company,
2001   I would haue bin #a bed an houre ago.
2002   <S {Par}.> These times of wo, affoord no times to wooe:
2003   Madam goodnight, commend me to your Daughter.
2004   <S {Lady}.> I will, and know her mind early to morrow,
2005   To night, she is mewed vp to her heauinesse.
2006   <S {Cap}.> Sir {Paris}, I will make a desperate tender
2007   Of my Childes loue: I thinke she will be rul'd
2008   In all respects by me: nay more, I doubt it not.
2009   Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
2010   Acquaint her here, of my Sonne {Paris} Loue,
2011   And bid her, marke you me, on Wendsday next,
2012   But soft, what day is this?
2013   <S {Par}.> Monday my Lord.
2014   <S {Cap}.> Monday, ha ha: well Wendsday is too soone,
2015   #A Thursday let it be: #a Thursday tell her,
2016   She shall be married to this Noble Earle:
2017   Will you be ready? do you like this #hast?
2018   Weele keepe no great adoe, a Friend or two,
2019   For harke you, {Tybalt} being slaine so late,
2020   It may be thought we held him carelesly,
2021   Being our kinsman, if we reuell much:
2022   Therefore weele haue some halfe a dozen Friends,
2023   And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2024   <S {Paris}.> My Lord,
2025   I would that Thursday were to morrow.
2026   <S {Cap}.> Well, get you gone, #a Thursday, be it then:
2027   Go you to {Iuliet} ere you go to bed,
2028   Prepare her wife, against this wedding day.
2029   Farewell my Lord, light to my Chamber hoa,
2030  *Afore me, it is so late, that we may call it early #by and by,
2031   Goodnight. <D {Exeunt}.>
2032   <D {Enter Romeo and Iuliet aloft}.>
2033   <S {Iul}.> Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet neere day:
2034   It was the Nightingale, and not the Larke,
2035   That pier'st the fearefull hollow of thine eare,
2036   Nightly she sings on yond Pomgranet tree,
2037   Beleeue me Loue, it was the Nightingale.
2038   <S {Rom}.> It was the Larke the Herauld of the Morne:
2039   No Nightingale: looke Loue what enuious streakes
2040   Do lace the seuering Cloudes in yonder East:
2041   Nights Candles are burnt out, and Iocond day
2042   Stands tipto on the mistie Mountaines tops,
2043   I must be gone and liue, or stay and die.
2044   <S {Iul}.> Yond light is not daylight, I know it I:
2045   It is some Meteor that the Sun exhales,
2046   To be to thee this night a Torch- bearer,
2047   And light thee on thy way to {Mantua}.
2048   Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not be gone,
2049   <S {Rom}.> Let me be tane, let me be put to death,
2050   I am content, so thou wilt haue it so.
2051   Ile say yon gray is not the mornings eye,
2052   'Tis but the pale reflexe of {Cinthias} brow.
2053   Nor that is not Larke whose noates do beate
2054   The vaulty heauen so high aboue our heads,
2055   I haue more care to stay, then #will to go:
2056   Come death and welcome, {Iuliet} wills it so.
2057   How ist my soule, lets talke, it is not day.
2058   <S {Iuli}.> It is, it is, hie hence be gone away:
2059   It is the Larke that sings so out of tune,
2060   Straining harsh Discords, and vnpleasing Sharpes.
2061   Some say the Larke makes sweete Diuision;
2062   This doth not so: for she diuideth vs.
2063   Some say, the Larke and loathed Toad change eyes,
2064   O now I would they had chang'd voyces too:
      <P ff5>
2065   Since arme from arme that voyce doth vs affray,
2066   Hunting thee hence, with Hunts- vp to the day,
2067   O now be gone, more light and it light growes.
2068  *<S {Rom}.> More light &  light, more darke & darke our woes.
2069   <D {Enter Madam and Nurse}.>
2070   <S {Nur}.> Madam.
2071   <S {Iul}.> Nurse.
2072  *<S {Nur}.> Your Lady Mother is comming to your chamber,
2073   The day is broke, be wary, looke about.
2074   <S {Iul}.> Then window let day in, and let life out.
2075   <S {Rom}.> Farewell, farewell, one kisse and Ile descend.
2076  *<S {Iul}.> Art thou gone so? Loue, Lord, ay Husband, Friend,
2077   I must heare from thee euery day in the houre,
2078   For in a minute there are many dayes,
2079   O by this count I shall be much in yeares,
2080   Ere I againe behold my {Romeo}.
2081   <S {Rom}.> Farewell:
2082   I will omit no oportunitie,
2083   That may conuey my greetings Loue, to thee.
2084   <S {Iul}.> O thinkest thou we shall euer meet againe?
2085   <S {Rom}.> I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serue
2086   For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2087   <S {Iuliet}.> O God! I haue an #ill Diuining soule,
2088   Me thinkes I see thee now, thou art so lowe,
2089   As one dead in the bottome of a Tombe,
2090   Either my eye- sight failes, or thou look'st pale.
2091   <S {Rom}.> And trust me Loue, in my eye so do you:
2092   Drie sorrow drinkes our blood. Adue, adue. <D {Exit}.>
2093   <S {Iul}.> O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle,
2094   If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
2095   That is renown'd for faith? be fickle Fortune:
2096   For then I hope thou wilt not keepe him long,
2097   But send him backe.
2098   <D {Enter Mother}.>
2099   <S {Lad}.> Ho Daughter, are you vp?
2100   <S {Iul}.> Who ist that calls? Is it my Lady Mother.
2101   Is she not downe so late, or vp so early?
2102   What vnaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2103   <S {Lad}.> Why how now {Iuliet}?
2104   <S {Iul}.> Madam I am not well.
2105   <S {Lad}.> Euermore weeping for your Cozins death?
2106   What wilt thou wash him from his graue with teares?
2107   #And if thou could'st, thou could'st not make him liue:
2108   Therefore haue done, some griefe shewes much of Loue,
2109   But much of griefe, shewes still some want of wit.
2110   <S {Iul}.> Yet let me weepe, for such a feeling losse.
2111   <S {Lad}.> So shall you feele the losse, but not the Friend
2112   Which you weepe for.
2113   <S {Iul}.> Feeling so the losse,
2114   I cannot chuse but euer weepe the Friend.
2115  *<S {La}.> Well Girle, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2116   As that the Villaine liues which slaughter'd him.
2117   <S {Iul}.> What Villaine, Madam?
2118   <S {Lad}.> That same Villaine {Romeo}.
2119   <S {Iul}.> Villaine and he, be many miles assunder:
2120   God pardon, I doe with all my heart:
2121   And yet no man like he, doth grieue my heart.
2122   <S {Lad}.> That is because the Traitor liues.
2123   <S {Iul}.> #I Madam from the reach of these my hands:
2124   Would none but I might venge my Cozins death.
2125   <S {Lad}.> We will haue vengeance for it, feare thou not.
2126   Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in {Mantua},
2127   Where that same banisht Run- agate doth liue,
2128   Shall giue him such an vnaccustom'd dram,
2129   That he shall soone keepe {Tybalt} company:
2130   And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
2131   <S {Iul}.> Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied
2132   With {Romeo}, till I behold him. Dead
2133   Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext:
2134   Madam, if you could find out but a man
2135   To beare a poyson, I would temper it;
2136   That {Romeo} should vpon receit thereof,
2137   Soone sleepe in quiet. O how my heart abhors
2138   To heare him nam'd, and cannot come to him,
2139   To wreake the Loue I bore my Cozin,
2140   Vpon his body that hath slaughter'd him.
2141   <S {Mo}.> Find thou the meanes, and Ile find such a man.
2142   But now Ile tell thee ioyfull tidings Gyrle.
2143   <S {Iul}.> And ioy comes well, in such a needy time,
2144   What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
2145   <S {Mo}.> Well, well, thou hast a carefull Father Child?
2146   One who to put thee from thy heauinesse,
2147   Hath sorted out a sudden day of ioy,
2148   That thou expects not, nor I lookt not for.
2149   <S {Iul}.> Madam in happy time, what day is this?
2150   <S {Mo}.> Marry my Child, early next Thursday morne,
2151   The gallant, young, and Noble Gentleman,
2152   The Countie {Paris} at Saint {Peters} Church,
2153   Shall happily make thee a ioyfull Bride.
2154   <S {Iul}.> Now by Saint {Peters} Church, and {Peter} too,
2155   He shall not make me there a ioyfull Bride.
2156   I wonder at this #hast, that I must wed
2157   Ere he that should be Husband comes to woe:
2158   I pray you tell my Lord and Father Madam,
2159   I will not marrie yet, and when I doe, I sweare
2160   It shall be {Romeo}, whom you know I hate
2161   Rather then {Paris}. These are newes indeed.
2162   <S {Mo}.> Here comes your Father, tell him so your selfe,
2163   And see how he will take it at your hands.
2164   <D {Enter Capulet and Nurse}.>
2165   <S {Cap}.> When the Sun sets, the earth doth drizzle deaw
2166   But for the Sunset of my Brothers Sonne,
2167   It raines downright.
2168   How now? A Conduit Gyrle, what still in teares?
2169   Euermore showring in one little body?
2170   Thou counterfaits a Barke, a Sea, a Wind:
2171   For still thy eyes, which I may call the Sea,
2172   Do ebbe and flow with teares, the Barke thy body is
2173   Sayling in this salt floud, the windes thy sighes,
2174   Who raging with the teares and they with them,
2175   Without a sudden calme will ouer set
2176   Thy tempest tossed body. How now wife?
2177   Haue you deliuered to her our decree?
2178   <S {Lady}.> #I sir;
2179   But she will none, she giues you thankes,
2180   I would the foole were married to her graue.
2181   <S {Cap}.> Soft, take me with you, take me with you wife,
2182   How, will she none? doth she not giue vs thanks?
2183   Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2184   Vnworthy as she is, that we haue wrought
2185   So worthy a Gentleman, to be her Bridegroome
2186   <S {Iul}.> Not proud you haue,
2187   But thankfull that you haue:
2188   Proud can I neuer be of what I haue,
2189   But thankfull euen for hate, that is meant Loue.
2190   <S {Cap}.> How now?
2191   How now? Chopt Logicke? what is this?
2192   Proud, and I thanke you: and I thanke you not.
2193   Thanke me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
2194   But fettle your fine ioints 'gainst Thursday next,
      <P ff5v>
2195   To go with {Paris} to Saint {Peters} Church:
2196   Or I will drag thee, on a Hurdle thither.
2197   Out you greene sicknesse carrion, out you baggage,
2198   You tallow face.
2199   <S {Lady}.> Fie, fie, what are you mad?
2200   <S {Iul}.> Good Father, I beseech you on my knees
2201   Heare me with patience, but to speake a word.
2202   <S {Fa}.> Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch,
2203   I tell thee what, get thee to Church #a Thursday,
2204   Or neuer after looke me in the face.
2205   Speake not, reply not, do not answere me.
2206   My fingers itch, wife: we scarce thought vs blest,
2207   That God had lent vs but this onely Child,
2208   But now I see this one is one too much,
2209   And that we haue a curse in hauing her:
2210   Out on her Hilding.
2211   <S {Nur}.> God in heauen blesse her,
2212   You are #too blame my Lord to rate her so.
2213   <S {Fa}.> And why my Lady wisedome? hold your tongue,
2214   Good Prudence, smatter with your gossip, go.
2215   <S {Nur}.> I speak no treason,
2216   Father, O Godigoden,
2217   May not one speake?
2218   <S {Fa}.> Peace you mumbling foole,
2219   Vtter your grauitie ore a Gossips bowles
2220   For here we need it not.
2221   <S {La}.> You are too hot.
2222   <S {Fa}.> Gods bread, it makes me mad:
2223   Day, night, houre, ride, time, worke, play,
2224   Alone in companie, still my care hath bin
2225   To haue her matcht, and hauing now prouided
2226   A Gentleman of Noble Parentage,
2227   Of faire Demeanes, Youthfull, and Nobly Allied,
2228   Stuft as they say with Honourable parts,
2229   Proportion'd as ones thought would wish a man,
2230   And then to haue a wretched puling foole,
2231   A whining mammet, in her Fortunes tender,
2232   To answer, Ile not wed, I cannot Loue:
2233   I am too young, I pray you pardon me.
2234   But, #and you will not wed, Ile pardon you.
2235   Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
2236   Looke too't, thinke on't, I do not vse to iest.
2237   Thursday is neere, lay hand on heart, aduise,
2238   #And you be mine, Ile giue you to my Friend:
2239   #And you be not, hang, beg, starue, die in the streets,
2240   For by my soule, Ile nere acknowledge thee,
2241   Nor what is mine shall neuer do thee good:
2242   Trust too't, bethinke you, Ile not be forsworne <D {Exit}.>
2243   <S {Iuli}.> Is there no pittie sitting in the Cloudes,
2244   That sees into the bottome of my griefe?
2245   O sweet my Mother cast me not away,
2246   Delay this marriage, for a month, a weeke,
2247   Or if you do not, make the Bridall bed
2248   In that dim Monument where {Tybalt} lies.
2249   <S {Mo}.> Talke not to me, for Ile not speake a word,
2250   Do as thou wilt, for I haue done with thee. <D {Exit}.>
2251   <S {Iul}.> O God!
2252   O Nurse, how shall this be preuented?
2253   My Husband is on earth, my faith in heauen,
2254   How shall that faith returne againe to earth,
2255   Vnlesse that Husband send it me from heauen,
2256   By leauing earth? Comfort me, counsaile me:
2257   Alacke, alacke, that heauen should practise stratagems
2258   Vpon so soft a subiect as my selfe.
2259   What saist thou? hast thou not a word of ioy?
2260   Some comfort Nurse.
2261   <S {Nur}.> Faith here it is,
2262   {#Romeo} is banished, and all the world to nothing,
2263   That he dares nere come backe to challenge you:
2264   Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2265   Then since the case so stands as now it doth,
2266   I thinke it best you married with the Countie,
2267   O hee's a Louely Gentleman:
2268   {Romeo}s a dish- clout to him: an Eagle Madam
2269   Hath not so greene, so quicke, so faire an eye
2270   As {Paris} hath, beshrow my very heart,
2271   I thinke you are happy in this second match,
2272   For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2273   Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were,
2274   As liuing here and you no vse of him.
2275   <S {Iul}.> Speakest thou from thy heart?
2276   <S {Nur}.> And from my soule too,
2277   Or else beshrew them both.
2278   <S {Iul}.> Amen.
2279   <S {Nur}.> What?
2280   <S {Iul}.> Well, thou hast comforted me marue'lous much,
2281   Go in, and tell my Lady I am gone,
2282   Hauing displeas'd my Father, to {Lawrence} Cell,
2283   To make confession, and to be absolu'd.
2284   <S {Nur}.> Marrie I will, and this is wisely done.
2285   <S {Iul}.> Auncient damnation, O most wicked fiend!
2286   It is more sin to wish me thus forsworne,
2287   Or to dispraise my Lord with that same tongue
2288   Which she hath prais'd him with aboue compare,
2289   So many thousand times? Go Counsellor,
2290   Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twaine:
2291   Ile to the Frier to know his remedie,
2292   If all else faile, my selfe haue power to die. <D {Exeunt}.>
2293   <D {Enter Frier and Countie Paris}.>
2294   <S {Fri}.> On Thursday sir? the time is very short.
2295   <S {Par}.> My Father {Capulet} will haue it so,
2296   And I am nothing slow to slack his #hast.
2297   <S {Fri}.> You say you do not know the Ladies mind?
2298   Vneuen is the course, I like it not.
2299   <S {Pa}.> Immoderately she weepes for {Tybalts} death,
2300   And therfore haue I little talke of Loue,
2301   For {Venus} smiles not in a house of teares.
2302   Now sir, her Father counts it dangerous
2303   That she doth giue her sorrow so much sway:
2304   And in his wisedome, hasts our marriage,
2305   To stop the inundation of her teares,
2306   Which too much minded by her selfe alone,
2307   May be put from her by societie.
2308   Now doe you know the reason of this #hast?
2309   <S {Fri}.> I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
2310   Looke sir, here comes the Lady towards my Cell.
2311   <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
2312   <S {Par}.> Happily met, my Lady and my wife.
2313   <S {Iul}.> That may be sir, when I may be a wife.
2314   <S {Par}.> That may be, must be Loue, on Thursday next.
2315   <S {Iul}.> What must be shall be.
2316   <S {Fri}.> That's a certaine text.
2317   <S {Par}.> Come you to make confession to this Father?
2318   <S {Iul}.> To answere that, I should confesse to you.
2319   <S {Par}.> Do not denie to him, that you Loue me.
2320   <S {Iul}.> I will confesse to you that I Loue him.
2321   <S {Par}.> So will ye, I am sure that you Loue me.
2322   <S {Iul}.> If I do so, it will be of more price,
2323   Being spoke behind your backe, then to your face.
2324   <S {Par}.> Poore soule, thy face is much abus'd with teares.
      <P ff6>
2325   <S {Iul}.> The teares haue got small victorie by that:
2326   For it was bad inough before their spight.
2327  *<S {Pa}.> Thou wrong'st it more then teares with that report.
2328   <S {Iul}.> That is no slaunder sir, which is a truth,
2329   And what I spake, I spake it to thy face.
2330   <S {Par}.> Thy face is mine, and thou hast slaundred it.
2331   <S {Iul}.> It may be so, for it is not mine owne.
2332   Are you at leisure, Holy Father now,
2333   Or shall I come to you at euening Masse?
2334   <S {Fri}.> My leisure serues me pensiue daughter now.
2335   My Lord you must intreat the time alone.
2336   <S {Par}.> Godsheild: I should disturbe Deuotion,
2337   {#Iuliet}, on Thursday early will I rowse yee,
2338   Till then adue, and keepe this holy kisse. <D {Exit Paris}.>
2339   <S {Iul}.> O shut the doore, and when thou hast done so,
2340   Come weepe with me, past hope, past care, past helpe.
2341   <S {Fri}.> O {Iuliet}, I alreadie know thy griefe,
2342   It streames me past the compasse of my wits:
2343   I heare thou must and nothing may prorogue it,
2344   On Thursday next be married to this Countie.
2345   <S {Iul}.> Tell me not Frier that thou hearest of this,
2346   Vnlesse thou tell me how I may preuent it:
2347   If in thy wisedome, thou canst giue no helpe,
2348   Do thou but call my resolution wise,
2349   And with this knife, Ile helpe it presently.
2350   God ioyn'd my heart, and {Romeos}, thou our hands,
2351   And ere this hand by thee to {Romeo} seal'd:
2352   Shall be the Labell to another Deede,
2353   Or my true heart with trecherous reuolt,
2354   Turne to another, this shall slay them both:
2355   Therefore out of thy long experien'st time,
2356   Giue me some present counsell, or behold
2357   Twixt my extreames and me, this bloody knife
2358   Shall play the vmpeere, arbitrating that,
2359   Which the commission of thy yeares and #art,
2360   Could to no issue of true honour bring:
2361   Be not so long to speak, I long to die,
2362   If what thou speak'st, speake not of remedy.
2363   <S {Fri}.> Hold Daughter, I doe spie a kind of hope,
2364   Which craues as desperate an execution,
2365   As that is desperate which we would preuent.
2366   If rather then to marrie Countie {Paris}
2367   Thou hast the strength of #will to slay thy selfe,
2368   Then is it likely thou wilt vndertake
2369   A thing like death to chide away this shame,
2370   That coap'st with death himselfe, to scape fro it:
2371   And if thou dar'st, Ile giue thee remedie.
2372   <S {Iul}.> Oh bid me leape, rather then marrie {Paris},
2373   From #of the Battlements of any Tower,
2374   Or walke in theeuish waies, or bid me lurke
2375   Where Serpents are: chaine me with roaring Beares
2376   Or hide me nightly in a Charnell house,
2377   Orecouered quite with dead mens ratling bones,
2378   With reckie shankes and yellow chappels sculls:
2379   Or bid me go into a new made graue,
2380   And hide me with a dead man in his graue,
2381   Things that to heare them told, haue made me tremble,
2382   And I will doe it without feare or doubt,
2383   To liue an vnstained wife to my sweet Loue.
2384   <S {Fri}.> Hold then: goe home, be merrie, giue consent,
2385   To marrie {Paris}: wensday is to morrow,
2386   To morrow night looke that thou lie alone,
2387   Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy Chamber:
2388   Take thou this Violl being then in bed,
2389   And this distilling liquor drinke thou off,
2390   When presently through all thy veines shall run,
2391   A cold and drowsie humour: for no pulse
2392   Shall keepe his natiue progresse, but surcease:
2393   No warmth, no breath shall testifie thou liuest,
2394   The Roses in thy lips and cheekes shall fade
2395   To many ashes, the eyes windowes fall
2396   Like death when he shut vp the day of life:
2397   Each part depriu'd of supple gouernment,
2398   Shall stiffe and starke, and cold appeare like death,
2399   And in this borrowed likenesse of shrunke death
2400   Thou shalt continue two and forty houres,
2401   And then awake, as from a pleasant sleepe.
2402   Now when the Bridegroome in the morning comes,
2403   To rowse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
2404   Then as the manner of our country is,
2405   In thy best Robes vncouer'd on the Beere,
2406   Be borne to buriall in thy kindreds graue:
2407   Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault,
2408   Where all the kindred of the {Capulets} lie,
2409   In the meane time against thou shalt awake,
2410   Shall {Romeo} by my Letters know our drift,
2411   And hither shall he come, and that very night
2412   Shall {Romeo} beare thee hence to {Mantua}.
2413   And this shall free thee from this present shame,
2414   If no inconstant toy nor womanish feare,
2415   Abate thy valour in the acting it.
2416   <S {Iul}.> Giue me, giue me, O tell me not of care.
2417   <S {Fri}.> Hold get you gone, be strong and prosperous:
2418   In this resolue, Ile send a Frier with speed
2419   To {Mantua} with my Letters to thy Lord.
2420   <S {Iu}.> Loue giue me strength,
2421   And the strength shall helpe afford:
2422   Farewell deare father. <D {Exit}>
2423   <D {Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and}
2424   {Seruing men, two or three}.>
2425   <S {Cap}.> So many guests inuite as here are writ,
2426   Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning Cookes.
2427  *<S {Ser}.> You shall haue none #ill sir, for Ile trie if they can
2428   licke their fingers.
2429   <S {Cap}.> How canst thou trie them so?
2430  *<S {Ser}.> Marrie sir, 'tis an #ill Cooke that cannot licke his
2431  *owne fingers: therefore he that cannot licke his fingers
2432   goes not with me.
2433  *<S {Cap}.> Go be gone, we shall be much vnfurnisht for this
2434   time: what is my Daughter gone to Frier {Lawrence}?
2435   <S {Nur}.> #I forsooth.
2436   <S {Cap}.> Well he may chance to do some good on her,
2437   A peeuish selfe- wild harlotry it is.
2438   <D {Enter Iuliet}.>
2439   <S {Nur}.> See where she comes from shrift
2440   With merrie looke.
2441   <S {Cap}.> How now my headstrong,
2442   Where haue you bin gadding?
2443   <S {Iul}.> Where I haue learnt me to repent the sin
2444   Of disobedient opposition:
2445   To you and your behests, and am enioyn'd
2446   By holy {Lawrence}, to fall prostrate here,
2447   To beg your pardon: pardon I beseech you,
2448   Henceforward I am euer rul'd by you.
2449   <S {Cap}.> Send for the Countie, goe tell him of this,
2450   Ile haue this knot knit vp to morrow morning.
2451   <S {Iul}.> I met the youthfull Lord at {Lawrence} Cell,
2452   And gaue him what becomed Loue I might,
2453   Not stepping ore the bounds of modestie.
2454   <S {Cap}.> Why I am glad on't, this is well, stand vp,
      <P ff6v>
2455   This is as't should be, let me see the County:
2456   #I marrie go I say, and fetch him hither.
2457   Now afore God, this reueren'd holy Frier,
2458   All our whole Cittie is much bound to him.
2459   <S {Iul}.> Nurse will you goe with me into my Closet,
2460   To helpe me sort such needfull ornaments,
2461   As you thinke fit to furnish me to morrow?
2462   <S {Mo}.> No not till Thursday, there's time inough.
2463   <S {Fa}.> Go Nurse, go with her,
2464   Weele to Church to morrow.
2465   <D {Exeunt Iuliet and Nurse}.>
2466   <S {Mo}.> We shall be short in our prouision,
2467   'Tis now neere night.
2468   <S {Fa}.> Tush, I will stirre about,
2469   And all things shall be well, I warrant thee wife:
2470   Go thou to {Iuliet}, helpe to decke vp her,
2471   Ile not to bed to night, let me alone:
2472   Ile play the huswife for this once. What ho?
2473   They are all forth, well I will walke my selfe
2474   To Countie {Paris}, to prepare him vp
2475   Against to morrow, my heart is wondrous light,
2476   Since this same way- ward Gyrle is so reclaim'd.
2477   <D {Exeunt Father and Mother}.>
2478   <D {Enter Iuliet and Nurse}.>
2479   <S {Iul}.> #I those attires are best, but gentle Nurse
2480   I pray thee leaue me to my selfe to night:
2481   For I haue need of many Orysons,
2482   To moue the heauens to smile vpon my state,
2483   Which well thou know'st, is crosse and full of sin.
2484   <D {Enter Mother}.>
2485   <S {Mo}.> What are you busie ho? need you my help?
2486   <S {Iul}.> No Madam, we haue cul'd such necessaries
2487   As are behoouefull for our state to morrow:
2488   So please you, let me now be left alone;
2489   And let the Nurse this night sit vp with you,
2490   For I am sure, you haue your hands full all,
2491   In this so sudden businesse.
2492   <S {Mo}.> Goodnight.
2493   Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need. <D {Exeunt}.>
2494   <S {Iul}.> Farewell:
2495   God knowes when we shall meete againe.
2496   I haue a faint cold feare thrills through my veines,
2497   That almost freezes vp the heate of fire:
2498   Ile call them backe againe to comfort me.
2499   Nurse, what should she do here?
2500   My dismall Sceane, I needs must act alone:
2501   Come Viall, what if this mixture do not worke at all?
2502   Shall I be married then to morrow morning?
2503   No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there,
2504   What if it be a poyson which the Frier
2505   Subtilly hath ministred to haue me dead,
2506   Least in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
2507   Because he married me before to {Romeo}?
2508   I feare it is, and yet me thinkes it should not,
2509   For he hath still beene tried a holy man.
2510   How, if when I am laid into the Tombe,
2511   I wake before the time that {Romeo}
2512   Come to redeeme me? There's a fearefull point:
2513   Shall I not then be stifled in the Vault?
2514   To whose foule mouth no healthsome ayre breaths in,
2515   And there die strangled ere my {Romeo} comes.
2516   Or if I liue, is it not very like,
2517   The horrible conceit of death and night,
2518   Together with the terror of the place,
2519   As in a Vaulte, an ancient receptacle,
2520   Where for these many hundred yeeres the bones
2521   Of all my buried Auncestors are packt,
2522   Where bloody {Tybalt}, yet but greene in earth,
2523   Lies festring in his shrow'd, where as they say,
2524   At some houres in the night, Spirits resort:
2525   Alacke, alacke, is it not like that I
2526   So early waking, what with loathsome smels,
2527   And shrikes like Mandrakes torne out of the earth,
2528   That liuing mortalls hearing them, run mad.
2529   O if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2530   Inuironed with all these hidious feares,
2531   And madly play with my forefathers ioynts?
2532   And plucke the mangled {Tybalt} from his shrow'd?
2533   And in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone,
2534   As (with a club) dash out my desperate braines.
2535   O looke, me thinks I see my Cozins Ghost,
2536   Seeking out {Romeo} that did spit his body
2537   Vpon my Rapiers point: stay {Tybalt}, stay;
2538   {#Romeo}, {Romeo}, {Romeo}, here's drinke: I drinke to thee.
2539   <D {Enter Lady of the house, and Nurse}.>
2540   <S {Lady}.> Hold,
2541   Take these keies, and fetch more spices Nurse.
2542   <S {Nur}.> They call for Dates and Quinces in the Pastrie.
2543   <D {Enter old Capulet}.>
2544   <S {Cap}.> Come, stir, stir, stir,
2545   The second Cocke hath Crow'd,
2546   The Curphew Bell hath rung, 'tis three #a clocke:
2547   Looke to the bakte meates, good {Angelica},
2548   Spare not for cost.
2549   <S {Nur}.> Go you Cot- queane, go,
2550   Get you to bed, faith youle be sicke to morrow
2551   For this nights watching.
2552   <S {Cap}.> No not a whit: what? I haue watcht ere now
2553   All night for lesse cause, and nere beene sicke.
2554   <S {La}.> #I you haue bin a  Mouse- hunt in your time,
2555   But I will watch you from such watching now.
2556   <D {Exit Lady and Nurse}.>
2557   <S {Cap}.> A iealous hood, a iealous hood,
2558   Now fellow, what there?
2559   <D {Enter three or foure with spits, and logs, and baskets}.>
2560   <S {Fel}.> Things for the Cooke sir, but I know not what.
2561   <S {Cap}.> Make #hast, make #hast, sirrah, fetch drier Logs.
2562   Call {Peter}, he will shew thee where they are.
2563   <S {Fel}.> I haue a head sir, that will find out logs,
2564   And neuer trouble {Peter} for the matter.
2565   <S {Cap}.> Masse and well said, a merrie horson, ha,
2566   Thou shalt be loggerhead; good Father, 'tis day.
2567   <D {Play Musicke}>
2568   The Countie will be here with Musicke straight,
2569   For so he said he would, I heare him neere,
2570   Nurse, wife, what ho? what Nurse I say?
2571   <D {Enter Nurse}.>
2572   Go waken {Iuliet}, go and trim her vp,
2573   Ile go and chat with {Paris}: hie, make #hast,
2574   Make #hast, the Bridegroome, he is come already:
2575   Make #hast I say.
2576  *<S {Nur}.> Mistris, what Mistris? {Iuliet}? Fast I warrant her she.
2577   Why Lambe, why Lady? fie you sluggabed,
2578   Why Loue I say? Madam, sweet heart: why Bride?
2579   What not a word? You take your peniworths now.
2580   Sleepe for a weeke, for the next night I warrant
2581   The Countie {Paris} hath set vp his rest,
2582   That you shall rest but little, God forgiue me:
2583   Marrie and Amen: how sound is she #a sleepe?
      <P gg1>
2584   I must needs wake her: Madam, Madam, Madam,
2585   #I, let the Countie take you in your bed,
2586   Heele fright you vp yfaith. Will it not be?
2587   What drest, and in your clothes, and downe againe?
2588   I must needs wake you: Lady, Lady, Lady?
2589   Alas, alas, helpe, helpe, my Ladyes dead,
2590   Oh weladay, that euer I was borne,
2591   Some Aqua- vitae ho, my Lord, my Lady?
2592   <S {Mo}.> What noise is heere? <D {Enter Mother}.>
2593   <S {Nur}.> O lamentable day.
2594   <S {Mo}.> What is the matter?
2595   <S {Nur}.> Looke, looke, oh heauie day.
2596   <S {Mo}.> O me, O me, my Child, my onely life:
2597   Reuiue, looke vp, or I will die with thee:
2598   Helpe, helpe, call helpe.
2599   <D {Enter Father}.>
2600   <S {Fa}.> For shame bring {Iuliet} forth, her Lord is come.
2601  *<S {Nur}.> Shee's dead: deceast, shee's dead: alacke the day.
2602  *<S {M}.> Alacke the day, shee's dead, shee's dead, shee's dead.
2603   <S {Fa}.> Ha? Let me see her: out alas shee's cold,
2604   Her blood is setled and her ioynts are stiffe:
2605   Life and these lips haue long bene seperated:
2606   Death lies on her like an vntimely frost
2607   Vpon the swetest flower of all the field.
2608   <S {Nur}.> O Lamentable day!
2609   <S {Mo}.> O wofull time.
2610  *<S {Fa}.> Death that hath tane her hence to make me waile,
2611   Ties vp my tongue, and will not let me speake.
2612   <D {Enter Frier and the Countie}.>
2613   <S {Fri}.> Come, is the Bride ready to go to Church?
2614   <S {Fa}.> Ready to go, but neuer to returne.
2615   O Sonne, the night before thy wedding day,
2616   Hath death laine with thy wife: there she lies,
2617   Flower as she was, deflowred by him.
2618   Death is my Sonne in law, death is my Heire,
2619   My Daughter he hath wedded. I will die,
2620   And leaue him all life liuing, all is deaths.
2621   <S {Pa}.> Haue I thought long to see this mornings face,
2622   And doth it giue me such a sight as this?
2623   <S {Mo}.> Accur'st, vnhappie, wretched hatefull day,
2624   Most miserable houre, that ere time saw
2625   In lasting labour of his Pilgrimage.
2626   But one, poore one, one poore and louing Child,
2627   But one thing to reioyce and solace in,
2628   And cruell death hath catcht it from my sight.
2629   <S {Nur}.> O wo, O wofull, wofull, wofull day,
2630   Most lamentable day, most wofull day,
2631   That euer, euer, I did yet behold.
2632   O day, O day, O day, O hatefull day,
2633   Neuer was seene so blacke a day as this:
2634   O wofull day, O wofull day.
2635   <S {Pa}.> Beguild, diuorced, wronged, spighted, slaine,
2636   Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
2637   By cruell, cruell thee, quite ouerthrowne:
2638   O loue, O life; not life, but loue in death.
2639   <S {Fat}.> Despis'd, distressed, hated, martir'd, kil'd,
2640   Vncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
2641   To murther, murther our solemnitie?
2642   O Child, O Child; my soule, and not my Child,
2643   Dead art thou, alacke my Child is dead,
2644   And with my Child, my ioyes are buried.
2645   <S {Fri}.> Peace ho for shame, confusions: Care liues not
2646   In these confusions, heauen and your selfe
2647   Had part in this faire Maid, now heauen hath all,
2648   And all the better is it for the Maid:
2649   Your part in her, you could not keepe from death,
2650   But heauen keepes his part in eternall life:
2651   The most you sought was her promotion,
2652   For 'twas your heauen, she shouldst be aduan'st,
2653   And weepe ye now, seeing she is aduan'st
2654   Aboue the Cloudes, as high as Heauen it selfe?
2655   O in this loue, you loue your Child so #ill,
2656   That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
2657   Shee's not well married, that liues married long,
2658   But shee's best married, that dies married yong.
2659   Drie vp your teares, and sticke your Rosemarie
2660   On this faire Coarse, and as the custome is,
2661   And in her best array beare her to Church:
2662   For though some Nature bids all vs lament,
2663   Yet Natures teares are Reasons merriment.
2664   <S {Fa}.> All things that we ordained Festiuall,
2665   Turne from their office to blacke Funerall:
2666   Our instruments to melancholy Bells,
2667   Our wedding cheare, to a sad buriall Feast:
2668   Our solemne Hymnes, to sullen Dyrges change:
2669   Our Bridall flowers serue for a buried Coarse:
2670   And all things change them to the contrarie.
2671   <S {Fri}.> Sir go you in; and Madam, go with him,
2672   And go sir {Paris}, euery one prepare
2673   To follow this faire Coarse vnto her graue:
2674   The heauens do lowre vpon you, for some #ill:
2675  *Moue them no more, by crossing their high #will. <D {Exeunt}>
2676   <S {Mu}.> Faith we may put vp our Pipes and be gone.
2677   <S {Nur}.> Honest goodfellowes: Ah put vp, put vp,
2678   For well you know, this is a pitifull case.
2679   <S {Mu}.> #I by my troth, the case may be amended.
2680   <D {Enter Peter}.>
2681   <S {Pet}.> Musitions, oh Musitions,
2682   Hearts ease, hearts ease,
2683   O, #and you will haue me liue, play hearts ease.
2684   <S {Mu}.> Why hearts ease;
2685   <S {Pet}.> O Musitions,
2686   Because my heart it selfe plaies, my heart is full.
2687   <S {Mu}.> Not a dump we, 'tis no time to play now.
2688   <S {Pet}.> You will not then?
2689   <S {Mu}.> No.
2690   <S {Pet}.> I will then giue it you soundly.
2691   <S {Mu}.> What will you giue vs?
2692   <S {Pet}.> No money on my faith, but the gleeke.
2693   I will giue you the Minstrell.
2694   <S {Mu}.> Then will I giue you the Seruing creature.
2695  *<S {Peter}.> Then will I lay the seruing Creatures Dagger
2696  *on your pate. I will carie no Crochets, Ile Re you, Ile Fa
2697   you, do you note me?
2698   <S {Mu}.> #And you Re vs, and Fa vs, you Note vs.
2699   <S 2.{M}.> Pray you put vp your Dagger,
2700   And put out your wit.
2701   Then haue at you with my wit.
2702   <S {Peter}.> I will drie- beate you with an yron wit,
2703   And put vp my yron Dagger.
2704   Answere me like men:
2705  *When griping griefes the heart doth wound, then Mu-sicke
2706   with her siluer sound.
2707  *Why siluer sound? why Musicke with her siluer sound?
2708   what say you {Simon Catling}?
2709   <S {Mu}.> Mary sir, because siluer hath a sweet sound.
2710   <S {Pet}.> Pratest, what say you {Hugh Rebicke}?
2711  *<S 2.{M}.> I say siluer sound, because Musitions sound for sil-|(uer
2712   <S {Pet}.> Pratest #to, what say you {Iames Sound- Post}?
2713   <S 3.{Mu}.> Faith I know not what to say.
2714   <S {Pet}.> O I cry you mercy, you are the Singer.
2715   I will say for you; it is Musicke with her siluer sound,
      <P gg1v>
2716   Because Musitions haue no gold for sounding:
2717  *Then Musicke with her siluer sound, with speedy helpe
2718   doth lend redresse. <D {Exit}.>
2719   <S {Mu}.> What a pestilent knaue is this same?
2720  *<S {M}.2.> Hang him Iacke, come weele in here, tarrie for
2721   the Mourners, and stay dinner. <D {Exit}.>
2722   <D {Enter Romeo}.>
2723   <S {Rom}.> If I may trust the flattering truth of sleepe,
2724   My dreames presage some ioyfull newes at hand:
2725   My bosomes L[ord]. sits lightly in his throne:
2726   And all this day an vnaccustom'd spirit,
2727   Lifts me aboue the ground with cheerefull thoughts.
2728   I dreamt my Lady came and found me dead,
2729  *(Strange dreame that giues a dead man leaue to thinke,)
2730   And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
2731   That I reuiu'd and was an Emperour.
2732   Ah me, how sweet is loue it selfe possest,
2733   When  but loues shadowes are so rich in ioy.
2734   <D {Enter Romeo's man}.>
2735   Newes from {Verona}, how now {Balthazer}?
2736   Dost thou not bring me Letters from the Frier?
2737   How doth my Lady? Is my Father well?
2738   How doth my Lady {Iuliet}? that I aske againe,
2739   For nothing can be #ill, is she be well.
2740   <S {Man}.> Then she is well, and nothing can be #ill.
2741   Her body sleepes in {Capels} Monument,
2742   And her immortall part with Angels liue,
2743   I saw her laid low in her kindreds Vault,
2744   And presently tooke Poste to tell it you:
2745   O pardon me for bringing these #ill newes,
2746   Since you did leaue it for my office Sir.
2747   <S {Rom}.> Is it euen so?
2748   Then I denie you Starres.
2749   Thou knowest my lodging, get me inke and paper,
2750   And hire Post- Horses, I will hence to night.
2751   <S {Man}.> I do beseech you sir, haue patience:
2752   Your lookes are pale and wild, and do import
2753   Some misaduenture.
2754   <S {Rom}.> Tush, thou art deceiu'd,
2755   Leaue me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
2756   Hast thou no Letters to me from the Frier?
2757   <S {Man}.> No my good Lord.
2758   <D {Exit Man}.>
2759   <S {Rom}.> No matter: Get thee gone,
2760   And hyre those Horses, Ile be with thee straight,
2761   Well {Iuliet}, I will lie with thee to night:
2762   Lets see for meanes, O mischiefe thou art swift,
2763   To enter in the thoughts of desperate men:
2764   I do remember an Appothecarie,
2765   And here abouts dwells, which late I noted
2766   In tattred weeds, with ouerwhelming browes,
2767   Culling of Simples, meager were his lookes,
2768   Sharp miserie had worne him to the bones:
2769   And in his needie shop a Tortoyrs hung,
2770   An Allegater stuft, and other skins
2771   Of #ill shap'd fishes, and about his shelues,
2772   A beggerly account of emptie boxes ,
2773   Greene earthen pots, Bladders, and mustie seedes,
2774   Remnants of packthred, and old cakes of Roses
2775   Were thinly scattered, to make vp a shew.
2776   Noting this penury, to my selfe I said,
2777   #An if a man did need a poyson now,
2778   Whose sale is present death in {Mantua},
2779   Here liues a Caitiffe wretch would sell it him.
2780   O this same thought did but fore- run my need,
2781   And this same needie man must sell it me.
2782   As I remember, this should be the house,
2783   Being holy day, the beggers shop is shut.
2784   What ho? Appothecarie?
2785   <D {Enter Appothecarie}.>
2786   <S {App}.> Who call's so low'd?
2787   <S {Rom}.> Come hither man, I see that thou art poore,
2788   Hold, there is fortie Duckets, let me haue
2789   A dram of poyson, such soone speeding geare,
2790   As will disperse it selfe through all the veines,
2791   That the life- wearie- taker may fall dead,
2792   And that the Trunke may be discharg'd of breath,
2793   As violently, as hastie powder fier'd
2794   Doth hurry from the fatall Canons wombe.
2795   <S {App}.> Such mortall drugs I haue, but {Mantuas} law
2796   Is death to any #he, that vtters them.
2797   <S {Rom}.> Art thou so bare and full of wretchednesse,
2798   And fear'st to die? Famine is in thy cheekes,
2799   Need and opression starueth in thy eyes,
2800   Contempt and beggery hangs vpon thy backe:
2801   The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law:
2802   The world affords no law to make thee rich.
2803   Then be not poore, but breake it, and take this.
2804   <S {App}.> My pouerty, but not my #will consents.
2805   <S {Rom}.> I pray thy pouerty, and not thy #will.
2806   <S {App}.> Put this in any liquid thing you will
2807   And drinke it off, and if you had the strength
2808   Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
2809   <S {Rom}.> There's thy Gold,
2810   Worse poyson to mens soules,
2811   Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
2812   Then these poore compounds that thou maiest not sell.
2813   I sell thee poyson, thou hast sold me none,
2814   Farewell, buy food, and get thy selfe in flesh.
2815   Come Cordiall, and not poyson, go with me
2816   To {Iuliets} graue, for there must I vse thee.
2817   <D {Exeunt}.>
2818   <D {Enter Frier Iohn to Frier Lawrence}.>
2819   <S {Iohn}.> Holy {Franciscan} Frier, Brother, ho?
2820   <D {Enter Frier Lawrence}.>
2821   <S {Law}.> This same should be the voice of Frier {Iohn}.
2822   Welcome from {Mantua}, what sayes {Romeo}?
2823   Or if his mind be writ, giue me his Letter.
2824   <S {Iohn}.> Going to find a bare- foote Brother out,
2825   One of our order to associate me,
2826   Here in this Citie visiting the sick,
2827   And finding him, the Searchers of the Towne
2828   Suspecting that we both were in a house
2829   Where the infectious pestilence did raigne,
2830   Seal'd vp the doores, and would not let vs forth,
2831   So that my speed to {Mantua} there was staid.
2832   <S {Law}.> Who bare my Letter then to {Romeo}?
2833   <S {Iohn}.> I could not send it, here it is againe,
2834   Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
2835   So fearefull were they of infection.
2836   <S {Law}.> Vnhappie Fortune: by my Brotherhood
2837   The Letter was not nice; but full of charge,
2838   Of deare import; and the neglecting it
2839   May do much danger: Frier {Iohn} go hence,
2840   Get me an Iron Crow, and bring it straight
2841   Vnto my Cell.
2842   <S {Iohn}.> Brother Ile go and bring it thee. <D {Exit}.>
2843   <S {Law}.> Now must I to the Monument alone,
2844   Within this three houres will faire {Iuliet} wake,
2845   Shee will beshrew me much that {Romeo}
2846   Hath had no notice of these accidents:
2847   But I will write againe to {Mantua},
      <P gg2>
2848   And keepe her at my Cell till {Romeo} come,
2849   Poore liuing Coarse, clos'd in a dead mans Tombe,
2850   <D {Exit}.>
2851   <D {Enter Paris and his Page}.>
2852   <S {Par}.> Giue me thy Torch Boy, hence and stand aloft,
2853   Yet put it out, for I would not be seene:
2854   Vnder yond young Trees lay thee all along,
2855   Holding thy eare close to the hollow ground,
2856   So shall no foot vpon the Churchyard tread,
2857   Being loose, vnfirme with digging vp of Graues,
2858   But thou shalt heare it: whistle then to me,
2859   As signall that thou hearest some thing approach,
2860   Giue me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
2861   <S {Page}.> I am almost afraid to stand alone
2862   Here in the Churchyard, yet I will aduenture.
2863  *<S {Pa}.> Sweet Flower with flowers thy Bridall bed I strew:
2864   O woe, thy Canopie is dust and stones,
2865   Which with sweet water nightly I will dewe,
2866   Or wanting that, with teares destil'd by mones;
2867   The obsequies that I for thee will keepe,
2868   Nightly shall be, to strew thy graue, and weepe.
2869   <D {Whistle Boy}.>
2870   The Boy giues warning, something doth approach,
2871   What cursed foot wanders this wayes to night,
2872   To crosse my obsequies, and true loues right?
2873   What with a Torch? Muffle me night #a while.
2874   <D {Enter Romeo, and Peter}.>
2875  *<S {Rom}.> Giue me that Mattocke, & the wrenching Iron,
2876   Hold take this Letter, early in the morning
2877   See thou deliuer it to my Lord and Father,
2878   Giue me the light; vpon thy life I charge thee,
2879   What ere thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloofe,
2880   And do not interrupt me in my course.
2881   Why I descend into this bed of death,
2882   Is partly to behold my Ladies face:
2883   But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger,
2884   A precious Ring, a Ring that I must vse,
2885   In deare employment, therefore hence be gone:
2886   But if thou iealous dost returne to prie
2887   In what I further shall intend to do,
2888   By heauen I will teare thee ioynt by ioynt,
2889   And strew this hungry Churchyard with thy limbs:
2890   The time, and my intents are sauage wilde:
2891   More fierce and more inexorable farre,
2892   Them emptie Tygers, or the roaring Sea.
2893   <S {Pet}.> I will be gone sir, and not trouble you
2894  *<S {Ro}.> So shalt thou shew me friendship: take thou that,
2895   Liue and be prosperous, and farewell good fellow.
2896   <S {Pet}.> For all this same, Ile hide me here about,
2897   His lookes I feare, and his intents I doubt.
2898   <S {Rom}.> Thou detestable mawe, thou wombe of death,
2899   Gorg'd with the dearest morsell of the earth:
2900   Thus I enforce thy rotten Iawes to open,
2901   And in despight, Ile cram thee with more food.
2902   <S {Par}.> This is that banisht haughtie {Mountague},
2903   That murdred my Loues Cozin; with which griefe,
2904   It is supposed the faire Creature died,
2905   And here is come to do some villanous shame
2906   To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
2907   Stop thy vnhallowed toyle, vile {Mountague}:
2908   Can vengeance be pursued further then death?
2909   Condemned villaine, I do apprehend thee.
2910   Obey and go with me, for thou must die,
2911   <S {Rom}.> I must indeed, and therfore came I hither:
2912   Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man,
2913   Flie hence and leaue me, thinke vpon those gone,
2914   Let them affright thee. I beseech thee Youth,
2915   Put not an other sin vpon my head,
2916   By vrging me to furie. O be gone,
2917   By heauen I loue thee better then my selfe,
2918   For I come hither arm'd against my selfe:
2919   Stay not, be gone, liue, and hereafter say,
2920   A mad mans mercy bid thee run away.
2921   <S {Par}.> I do defie thy commisseration,
2922   And apprehend thee for a Fellon here.
2923  *<S {Ro}.> Wilt thou prouoke me? Then haue at thee Boy.
2924   <S {Pet}.> O Lord they fight, I will go call the Watch.
2925   <S {Pa}.> O I am slaine, if thou be mercifull,
2926   Open the Tombe, lay me with {Iuliet}.
2927   <S {Rom}.>  In faith I will, let me peruse this face:
2928   {Mercutius} kinsman, Noble Countie {Paris},
2929   What said my man, when my betossed soule
2930   Did not attend him as we rode? I thinke
2931   He told me {Paris} should haue married {Iuliet}.
2932   Said he not so? Or did I dreame it so?
2933   Or am I mad, hearing him talke of {Iuliet},
2934   To thinke it was so? O giue me thy hand,
2935   One, writ with me in sowre misfortunes booke.
2936   Ile burie thee in a triumphant graue.
2937   A Graue; O no, a Lanthorne; slaughtred Youth:
2938   For here lies {Iuliet}, and her beautie makes
2939   This Vault a feasting presence full of light.
2940   Death lie thou there, by a dead man inter'd,
2941   How oft when men are at the point of death,
2942   Haue they beene merrie? Which their Keepers call
2943   A lightning before death? Oh how may I
2944   Call this a lightning? O my Loue, my Wife,
2945   Death that hath suckt the honey of thy breath,
2946   Hath had no power yet vpon thy Beautie:
2947   Thou are not conquer'd: Beauties ensigne yet
2948   Is Crymson in thy lips, and in thy cheekes,
2949   And Deaths pale flag is not aduanced there.
2950   {Tybalt}, ly'st thou there in thy bloudy sheet?
2951   O what more fauour can I do to thee,
2952   Then with that hand that cut thy youth in twaine,
2953   To sunder his that was thy enemie?
2954   Forgiue me Cozen. Ah deare {Iuliet}:
2955   Why art thou yet so faire? I will beleeue,
2956   Shall I beleeue, that vnsubstantiall death is amorous?
2957   And that the leane abhorred Monster keepes
2958   Thee here in darke to be his Paramour?
2959   For feare of that, I still will stay with thee,
2960   And neuer from this Pallace of dym night
2961   Depart againe: come lie thou in my armes,
2962   Heere's to thy health, where ere thou tumblest in.
2963   O true Appothecarie!
2964   Thy drugs are quicke. Thus with a kisse I die.
2965   Depart againe; here, here will I remaine,
2966   With Wormes that are thy Chambermaides: O here
2967   Will I set vp my euerlasting rest:
2968   And shake the yoke of inauspicious starres
2969   From this world- wearied flesh: Eyes looke your last:
2970   Armes take your last embrace: And lips, O you
2971   The doores of breath, seale with a righteous kisse
2972   A datelesse bargaine to ingrossing death:
2973   Come bitter conduct, come vnsauory guide,
2974   Thou desperate Pilot, now at once run on
2975   The dashing Rocks, thy Sea- sicke wearie Barke:
2976   Heere's to my Loue. O true Appothecary:
      <P gg2v>
2977   Thy drugs are quicke. Thus with a kisse I die.
2978   <D {Enter Frier with a Lanthorne, Crow, and Spade}.>
2979   <S {Fri}.> St. Francis be my speed, how oft to night
2980   Haue my old feet stumbled at graues? Who's there?
2981  *<S {Man}.> Here's one, a Friend, & one that knowes you well.
2982   <S {Fri}.> Blisse be vpon you. Tell me good my Friend
2983   What Torch is yond that vainely lends his light
2984   To grubs, and eyelesse Sculles? As I discerne,
2985   It burneth in the {Capels} Monument.
2986   <S {Man}.> It doth so holy sir,
2987   And there's my Master, one that you loue.
2988   <S {Fri}.> Who is it?
2989   <S {Man}.> {Romeo}.
2990   <S {Fri}.> How long hath he bin there?
2991   <S {Man}.> Full halfe an houre.
2992   <S {Fri}.> Go with me to the Vault.
2993   <S {Man}.> I dare not Sir.
2994   My Master knowes not but I am gone hence,
2995   And fearefully did menace me with death,
2996   If I did stay to looke on his entents.
2997   <S {Fri}.> Stay, then Ile go alone, feares comes vpon me.
2998   O much I feare some #ill vnluckie thing.
2999   <S {Man}.> As I did sleepe vnder this young tree here,
3000   I dreamt my maister and another fought,
3001   And that my Maister slew him.
3002   <S {Fri}.> {Romeo}.
3003   Alacke, alacke, what blood is this which staines
3004   The stony entrance of this Sepulcher?
3005   What meane these Masterlesse, and goarie Swords
3006   To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
3007   {#Romeo}, oh pale: who else? what {Paris} too?
3008   And steept in blood? Ah what an vnkind houre
3009   Is guiltie of this lamentable chance?
3010   The Lady stirs.
3011   <S {Iul}.> O comfortable Frier, where's my Lord?
3012   I do remember well where I should be:
3013   And there I am, where is my {Romeo}?
3014   <S {Fri}.> I heare some noyse Lady, come from that nest
3015   Of death, contagion, and vnnaturall sleepe,
3016   A greater power then we can contradict
3017   Hath thwarted our entents, come, come away,
3018   Thy husband in thy bosome there lies dead:
3019   And {Paris} too: come Ile dispose of thee,
3020   Among a Sisterhood of holy Nunnes:
3021   Stay not to question, for the watch is comming.
3022   Come, go good {Iuliet}, I dare no longer stay. <D {Exit}.>
3023   <S {Iul}.> Go get thee hence, for I will not away,
3024   What's here, A cup clos'd in my true loues hand?
3025   Poyson I see hath bin his timelesse end
3026   O churle, drinke all? and left no friendly drop,
3027   To helpe me after, I will kisse thy lips,
3028   Happlie some poyson yet doth hang on them,
3029   To make me die with a restoratiue.
3030   Thy lips are warme.
3031   <D {Enter Boy and Watch}.>
3032   <S {Watch}.> Lead Boy, which way?
3033   <S {Iul}.> Yea noise?
3034   Then ile be briefe. O happy Dagger.
3035   'Tis in thy sheath, there rust and let me die. <D {Kils herselfe}.>
3036   <S {Boy}.> This is the place,
3037   There where the Torch doth burne
3038   <S {Watch}.> The ground is bloody,
3039   Search about the Churchyard.
3040   Go some of you, who ere you find attach.
3041   Pittifull sight, here lies the Countie slaine,
3042   And {Iuliet} bleeding, warme and newly dead
3043   Who here hath laine these two dayes buried.
3044   Go tell the Prince, runne to the {Capulets},
3045   Raise vp the {Mountagues}, some others search,
3046   We see the ground whereon these woes do lye,
3047   But the true ground of all these piteous woes,
3048   We cannot without circumstance descry.
3049   <D {Enter Romeo's man}.>
3050   <S {Watch}.> Here's {Romeo's} man,
3051   We found him in the Churchyard.
3052  *<S {Con}.> Hold him in safety, till the Prince come hither.
3053   <D {Enter Frier, and another Watchman}.>
3054  *<S 3.{Wat}.> Here is a Frier that trembles, sighes, and weepes
3055   We tooke this Mattocke and this Spade from him,
3056   As he was comming from this Church- yard side.
3057   <S {Con}.> A great suspition, stay the Frier too.
3058   <D {Enter the Prince}.>
3059   <S {Prin}.> What misaduenture is so earely vp,
3060   That calls our person from our mornings rest?
3061   <D {Enter Capulet and his Wife}.>
3062   <S {Cap}.> What should it be that they so shrike abroad?
3063   <S {Wife}.> O the people in the streete crie {Romeo}.
3064   Some {Iuliet}, and some {Paris}, and all runne
3065   With open outcry toward our Monument.
3066   <S {Pri}.> What feare is this which startles in your eares?
3067   <S {Wat}.> Soueraigne, here lies the Countie {Paris} slaine,
3068   And {Romeo} dead, and {Iuliet} dead before,
3069   Warme and new kil'd.
3070   <S {Prin}.> Search,
3071   Seeke, and know how, this foule murder comes.
3072   <S {Wat}.> Here is a Frier, and Slaughter'd {Romeos} man,
3073   With Instruments vpon them fit to open
3074   These dead mens Tombes.
3075   <S {Cap}.> O heauen!
3076   O wife looke how our Daughter bleedes!
3077   This Dagger hath mistaine, for loe his house
3078   Is empty on the backe of {Mountague},
3079   And is misheathed in my Daughters bosome.
3080   <S {Wife}.> O me, this sight of death, is as a Bell
3081   That warnes my old age to a Sepulcher.
3082   <D {Enter Mountague}.>
3083   <S {Pri}.> Come {Mountague}, for thou art early vp
3084   To see thy Sonne and Heire, now early downe.
3085   <S {Moun}.> Alas my liege, my wife is dead to night,
3086   Griefe of my Sonnes exile hath stopt her breath:
3087   What further woe conspires against my age?
3088   <S {Prin}.> Looke: and thou shalt see.
3089   <S {Moun}.> O thou vntaught, what manners is in this,
3090   To presse before thy Father to a graue?
3091   <S {Prin}.> Seale vp the mouth of outrage for #a while,
3092   Till we can cleare these ambiguities,
3093   And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
3094   And then I will be generall of your woes,
3095   And lead you euen to death? meane time forbeare,
3096   And let mischance be slaue to patience,
3097   Bring forth the parties of suspition.
3098   <S {Fri}.> I am the greatest, able to doe least,
3099   Yet most suspected as the time and place
3100   Doth make against me of this direfull murther:
3101   And heere I stand both to impeach and purge
3102   My selfe condemned, and my selfe excus'd.
3103  *<S {Prin}.> Then say at once, what thou dost know in this?
3104   <S {Fri}.> I will be briefe, for my short date of breath
3105   Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
3106   {#Romeo} there dead, was husband to that {Iuliet},
3107   And she there dead, that's {Romeos} faithfull wife:
      <P Gg1><C B>
3108   I married them; and their stolne marriage day
3109   Was {Tybalts} Doomesday: whose vntimely death
3110   Banish'd the new- made Bridegroome from this Citie:
3111   For whom (and not for {Tybalt}) {Iuliet} pinde.
3112   You, to remoue that siege of Greefe from her,
3113   Betroth'd, and would haue married her perforce
3114   To Countie {Paris}. Then comes she to me,
3115   And (with wilde lookes) bid me deuise some meanes
3116   To rid her from this second Marriage,
3117   Or in my Cell there would she kill her selfe.
3118   Then gaue I her (so Tutor'd by my Art)
3119   A sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect
3120   As I intended, for it wrought on her
3121   The forme of death. Meane time, I writ to {Romeo},
3122   That he should hither come, as this dyre night,
3123   To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,
3124   Being the time the Potions force should cease.
3125   But he which bore my Letter, Frier {Iohn},
3126   Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
3127   Return'd my Letter backe. Then all alone,
3128   At the prefixed houre of her waking,
3129   Came I to take her from her Kindreds vault,
3130   Meaning to keepe her closely at my Cell,
3131   Till I conueniently could send to {Romeo}.
3132   But when I came (some Minute ere the time
3133   Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay
3134   The Noble {Paris}, and true {Romeo} dead.
3135   Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,
3136   And beare this worke  of Heauen, with patience:
3137   But then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe,
3138   And she (too desperate) would not go with me,
3139   But (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe.
3140   All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nurse is priuy:
3141   And if ought in this miscarried by my fault,
3142  *Let my old life be sacrific'd, some houre before the time,
3143   Vnto the rigour of seuerest Law.
3144   <S {Prin}.> We still haue knowne thee for a Holy man.
3145   Where's {Romeo's} man? What can he say to this?
3146   <S {Boy}.> I brought my Master newes of {Iuliets} death,
3147   And then in poste he came from {Mantua}
3148   To this same place, to this same Monument.
3149   This Letter he early bid me giue his Father,
3150   And threatned me with death, going in the Vault,
3151   If I departed not, and left him there.
3152   <S {Prin}.> Giue me the Letter, I will look on it.
3153   Where is the Counties Page that rais'd the Watch?
3154   Sirra, what made your Master in this place?
3155  *<S {Page}.> He came with flowres to strew his Ladies graue,
3156   And bid me stand aloofe, and so I did:
3157   Anon comes one with light to ope the Tombe,
3158   And #by and by my Maister drew on him,
3159   And then I ran away to call the Watch.
3160  *<S {Prin}.> This Letter doth make good the Friers words,
3161   Their course of Loue, the tydings of her death:
3162   And heere he writes, that he did buy a poyson
3163   Of a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall
3164   Came to this Vault to dye, and lye with {Iuliet}.
3165   Where be these Enemies? {Capulet}, {Mountague},
3166   See what a scourge is laide vpon your hate,
3167  *That Heauen finds meanes to kill your ioyes with Loue;
3168   And I, for winking at your discords too,
3169   Haue lost a brace of Kinsmen: All are punish'd.
3170   <S {Cap}.> O Brother {Mountague}, giue me thy hand,
3171   This is my Daughters ioynture, for no more
3172   Can I demand.
3173   <S {Moun}.> But I can giue thee more:
3174   For I will raise her Statue in pure Gold,
3175   That whiles {Verona} by that name is knowne,
3176   There shall no figure at that Rate be set,
3177   As that of True and Faithfull {Iuliet}.
3178   <S {Cap}.> As rich shall {Romeo} by his Lady ly,
3179   Poore sacrifices of our enmity.
3180  *<S {Prin}.> A glooming peace this morning with it brings,
3181   The Sunne for sorrow will not shew his head;
3182   Go hence, to haue more talke of these sad things,
3183   Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished.
3184   For neuer was a Storie of more Wo,
3185   Then this of {Iuliet}, and her {Romeo}. <D {Exeunt omnes}>
3186   <Z FINIS.
