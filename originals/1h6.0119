6      the Bishop of Winchester, and}

8      <S {Bedford}.>
9     *Hung be y heauens with black, yield day to night;
10    *Comets importing change of Times and States,
11     Brandish your crystall Tresses in the Skie,
12    *And with them scourge the bad reuolting Stars,
13     That haue consented vnto {Henries} death:
14     King {Henry} the Fift, too famous to liue long,
15     England ne're lost a King of so much worth.
16     <S {Glost}.> England ne're had a King vntill his time:
17     Vertue he had, deseruing to command,
18     His brandisht Sword did blinde men with his beames,
19     His Armes spred wider then a Dragons Wings:
20     His sparkling Eyes, repleat with wrathfull fire,
21     More dazled and droue back his Enemies,
22     Then mid- day Sunne, fierce bent against their faces.
23     What should I say? his Deeds exceed all speech:
24     He ne're lift vp his Hand, but conquered.
25    *<S {Exe}.> We mourne in black, why mourn we not in blood?
26     {Henry} is dead, and neuer shall reuiue:
27     Vpon a Woodden Coffin we attend;
28     And Deaths dishonourable Victorie,
29     We with our stately presence glorifie,
30     Like Captiues bound to a Triumphant Carre.
31     What? shall we curse the Planets of Mishap,
32     That plotted thus our Glories ouerthrow?
33     Or shall we thinke the subtile- witted French,
34     Coniurers and Sorcerers, that afraid of him,
35     By Magick Verses haue contriu'd his end.
36     <S {Winch}.> He was a King, blest of the King of Kings.
37     Vnto the French, the dreadfull Iudgement- Day
38     So dreadfull will not be, as was his sight.
39     The Battailes of the Lord of Hosts he fought:
40     The Churches Prayers made him so prosperous.
41     <S {Glost}.> The Church? where is it?
42     Had not Church- men pray'd,
43     His thred of Life had not so soone decay'd.
44     None doe you like, but an effeminate Prince,
45     Whom like a Schoole- boy you may ouer- awe.
46     <S {Winch}.> {Gloster}, what ere we like, thou art Protector,
47     And lookest to command the Prince and Realme.
48     Thy Wife is prowd, she holdeth thee in awe,
49     More then God or Religious Church- men may.
50     <S {Glost}.> Name not Religion, for thou lou'st the Flesh,
51     And ne're throughout the yeere to Church thou go'st,
52     Except it be to pray against thy foes.
53    *<S {Bed}.> Cease, cease these Iarres, & rest your minds in peace:
54     Let's to the Altar: Heralds wayt on vs;
55     In stead of Gold, wee'le offer vp our Armes,
56     Since Armes auayle not, now that {Henry}'s dead,
57     Posteritie await for wretched yeeres,
58    *When at their Mothers moistned eyes, Babes shall suck,
59     Our #Ile be made a Nourish of salt Teares,
60     And none but Women left to wayle the dead.
61     {Henry} the Fift, thy Ghost I inuocate:
62     Prosper this Realme, keepe it from Ciuill Broyles,
63     Combat with aduerse Planets in the Heauens;
64     A farre more glorious Starre thy Soule will make,
65     Then {Iulius Caesar}, or bright===
66     <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
67     <S {Mess}.> My honourable Lords, health to you all:
68     Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
69     Of losse, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
70     Guyen, Champaigne, Rheimes, Orleance,
71     Paris Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
72    *<S {Bedf}.> What say'st thou man, before dead {Henry's} Coarse?
73     Speake softly, or the losse of those great Townes
74     Will make him burst his Lead, and rise from death.
75     <S {Glost}.> Is Paris lost? is Roan yeelded vp?
76     If {Henry} were recall'd to life againe,
77    *These news would cause him once more yeeld the Ghost.
78     <S {Exe}.> How were they lost? what trecherie was vs'd?
79     <S {Mess}.> No trecherie, but want of Men and Money.
80     Amongst the Souldiers this is muttered,
81     That here you maintaine seuerall Factions:
82     And whil'st a Field should be dispatcht and fought,
83     You are disputing of your Generals.
84     One would haue lingring Warres, with little cost;
85     Another would flye swift, but wanteth Wings:
86     A third thinkes, without expence at all,
87     By guilefull faire words, Peace may be obtayn'd.
88     Awake, awake, English Nobilitie,
89     Let not slouth dimme your Honors, new begot;
90     Cropt are the Flower- de- Luces in your Armes
91     Of Englands Coat, one halfe is cut away.
92     <S {Exe}.> Were our Teares wanting to this Funerall,
93     These Tidings would call forth her flowing Tides.
94     <S {Bedf}.> Me they concerne, Regent I am of France:
95     Giue me my steeled Coat, Ile fight for France.
96     Away with these disgracefull wayling Robes;
97     Wounds will I lend the French, in stead of Eyes,
98     To weepe their intermissiue Miseries.
      <P k3>
99     <D {Enter to them another Messenger}.>
100   *<S {Mess}.> Lords view these Letters, full of bad mischance.
101    France is reuolted from the English quite,
102    Except some petty Townes, of no import.
103    The Dolphin {Charles} is crowned King in Rheimes:
104    The Bastard of Orleance with him is ioyn'd:
105    {Reynold}, Duke of Aniou, doth take his part,
106    The Duke of Alanson flyeth to his side.  <D {Exit}.>
107    <S {Exe}.> The Dolphin crown'd King? all flye to him?
108    O whither shall we flye from this reproach?
109    <S {Glost}.> We will not flye, but to our enemies throats.
110    {#Bedford}, if thou be slacke, Ile fight it out.
111    <S {Bed}.> {Gloster}, why doubtst thou of my forwardnesse?
112    An Army haue I muster'd in my thoughts,
113    Wherewith already France is ouer- run.
114    <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
115    <S {Mes}.> My gracious Lords, to adde to your laments,
116    Wherewith you now bedew King {Henries} hearse,
117    I must informe you of a dismall fight,
118    Betwixt the stout Lord {Talbot}, and the French.
119    <S {Win}.> What? wherein {Talbot} ouercame, is't so?
120   *<S 3.{Mes}.> O no: wherein Lord {Talbot} was o'rethrown:
121    The circumstance Ile tell you more at large.
122    The tenth of August last, this dreadfull Lord,
123    Retyring from the Siege of Orleance,
124    Hauing full scarce six thousand in his troupe,
125    By three and twentie thousand of the French
126    Was round incompassed, and set vpon:
127    No leysure had he to enranke his men.
128    He wanted Pikes to set before his Archers:
129    In stead whereof, sharpe Stakes pluckt out of Hedges
130    They pitched in the ground confusedly,
131    To keepe the Horsemen off, from breaking in.
132    More then three houres the fight continued:
133    Where valiant {Talbot}, aboue humane thought,
134    Enacted wonders with his Sword and Lance.
135    Hundreds he sent to #Hell, and none durst stand him:
136    Here, there, and euery where enrag'd, he slew.
137    The French exclaym'd, the Deuill was in Armes,
138    All the whole Army stood agaz'd on him.
139    His Souldiers spying his vndaunted Spirit,
140    A {Talbot}, a {Talbot}, cry'd out amaine,
141    And rusht into the Bowels of the Battaile.
142    Here had the Conquest fully been seal'd vp,
143    If Sir {Iohn Falstaffe} had not play'd the Coward.
144    He being in the Vauward, plac't behinde,
145    With purpose to relieue and follow them,
146    Cowardly fled, not hauing struck one stroake.
147    Hence grew the generall wrack and massacre:
148    Enclosed were they with their Enemies.
149    A base Wallon, to win the Dolphins grace,
150    Thrust {Talbot} with a Speare into the Back,
151    Whom all France, with their chiefe assembled strength,
152    Durst not presume to looke once in the face.
153    <S {Bedf}.> Is {Talbot} slaine then? I will slay my selfe,
154    For liuing idly here, in pompe and ease,
155    Whil'st such a worthy Leader, wanting ayd,
156    Vnto his dastard foe- men is betray'd.
157    <S 3.{Mess}.> O no, he liues, but is tooke Prisoner,
158    And Lord {Scales} with him, and Lord {Hungerford}:
159    Most of the rest slaughter'd, or tooke likewise.
160    <S {Bedf}.> His Ransome there is none but I shall pay.
161    Ile hale the Dolphin headlong from his Throne,
162    His Crowne shall be the Ransome of my friend:
163    Foure of their Lords Ile change for one of ours.
164    Farwell my Masters, to my Taske will I,
165    Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
166    To keepe our great Saint {Georges} Feast withall.
167    Ten thousand Souldiers with me I will take,
168    Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
169    <S 3.{Mess}.> So you had need, for Orleance is besieg'd,
170    The English Army is growne weake and faint:
171    The Earle of Salisbury craueth supply,
172    And hardly keepes his men from mutinie,
173    Since they so few, watch such a multitude.
174   *<S {Exe}.> Remember Lords your Oathes to {Henry} sworne:
175    Eyther to quell the Dolphin vtterly,
176    Or bring him in obedience to your yoake.
177    <S {Bedf}.> I doe remember it, and here take my leaue,
178    To goe about my preparation.  <D {Exit Bedford}.>
179    <S {Glost}.> Ile to the Tower with all the #hast I can,
180    To view th' Artillerie and Munition,
181    And then I will proclayme young {Henry} King.
182    <D {Exit Gloster}.>
183    <S {Exe}.> To Eltam will I, where the young King is,
184    Being ordayn'd his speciall Gouernor,
185    And for his safetie there Ile best deuise.  <D {Exit}.>
186    <S {Winch}.> Each hath his Place and Function to attend:
187    I am left out; for me nothing remaines:
188    But long I will not be Iack out of Office.
189    The King from Eltam I intend to send,
190    And sit at chiefest Sterne of publique Weale.
191    <D {Exit}.>
192    <D {Sound a Flourish}.>
193    <D {Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reigneir, marching}
194    {with Drum and Souldiers}.>
195   *<S {Charles}.> {Mars} his true mouing, euen as in the Heauens,
196    So in the Earth, to this day is not knowne.
197    Late did he shine vpon the English side:
198    Now we are Victors, vpon vs he smiles.
199    What Townes of any moment, but we haue?
200    At pleasure here we lye, neere Orleance:
201    Otherwhiles, the famisht English, like pale Ghosts,
202    Faintly besiege vs one houre in a moneth.
203   *<S {Alan}.> They want their Porredge, & their fat Bul Beeues:
204    Eyther they must be dyeted like Mules,
205    And haue their Prouender ty'd to their mouthes,
206    Or pitteous they will looke, like drowned Mice.
207    <S {Reigneir}.> Let's rayse the Siege: why liue we idly here?
208    {#Talbot} is taken, whom we wont to feare:
209    Remayneth none but mad- brayn'd {Salisbury},
210    And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
211    Nor men nor Money hath he to make Warre.
212    <S {Charles}.> Sound, sound Alarum, we will rush on them.
213    Now for the honour of the forlorne French:
214    Him I forgiue my death, that killeth me,
215    When he sees me goe back one foot, or flye.  <D {Exeunt}.>
216    <D {Here Alarum, they are beaten back by the}
217    {English, with great losse}.>
218    <D {Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reigneir}.>
219    <S {Charles}.> Who euer saw the like? what men haue I?
220    Dogges, Cowards, Dastards: I would ne're haue fled,
221    But that they left me 'midst my Enemies.
222    <S {Reigneir}.> {Salisbury} is a desperate Homicide,
223    He fighteth as one weary of his life:
224    The other Lords, like Lyons wanting foode,
225    Doe rush vpon vs as their hungry prey.
      <P k3v>
226    <S {Alanson}.> {Froysard}, a Countreyman of ours, records,
227    England all {Oliuers} and {Rowlands} breed,
228    During the time {Edward} the third did raigne:
229    More truly now may this be verified;
230    For none but {Samsons} and {Goliasses}
231    It sendeth forth to skirmish: one to tenne?
232    Leane raw- bon'd Rascals, who would e'er suppose,
233    They had such courage and audacitie?
234    <S {Charles}.> Let's leaue this Towne,
235    For they are hayre- brayn'd Slaues,
236    And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
237    Of old I know them; rather with their Teeth
238    The Walls they'le teare downe, then forsake the Siege.
239    <S {Reigneir}.> I thinke by some odde Gimmors or Deuice
240    Their Armes are set, like Clocks, still to strike on;
241    Else ne're could they hold out so as they doe:
242    By my consent, wee'le euen let them alone.
243    <S {Alanson}.> Be it so.
244    <D {Enter the Bastard of Orleance}.>
245   *<S {Bastard}.> Where's the Prince Dolphin? I haue newes
246    for him.
247    <S {Dolph}.> Bastard of Orleance, thrice welcome to vs.
248   *<S {Bast}.> Me thinks your looks are sad, your chear appal'd.
249    Hath the late ouerthrow wrought this offence?
250    Be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand:
251    A holy Maid hither with me I bring,
252    Which by a Vision sent to her from Heauen,
253    Ordayned is to rayse this tedious Siege,
254    And driue the English forth the bounds of France:
255    The spirit of deepe Prophecie she hath,
256    Exceeding the nine {Sibyls} of old Rome:
257    What's past, and what's to come, she can descry.
258    Speake, shall I call her in? beleeue my words,
259    For they are certaine, and vnfallible.
260    <S {Dolph}.> Goe call her in: but first, to try her skill,
261    {Reignier} stand thou as Dolphin in my place;
262    Question her prowdly, let thy Lookes be sterne,
263    By this meanes shall we sound what skill she hath.
264    <D {Enter Ioane Puzel}.>
265   *<S {Reigneir}.> Faire Maid, is't thou wilt doe these won-drous
266    feats?
267   *<S {Puzel}.> {Reignier}, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
268    Where is the Dolphin? Come, come from behinde,
269    I know thee well, though neuer seene before.
270    Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me;
271    In priuate will I talke with thee apart:
272    Stand back you Lords, and giue vs leaue #a while.
273    <S {Reigneir}.> She takes vpon her brauely at first dash.
274   *<S {Puzel}.> Dolphin, I am by birth a Shepheards Daughter,
275    My wit vntrayn'd in any kind of #Art:
276    Heauen and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
277    To shine on my contemptible estate.
278    Loe, whilest I wayted on my tender Lambes,
279    And to Sunnes parching heat display'd my cheekes,
280    Gods Mother deigned to appeare to me,
281    And in a Vision full of Maiestie,
282    Will'd me to leaue my base Vocation,
283    And free my Countrey from Calamitie:
284    Her ayde she promis'd, and assur'd successe.
285    In compleat Glory shee reueal'd her selfe:
286    And whereas I was black and swart before,
287    With those cleare Rayes, which shee infus'd on me,
288    That beautie am I blest with, which you may see.
289    Aske me what question thou canst possible,
290    And I will answer vnpremeditated:
291    My Courage trie by Combat, if thou dar'st,
292    And thou shalt finde that I exceed my Sex.
293    Resolue on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
294    If thou receiue me for thy Warlike Mate.
295   *<S {Dolph}.> Thou hast astonisht me with thy high termes:
296    Onely this proofe Ile of thy Valour make,
297    In single Combat thou shalt buckle with me;
298    And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,
299    Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
300   *<S {Puzel}.> I am prepar'd: here is my keene- edg'd Sword,
301    Deckt with fine Flower- de- Luces on each side,
302    The which at Touraine, in S[aint]. {Katherines} Church- yard,
303    Out of a great deale of old Iron, I chose forth.
304    <S {Dolph}.> Then come #a Gods name, I feare no woman.
305    <S {Puzel}.> And while I liue, Ile ne're flye from a man.
306    <D {Here they fight, and Ioane de Puzel ouercomes}.>
307    <S {Dolph}.> Stay, stay thy hands, thou art an Amazon,
308    And fightest with the Sword of {Debora}.
309   *<S {Puzel}.> Christs Mother helpes me, else I were too
310    weake.
311   *<S {Dolph}.> Who e're helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
312    Impatiently I burne with thy desire,
313    My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd.
314    Excellent {Puzel}, if thy name be so,
315    Let me thy seruant, and not Soueraigne be,
316    'Tis the French Dolphin sueth to thee thus.
317    <S {Puzel}.> I must not yeeld to any rights of Loue,
318    For my Profession's sacred from aboue:
319    When I haue chased all thy Foes from hence,
320    Then will I thinke vpon a recompence.
321   *<S {Dolph}.> Meane time looke gracious on thy prostrate
322    Thrall.
323    <S {Reigneir}.> My Lord me thinkes is very long in talke.
324   *<S {Alans}.> Doubtlesse he shriues this woman to her smock,
325    Else ne're could he so long protract his speech.
326   *<S {Reigneir}.> Shall wee disturbe him, since hee keepes no
327    meane?
328   *<S {Alan}.> He may meane more then we poor men do know,
329    These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
330    <S {Reigneir}.> My Lord, where are you? what deuise you on?
331    Shall we giue o're Orleance, or no?
332    <S {Puzel}.> Why no, I say: distrustfull Recreants,
333    Fight till the last gaspe: Ile be your guard.
334   *<S {Dolph}.> What shee sayes, Ile confirme: wee'le fight
335    it out.
336    <S {Puzel}.> Assign'd am I to be the English Scourge.
337    This night the Siege assuredly Ile rayse:
338    Expect Saint {Martins} Summer, {Halcyons} dayes,
339    Since I haue entred into these Warres.
340    Glory is like a Circle in the Water,
341    Which neuer ceaseth to enlarge it selfe,
342    Till by broad spreading, it disperse to naught.
343    With {Henries} death, the English Circle ends,
344    Dispersed are the glories it included:
345    Now am I like that prowd insulting Ship,
346    Which {Caesar} and his fortune bare at once.
347    <S {Dolph}.> Was {Mahomet} inspired with a Doue?
348    Thou with an Eagle art inspired then.
349    {Helen}, the Mother of Great {Constantine},
350    Nor yet S[aint]. {Philips} daughters were like thee.
351    Bright Starre of {Venus}, falne downe on the Earth,
352    How may I reuerently worship thee enough?
353   *<S {Alanson}.> Leaue off delayes, and let vs rayse the
354    Siege.
      <P k4>
355   *<S {Reigneir}.> Woman, do what thou canst to saue our honors,
356    Driue them from Orleance, and be immortaliz'd.
357    <S {Dolph}.> Presently wee'le try: come, let's away about it,
358    No Prophet will I trust, if shee proue false.  <D {Exeunt}.>
359    <D {Enter Gloster, with his Seruing- men}.>
360    <S {Glost}.> I am come to suruey the Tower this day;
361    Since {Henries} death, I feare there is Conueyance:
362    Where be these Warders, that they wait not here?
363    Open the Gates, 'tis {Gloster} that calls.
364   *<S 1.{Warder}.> Who's there, that knocks so imperiously?
365    <S {Glost.1.Man}.> It is the Noble Duke of Gloster.
366    <S 2.{Warder}.> Who ere he be, you may not be let in.
367   *<S 1.{Man}.> Villaines, answer you so the Lord Protector?
368    <S 1.{Warder}.> The Lord protect him, so we answer him,
369    We doe no otherwise then wee are will'd.
370   *<S {Glost}.> Who willed you? or whose #will stands but mine?
371    There's none Protector of the Realme, but I:
372    Breake vp the Gates, Ile be your warrantize;
373    Shall I be flowted thus by dunghill Groomes?
374    <D {Glosters men rush at the Tower Gates, and Wooduile}
375    {the Lieutenant speakes within}.>
376   *<S {Wooduile}.> What noyse is this? what Traytors haue
377    wee here?
378    <S {Glost}.> Lieutenant, is it you whose voyce I heare?
379    Open the Gates, here's {Gloster} that would enter.
380    <S {Wooduile}.> Haue patience Noble Duke, I may not open,
381    The Cardinall of Winchester forbids:
382    From him I haue expresse commandement,
383    That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
384    <S {Glost}.> Faint- hearted {Wooduile}, prizest him 'fore me?
385    Arrogant {Winchester}, that haughtie Prelate,
386    Whom {Henry} our late Soueraigne ne're could brooke?
387    Thou art no friend to God, or to the King:
388    Open the Gates, or Ile shut thee out shortly.
389    <S {Seruingmen}.> Open the Gates vnto the Lord Protector,
390   *Or wee'le burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
391    <D {Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates, Winchester}
392    {and his men in Tawney Coates}.>
393   *<S {Winchest}.> How now ambitious {Vmpheir}, what meanes
394    this?
395   *<S {Glost}.> Piel'd Priest, doo'st thou command me to be
396    shut out?
397    <S {Winch}.> I doe, thou most vsurping Proditor,
398    And not Protector of the King or Realme.
399    <S {Glost}.> Stand back thou manifest Conspirator,
400    Thou that contriued'st to murther our dead Lord,
401    Thou that giu'st Whores Indulgences to sinne,
402    Ile canuas thee in thy broad Cardinalls Hat,
403    If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
404    <S {Winch}.> Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
405    This be Damascus, be thou cursed {Cain},
406    To slay thy Brother {Abel}, if thou wilt.
407    <S {Glost}.> I will not slay thee, but Ile driue thee back:
408    Thy Scarlet Robes, as a Childs bearing Cloth,
409    Ile vse, to carry thee out of this place.
410   *<S {Winch}.> Doe what thou dar'st, I beard thee to thy
411    face.
412    <S {Glost}.> What? am I dar'd, and bearded to my face?
413    Draw men, for all this priuiledged place,
414   *Blew Coats to Tawny Coats. Priest, beware your Beard,
415    I meane to tugge it, and to cuffe you soundly.
416    Vnder my feet I stampe thy Cardinalls Hat:
417    In spight of Pope, or dignities of Church,
418    Here by the Cheekes Ile drag thee vp and downe.
419   *<S {Winch}.> {Gloster}, thou wilt answere this before the
420    Pope.
421    <S {Glost}.> Winchester Goose, I cry, a Rope, a Rope.
422    Now beat them hence, why doe you let them stay?
423    Thee Ile chase hence, thou Wolfe in Sheepes array.
424    Out Tawney- Coates, out Scarlet Hypocrite.
425    <D {Here Glosters men beat out the Cardinalls men},
426    {and enter in the hurly- burly the Maior}
427    {of London, and his Officers}.>
428   *<S {Maior}.> Fye Lords, that you being supreme Magistrates,
429    Thus contumeliously should breake the Peace.
430    <S {Glost}.> Peace Maior, thou know'st little of my wrongs:
431    Here's {Beauford}, that regards nor God nor King,
432    Hath here distrayn'd the Tower to his vse.
433    <S {Winch}.> Here's {Gloster}, a Foe to Citizens,
434    One that still motions Warre, and neuer Peace,
435    O're- charging your free Purses with large Fines;
436    That seekes to ouerthrow Religion,
437    Because he is Protector of the Realme;
438    And would haue Armour here out of the Tower,
439    To Crowne himselfe King, and suppresse the Prince.
440   *<S {Glost}.> I will not answer thee with words, but blowes.
441    <D {Here they skirmish againe}.>
442    <S {Maior}.> Naught rests for me, in this tumultuous strife,
443    But to make open Proclamation.
444    Come Officer, as lowd as e're thou canst, cry:
445   *{All manner of men, assembled here in Armes this day,}
446   *{against Gods Peace and the Kings, wee charge and command}
447   *{you, in his Highnesse Name, to repayre to your seuerall dwel-ling}
448   *{places, and not to weare, handle, or vse any Sword, Wea-pon,}
449    {or Dagger hence- forward, vpon paine of death}.
450    <S {Glost}.> Cardinall, Ile be no breaker of the Law:
451    But we shall meet, and breake our minds at large.
452    <S {Winch}.> {Gloster}, wee'le meet to thy cost, be sure:
453    Thy heart- blood I will haue for this dayes worke.
454    <S {Maior}.> Ile call for Clubs, if you will not away:
455    This Cardinall's more haughtie then the Deuill.
456   *<S {Glost}.> Maior farewell: thou doo'st but what thou
457    may'st.
458    <S {Winch}.> Abhominable {Gloster}, guard thy Head,
459    For I intend to haue it ere long.  <D {Exeunt}.>
460    <S {Maior}.> See the Coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
461    Good God, these Nobles should such stomacks beare,
462    I my selfe fight not once in fortie yeere.  <D {Exeunt}.>
463    <D {Enter the Master Gunner of Orleance, and}
464    {his Boy}.>
465   *<S {M.Gunner}.> Sirrha, thou know'st how Orleance is besieg'd,
466    And how the English haue the Suburbs wonne.
467    <S {Boy}.> Father I know, and oft haue shot at them,
468    How e're vnfortunate, I miss'd my ayme.
469   *<S {M.Gunner}.> But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd by me:
470    Chiefe Master Gunner am I of this Towne,
471    Something I must doe to procure me grace:
472    The Princes espyals haue informed me,
473    How the English, in the Suburbs close entrencht,
474    Went through a secret Grate of Iron Barres,
475    In yonder Tower, to ouer- peere the Citie,
476    And thence discouer, how with most aduantage
477    They may vex vs with Shot or with Assault.
478    To intercept this inconuenience,
479    A Peece of Ordnance 'gainst it I haue plac'd,
      <P k4v>
480    And euen these three dayes haue I watcht,
481    If I could see them. Now doe thou watch,
482    For I can stay no longer.
483    If thou spy'st any, runne and bring me word,
484    And thou shalt finde me at the Gouernors.  <D {Exit}.>
485    <S {Boy}.> Father, I warrant you, take you no care,
486    Ile neuer trouble you, if I may spye them.  <D {Exit}.>
487    <D {Enter Salisbury and Talbot on the Turrets},
488    {with others}.>
489    <S {Salisb}.> {Talbot}, my life, my ioy, againe return'd?
490    How wert thou handled, being Prisoner?
491    Or by what meanes got's thou to be releas'd?
492    Discourse I prethee on this Turrets top.
493    <S {Talbot}.> The Earle of Bedford had a Prisoner,
494    Call'd the braue Lord {Ponton de Santrayle},
495    For him was I exchang'd, and ransom'd.
496    But with a baser man of Armes by farre,
497    Once in contempt they would haue barter'd me:
498    Which I disdaining, scorn'd, and craued death,
499    Rather then I would be so pil'd esteem'd:
500    In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
501    But O, the trecherous {Falstaffe} wounds my heart,
502    Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
503    If I now had him brought into my power.
504   *<S {Salisb}.> Yet tell'st thou not, how thou wert enter-tain'd.
505   _
506   *<S {Tal}.> With scoffes and scornes, and contumelious taunts,
507    In open Market- place produc't they me,
508    To be a publique spectacle to all:
509    Here, sayd they, is the Terror of the French,
510    The Scar- Crow that affrights our Children so.
511    Then broke I from the Officers that led me,
512    And with my nayles digg'd stones out of the ground,
513    To hurle at the beholders of my shame.
514    My grisly countenance made others flye,
515    None durst come neere, for feare of suddaine death.
516    In Iron Walls they deem'd me not secure:
517    So great feare of my Name 'mongst them were spread,
518    That they suppos'd I could rend Barres of Steele,
519    And spurne in pieces Posts of Adamant.
520    Wherefore a guard of chosen Shot I had,
521    That walkt about me euery Minute while:
522    And if I did but stirre out of my Bed,
523    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
524    <D {Enter the Boy with a Linstock}.>
525    <S {Salisb}.> I grieue to heare what torments you endur'd,
526    But we will be reueng'd sufficiently.
527    Now it is Supper time in Orleance:
528    Here, through this Grate, I count each one,
529    And view the Frenchmen how they fortifie:
530    Let vs looke in, the sight will much delight thee:
531    Sir {Thomas Gargraue}, and Sir {William Glansdale},
532    Let me haue your expresse opinions,
533    Where is best place to make our Batt'ry next?
534   *<S {Gargraue}.> I thinke at the North Gate, for there stands
535    Lords.
536   *<S {Glansdale}.> And I heere, at the Bulwarke of the
537    Bridge.
538    <S {Talb}.> For ought I see, this Citie must be famisht,
539    Or with light Skirmishes enfeebled.  <D {Here they shot, and}
540    {Salisbury falls downe}.>
541    <S {Salisb}.> O Lord haue mercy on vs, wretched sinners.
542    <S {Gargraue}.> O Lord haue mercy on me, wofull man.
543   *<S {Talb}.> What chance is this, that suddenly hath crost vs?
544    Speake {Salisbury}; at least, if thou canst, speake:
545    How far'st thou, Mirror of all Martiall men?
546    One of thy Eyes, and thy Cheekes side struck off?
547    Accursed Tower, accursed fatall Hand,
548    That hath contriu'd this wofull Tragedie.
549    In thirteene Battailes, {Salisbury} o'recame:
550    {Henry} the Fift he first trayn'd to the Warres.
551    Whil'st any Trumpe did sound, or Drum struck vp,
552    His Sword did ne're leaue striking in the field.
553    Yet liu'st thou {Salisbury}? though thy speech doth fayle,
554    One Eye thou hast to looke to Heauen for grace.
555    The Sunne with one Eye vieweth all the World.
556    Heauen be thou gracious to none aliue,
557    If {Salisbury} wants mercy at thy hands.
558    Beare hence his Body, I will helpe to bury it.
559    Sir {Thomas Gargraue}, hast thou any life?
560    Speake vnto {Talbot}, nay, looke vp to him.
561    {Salisbury} cheare thy Spirit with this comfort,
562    Thou shalt not dye whiles===
563    He beckens with his hand, and smiles on me:
564    As who should say, When I am dead and gone,
565    Remember to auenge me on the French.
566    {Plantaginet} I will, and like thee,
567    Play on the Lute, beholding the Townes burne:
568    Wretched shall France be onely in my Name.
569    <D {Here an Alarum, and it Thunders and Lightens}.>
570    What stirre is this? what tumult's in the Heauens?
571    Whence commeth this Alarum, and the noyse?
572    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
573   *<S {Mess}.> My Lord, my Lord, the French haue gather'd head.
574    The Dolphin, with one {Ioane de Puzel} ioyn'd,
575    A holy Prophetesse, new risen vp,
576    Is come with a great Power, to rayse the Siege.
577    <D {Here Salisbury lifteth himselfe vp, and groanes}.>
578   *<S {Talb}.> Heare, heare, how dying {Salisbury} doth groane,
579    It irkes his heart he cannot be reueng'd.
580    Frenchmen, Ile be a {Salisbury} to you.
581    {#Puzel} or {Pussel}, Dolphin or Dog- fish,
582    Your hearts Ile stampe out with my Horses heeles,
583    And make a Quagmire of your mingled braines.
584    Conuey me {Salisbury} into his Tent,
585   *And then wee'le try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
586    <D {Alarum. Exeunt}.>
587    <D {Here an Alarum againe, and Talbot pursueth the Dolphin,}
588    {and driueth him: Then enter Ioane de Puzel},
589    {driuing Englishmen before her}.
590    {Then enter Talbot}.>
591   *<S {Talb}.> Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
592    Our English Troupes retyre, I cannot stay them,
593    A Woman clad in Armour chaseth them.
594    <D {Enter Puzel}.>
595    Here, here shee comes. Ile haue a bowt with thee:
596    Deuill, or Deuils Dam, Ile coniure thee:
597    Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a Witch,
598    And straightway giue thy Soule to him thou seru'st.
599   *<S {Puzel}.> Come, come, 'tis onely I that must disgrace
600    thee.  <D {Here they fight}.>
601    <S {Talb}.> Heauens, can you suffer #Hell so to preuayle?
602    My brest Ile burst with straining of my courage,
603    And from my shoulders crack my Armes asunder,
604    But I will chastise this high- minded Strumpet.
605    <D {They fight againe}.>
606    <S {Puzel}.> {Talbot} farwell, thy houre is not yet come,
607    I must goe Victuall Orleance forthwith:
608    <D {A short Alarum: then enter the Towne}
609    {with Souldiers}.>
      <P k5>
610    O're- take me if thou canst, I scorne thy strength.
611    Goe, goe, cheare vp thy hungry- starued men,
612    Helpe {Salisbury} to make his Testament,
613    This Day is ours, as many more shall be.  <D {Exit}.>
614   *<S {Talb}.> My thoughts are whirled like a Potters Wheele,
615    I know not where I am, nor what I doe:
616    A Witch by feare, not force, like {Hannibal},
617    Driues back our troupes, and conquers as she lists:
618    So Bees with smoake, and Doues with noysome stench,
619    Are from their Hyues and Houses driuen away.
620    They call'd vs, for our fiercenesse, English Dogges,
621    Now like to Whelpes, we crying runne away.
622    <D {A short Alarum}.>
623    Hearke Countreymen, eyther renew the fight,
624    Or teare the Lyons out of Englands Coat;
625    Renounce your Soyle, giue Sheepe in Lyons stead:
626    Sheepe run not halfe so trecherous from the Wolfe,
627    Or Horse or Oxen from the Leopard,
628    As you flye from your oft- subdued slaues.
629    <D {Alarum. Here another Skirmish}.>
630    It will not be, retyre into your Trenches:
631    You all consented vnto {Salisburies} death,
632    For none would strike a stroake in his reuenge.
633    {#Puzel} is entred into Orleance,
634    In spight of vs, or ought that we could doe.
635    O would I were to dye with {Salisbury},
636    The shame hereof, will make me hide my head.
637    <D {Exit Talbot}.>
638    <D {Alarum, Retreat, Flourish}.>
639    <D {Enter on the Walls, Puzel, Dolphin, Reigneir},
640    {Alanson, and Souldiers}.>
641    <S {Puzel}.> Aduance our wauing Colours on the Walls,
642    Rescu'd is Orleance from the English.
643    Thus {Ioane de Puzel} hath perform'd her word.
644    <S {Dolph}.> Diuinest Creature, {Astrea's} Daughter,
645    How shall I honour thee for this successe?
646    Thy promises are like {Adonis} Garden,
647    That one day bloom'd, and fruitfull were the next.
648    France, triumph in thy glorious Prophetesse,
649    Recouer'd is the Towne of Orleance,
650    More blessed hap did ne're befall our State.
651    <S {Reigneir}.> Why ring not out the Bells alowd,
652    Throughout the Towne?
653    Dolphin command the Citizens make Bonfires,
654    And feast and banquet in the open streets,
655    To celebrate the ioy that God hath giuen vs.
656    <S {Alans}.> All France will be repleat with mirth and ioy,
657    When they shall heare how we haue play'd the men.
658   *<S {Dolph}.> 'Tis {Ioane}, not we, by whom the day is wonne:
659    For which, I will diuide my Crowne with her,
660    And all the Priests and Fryers in my Realme,
661    Shall in procession sing her endlesse prayse.
662    A statelyer Pyramis to her Ile reare,
663    Then {Rhodophe's} or {Memphis} euer was.
664    In memorie of her, when she is dead,
665    Her Ashes, in an Vrne more precious
666    Then the rich- iewel'd Coffer of {Darius},
667    Transported, shall be at high Festiuals
668    Before the Kings and Queenes of France.
669    No longer on Saint {Dennis} will we cry,
670    But {Ioane de Puzel} shall be France's Saint.
671    Come in, and let vs Banquet Royally,
672    After this Golden Day of Victorie.
673    <D {Flourish. Exeunt}.>
      <C B>
674    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
675    <D {Enter a Sergeant of a Band, with two Sentinels}.>
676    <S {Ser}.> Sirs, take your places, and be vigilant:
677    If any noyse or Souldier you perceiue
678    Neere to the walles, by some apparant signe
679    Let vs haue knowledge at the Court of Guard.
680    <S {Sent}.> Sergeant you shall. Thus are poore Seruitors
681    (When others sleepe vpon their quiet beds)
682    Constrain'd to watch in darknesse, raine, and cold.
683    <D {Enter Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy, with scaling}
684    {Ladders: Their Drummes beating a}
685    {Dead March}.>
686    <S {Tal}.> Lord Regent, and redoubted {Burgundy},
687    By whose approach, the Regions of {Artoys},
688    {Wallon}, and {Picardy}, are friends to vs:
689    This happy night, the Frenchmen are secure,
690    Hauing all day carows'd and banquetted,
691    Embrace we then this opportunitie,
692    As fitting best to quittance their deceite,
693    Contriu'd by #Art, and balefull Sorcerie.
694   *<S {Bed}.> Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,
695    Dispairing of his owne armes fortitude,
696    To ioyne with Witches, and the helpe of #Hell.
697    <S {Bur}.> Traitors haue neuer other company.
698    But what's that {Puzell} whom they tearme so pure?
699    <S {Tal}.> A Maid, they say.
700    <S {Bed}.> A Maid? And be so martiall?
701    <S {Bur}.> Pray God she proue not masculine ere long:
702    If vnderneath the Standard of the French
703    She carry Armour, as she hath begun.
704   *<S {Tal}.> Well, let them practise and conuerse with spirits.
705    God is our Fortresse, in whose conquering name
706    Let vs resolue to scale their flinty bulwarkes.
707    <S {Bed}.> Ascend braue {Talbot}, we will follow thee.
708    <S {Tal}.> Not altogether: Better farre I guesse,
709    That we do make our entrance seuerall wayes:
710    That if it chance the one of vs do faile,
711    The other yet may rise against their force.
712    <S {Bed}.> Agreed; Ile to yond corner.
713    <S {Bur}.> And I to this.
714   *<S {Tal}.> And heere will {Talbot} mount, or make his graue.
715    Now {Salisbury}, for thee and for the right
716    Of English {Henry}, shall this night appeare
717    How much in duty, I am bound to both.
718    <S {Sent}.> Arme, arme, the enemy doth make assault.
719    <D {Cry, S[aint]. George, A Talbot}.>
720    <D {The French leape ore the walles in their shirts. Enter}
721    {seuerall wayes, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier},
722    {halfe ready, and halfe vnready}.>
723    <S {Alan}.> How now my Lords? what all vnreadie so?
724    <S {Bast}.> Vnready? #I and glad we scap'd so well.
725   *<S {Reig}.> 'Twas time (I trow) to wake and leaue our beds,
726    Hearing Alarums at our Chamber doores.
727    <S {Alan}.> Of all exploits since first I follow'd Armes,
728    Nere heard I of a warlike enterprize
      <P k5v><C A>
729    More venturous, or desperate then this.
730    <S {Bast}.> I thinke this {Talbot} be a Fiend of #Hell.
731    <S {Reig}.> If not of #Hell, the Heauens sure fauour him.
732    <S {Alans}.> Here commeth {Charles}, I maruell how he sped?
733    <D {Enter Charles and Ioane}.>
734    <S {Bast}.> Tut, holy {Ioane} was his defensiue Guard.
735    <S {Charl}.> Is this thy cunning, thou deceitfull Dame?
736    Didst thou at first, to flatter vs withall,
737    Make vs partakers of a little gayne,
738    That now our losse might be ten times so much?
739    <S {Ioane}.> Wherefore is {Charles} impatient with his friend?
740    At all times will you haue my Power alike?
741    Sleeping or waking, must I still preuayle,
742    Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
743    Improuident Souldiors, had your Watch been good,
744    This sudden Mischiefe neuer could haue falne.
745    <S {Charl}.> Duke of Alanson, this was your default,
746    That being Captaine of the Watch to Night,
747    Did looke no better to that weightie Charge.
748    <S {Alans}.> Had all your Quarters been as safely kept,
749    As that whereof I had the gouernment,
750    We had not beene thus shamefully surpriz'd.
751    <S {Bast}.> Mine was secure.
752    <S {Reig}.> And so was mine, my Lord.
753    <S {Charl}.> And for my selfe, most part of all this Night
754    Within her Quarter, and mine owne Precinct,
755    I was imploy'd in passing to and fro,
756    About relieuing of the Centinels.
757    Then how, or which way, should they first breake in?
758    <S {Ioane}.> Question (my Lords) no further of the case,
759    How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place,
760    But weakely guarded, where the breach was made:
761    And now there rests no other shift but this,
762    To gather our Souldiors, scatter'd and disperc't,
763    And lay new Plat-formes to endammage them.
764    <D {Exeunt}.>
765    <D {Alarum. Enter a Souldier, crying, a Talbot, a Talbot:}
766    {they flye, leauing their Clothes behind}.>
767    <S {Sould}.> Ile be so bold to take what they haue left:
768    The Cry of {Talbot} serues me for a Sword,
769    For I haue loaden me with many Spoyles,
770    Vsing no other Weapon but his Name.  <D {Exit}.>
771    <D {Enter Talbot, Bedford, Burgundie}.>
772    <S {Bedf}.> The Day begins to breake, and Night is fled,
773    Whose pitchy Mantle ouer- vayl'd the Earth.
774    Here sound Retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.  <D {Retreat}.>
775    <S {Talb}.> Bring forth the Body of old {Salisbury},
776    And here aduance it in the Market- Place,
777    The middle Centure of this cursed Towne.
778    Now haue I pay'd my Vow vnto his Soule:
779    For euery drop of blood was drawne from him,
780    There hath at least fiue Frenchmen dyed to night.
781    And that hereafter Ages may behold
782    What ruine happened in reuenge of him,
783    Within their chiefest Temple Ile erect
784    A Tombe, wherein his Corps shall be interr'd:
785    Vpon the which, that euery one may reade,
786    Shall be engrau'd the sacke of Orleance,
787    The trecherous manner of his mournefull death,
788    And what a terror he had beene to France.
789    But Lords, in all our bloudy Massacre,
790    I muse we met not with the Dolphins Grace,
791    His new- come Champion, vertuous {Ioane} of Acre,
792    Nor any of his false Confederates.
793   *<S {Bedf}.> 'Tis thought Lord {Talbot}, when the fight began,
794    Rows'd on the sudden from their drowsie Beds,
795    They did amongst the troupes of armed men,
796    Leape o're the Walls for refuge in the field.
797    <S {Burg}.> My selfe, as farre as I could well discerne,
798    For smoake, and duskie vapours of the night,
799    Am sure I scar'd the Dolphin and his Trull,
800    When Arme in Arme they both came swiftly running,
801    Like to a payre of louing Turtle- Doues,
802    That could not liue asunder day or night.
803    After that things are set in order here,
804    Wee'le follow them with all the power we haue.
805    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
806   *<S {Mess}.> All hayle, my Lords: which of this Princely trayne
807    Call ye the Warlike {Talbot}, for his Acts
808    So much applauded through the Realme of France?
809   *<S {Talb}.> Here is the {Talbot}, who would speak with him?
810    <S {Mess}.> The vertuous Lady, Countesse of Ouergne,
811    With modestie admiring thy Renowne,
812    By me entreats (great Lord) thou would'st vouchsafe
813    To visit her poore Castle where she lyes,
814    That she may boast she hath beheld the man,
815    Whose glory fills the World with lowd report.
816    <S {Burg}.> Is it euen so? Nay, then I see our Warres
817    Will turne vnto a peacefull Comick sport,
818    When Ladyes craue to be encountred with.
819    You may not (my Lord) despise her gentle suit.
820   *<S {Talb}.> Ne're trust me then: for when a World of men
821    Could not preuayle with all their Oratorie,
822    Yet hath a Womans kindnesse ouer- rul'd:
823    And therefore tell her, I returne great thankes,
824    And in submission will attend on her.
825    Will not your Honors beare me company?
826    <S {Bedf}.> No, truly, 'tis more then manners will:
827    And I haue heard it sayd, Vnbidden Guests
828    Are often welcommest when they are gone.
829    <S {Talb}.> Well then, alone (since there's no remedie)
830    I meane to proue this Ladyes courtesie.
831    Come hither Captaine, you perceiue my minde.
832    <D {Whispers}.>
833    <S {Capt}.> I doe my Lord, and meane accordingly.
834    <D {Exeunt}.>
835    <D {Enter Countesse}.>
836    <S {Count}.> Porter, remember what I gaue in charge,
837    And when you haue done so, bring the Keyes to me.
838    <S {Port}.> Madame, I will.  <D {Exit}.>
839    <S {Count}.> The Plot is layd, if all things fall out right,
840    I shall as famous be by this exploit,
841    As Scythian {Tomyris} by {Cyrus} death.
842    Great is the rumour of this dreadfull Knight,
843    And his atchieuements of no lesse account:
844    Faine would mine eyes be witnesse with mine eares,
845    To giue their censure of these rare reports.
846    <D {Enter Messenger and Talbot}.>
847    <S {Mess}.> Madame, according as your Ladyship desir'd,
848    By Message crau'd, so is Lord {Talbot} come.
849    <S {Count}.> And he is welcome: what? is this the man?
850    <S {Mess}.> Madame, it is.
851    <S {Count}.> Is this the Scourge of France?
852    Is this the {Talbot}, so much fear'd abroad?
853    That with his Name the Mothers still their Babes?
854    I see Report is fabulous and false.
      <P k6>
855    I thought I should haue seene some {Hercules},
856    A second {Hector}, for his grim aspect,
857    And large proportion of his strong knit Limbes.
858    Alas, this is a Child, a silly Dwarfe:
859    It cannot be, this weake and writhled shrimpe
860    Should strike such terror to his Enemies.
861    <S {Talb}.> Madame, I haue beene bold to trouble you:
862    But since your Ladyship is not at leysure,
863    Ile sort some other time to visit you.
864    <S {Count}.> What meanes he now?
865    Goe aske him, whither he goes?
866    <S {Mess}.> Stay my Lord {Talbot}, for my Lady craues,
867    To know the cause of your abrupt departure?
868    <S {Talb}.> Marry, for that shee's in a wrong beleefe,
869    I goe to certifie her {Talbot}'s here.
870    <D {Enter Porter with Keyes}.>
871    <S {Count}.> If thou be he, then art thou Prisoner.
872    <S {Talb}.> Prisoner? to whom?
873    <S {Count}.> To me, blood- thirstie Lord:
874    And for that cause I trayn'd thee to my House.
875    Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
876    For in my Gallery thy Picture hangs:
877    But now the substance shall endure the like,
878    And I will chayne these Legges and Armes of thine,
879    That hast by Tyrannie these many yeeres
880    Wasted our Countrey, slaine our Citizens,
881    And sent our Sonnes and Husbands captiuate.
882    <S {Talb}.> Ha, ha, ha.
883    <S {Count}.> Laughest thou Wretch?
884    Thy mirth shall turne to moane.
885    <S {Talb}.> I laugh to see your Ladyship so fond,
886    To thinke, that you haue ought but {Talbots} shadow,
887    Whereon to practise your seueritie.
888    <S {Count}.> Why? art not thou the man?
889    <S {Talb}.> I am indeede.
890    <S {Count}.> Then haue I substance too.
891    <S {Talb}.> No, no, I am but shadow of my selfe:
892    You are deceiu'd, my substance is not here;
893    For what you see, is but the smallest part,
894    And least proportion of Humanitie:
895    I tell you Madame, were the whole Frame here,
896    It is of such a spacious loftie pitch,
897    Your Roofe were not sufficient to contayn't.
898    <S {Count}.> This is a Riddling Merchant for the nonce,
899    He will be here, and yet he is not here:
900    How can these contrarieties agree?
901    <S {Talb}.> That will I shew you presently.
902    <D {Winds his Horne, Drummes strike vp, a Peale}
903    {of Ordenance: Enter Souldiors}.>
904    How say you Madame? are you now perswaded,
905    That {Talbot} is but shadow of himselfe?
906    These are his substance, sinewes, armes, and strength,
907    With which he yoaketh your rebellious Neckes,
908    Razeth your Cities, and subuerts your Townes,
909    And in a moment makes them desolate.
910    <S {Count}.> Victorious {Talbot}, pardon my abuse,
911    I finde thou art no lesse then Fame hath bruited,
912    And more then may be gathered by thy shape.
913    Let my presumption not prouoke thy wrath,
914    For I am sorry, that with reuerence
915    I did not entertaine thee as thou art.
916    <S {Talb}.> Be not dismay'd, faire Lady, nor misconster
917    The minde of {Talbot}, as you did mistake
918    The outward composition of his body.
919    What you haue done, hath not offended me:
920    Nor other satisfaction doe I craue,
921    But onely with your patience, that we may
922    Taste of your Wine, and see what Cates you haue,
923    For Souldiers stomacks alwayes serue them well.
924    <S {Count}.> With all my heart, and thinke me honored,
925    To feast so great a Warrior in my House.  <D {Exeunt}.>
926    <D {Enter Richard Plantagenet, Warwick, Somerset},
927    {Poole, and others}.>
928    <S {Yorke}.> Great Lords and Gentlemen,
929    What meanes this silence?
930    Dare no man answer in a Case of Truth?
931    <S {Suff}.> Within the Temple Hall we were too lowd,
932    The Garden here is more conuenient.
933    <S {York}.> Then say at once, if I maintain'd the Truth:
934    Or else was wrangling {Somerset} in th' error?
935    <S {Suff}.> Faith I haue beene a Truant in the Law,
936    And neuer yet could frame my #will to it,
937    And therefore frame the Law vnto my #will.
938   *<S {Som}.> Iudge you, my Lord of Warwicke, then be-tweene
939    vs.
940   *<S {War}.> Between two Hawks, which flyes the higher pitch,
941    Between two Dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,
942    Between two Blades, which beares the better temper,
943    Between two Horses, which doth beare him best,
944    Between two Girles, which hath the merryest eye,
945    I haue perhaps some shallow spirit of Iudgement:
946    But in these nice sharpe Quillets of the Law,
947    Good faith I am no wiser then a Daw.
948    <S {York}.> Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
949    The truth appeares so naked on my side,
950    That any purblind eye may find it out.
951    <S {Som}.> And on my side it is so well apparrell'd,
952    So cleare, so shining, and so euident,
953    That it will glimmer through a blind- mans eye.
954   *<S {York}.> Since you are tongue- ty'd, and so loth to speake,
955    In dumbe significants proclayme your thoughts:
956    Let him that is a true- borne Gentleman,
957    And stands vpon the honor of his birth,
958    If he suppose that I haue pleaded truth,
959    From off this Bryer pluck a white Rose with me.
960    <S {Som}.> Let him that is no Coward, nor no Flatterer,
961    But dare maintaine the partie of the truth,
962    Pluck a red Rose from off this Thorne with me.
963    <S {War}.> I loue no Colours: and without all colour
964    Of base insinuating flatterie,
965    I pluck this white Rose with {Plantagenet}.
966    <S {Suff}.> I pluck this red Rose, with young {Somerset},
967    And say withall, I thinke he held the right.
968   *<S {Vernon}.> Stay Lords and Gentlemen, and pluck no more
969    Till you conclude, that he vpon whose side
970    The fewest Roses are cropt from the Tree,
971    Shall yeeld the other in the right opinion.
972    <S {Som}.> Good Master {Vernon}, it is well obiected:
973    If I haue fewest, I subscribe in silence.
974    <S {York}.> And I.
975   *<S {Vernon}.> Then for the truth, and plainnesse of the Case,
976    I pluck this pale and Maiden Blossome here,
977    Giuing my Verdict on the white Rose side.
978    <S {Som}.> Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
979    Least bleeding, you doe paint the white Rose red,
980    And fall on my side so against your #will.
981    <S {Vernon}.> If I, my Lord, for my opinion bleed,
982    Opinion shall be Surgeon to my hurt,
983    And keepe me on the side where still I am.
984    <S {Som}.> Well, well, come on, who else?
      <P k6v>
985    <S {Lawyer}.> Vnlesse my Studie and my Bookes be false,
986    The argument you held, was wrong in you;
987    In signe whereof, I pluck a white Rose too.
988    <S {Yorke}.> Now {Somerset}, where is your argument?
989    <S {Som}.> Here in my Scabbard, meditating, that
990    Shall dye your white Rose in a bloody red.
991   *<S {York}.> Meane time your cheeks do counterfeit our Roses:
992    For pale they looke with feare, as witnessing
993    The truth on our side.
994    <S {Som}.> No {Plantagenet}:
995    Tis not for feare, but anger, that thy cheekes
996    Blush for pure shame, to counterfeit our Roses,
997    And yet thy tongue will not confesse thy error.
998    <S {Yorke}.> Hath not thy Rose a Canker, {Somerset}?
999    <S {Som}.> Hath not thy Rose a Thorne, {Plantagenet}?
1000   <S {Yorke}.> #I, sharpe and piercing to maintaine his truth,
1001   Whiles thy consuming Canker eates his falsehood.
1002  *<S {Som}.> Well, Ile find friends to weare my bleeding Roses,
1003   That shall maintaine what I haue said is true,
1004   Where false {Plantagenet} dare not be seene.
1005   <S {Yorke}.> Now by this Maiden Blossome in my hand,
1006   I scorne thee and thy fashion, peeuish Boy.
1007   <S {Suff}.> Turne not thy scornes this way, {Plantagenet}.
1008  *<S {Yorke}.> Prowd {Poole}, I will, and scorne both him and
1009   thee.
1010   <S {Suff}.> Ile turne my part thereof into thy throat.
1011   <S {Som}.> Away, away, good {William de la Poole},
1012   We grace the Yeoman, by conuersing with him.
1013  *<S {Warw}.> Now by Gods #will thou wrong'st him, {Somerset}:
1014   His Grandfather was {Lyonel} Duke of Clarence,
1015   Third Sonne to the third {Edward} King of England:
1016   Spring Crestlesse Yeomen from so deepe a Root?
1017   <S {Yorke}.> He beares him on the place's Priuiledge,
1018   Or durst not for his crauen heart say thus.
1019   <S {Som}.> By him that made me, Ile maintaine my words
1020   On any Plot of Ground in Christendome.
1021   Was not thy Father, {Richard}, Earle of Cambridge,
1022   For Treason executed in our late Kings dayes?
1023   And by his Treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
1024   Corrupted, and exempt from ancient Gentry?
1025   His Trespas yet liues guiltie in thy blood,
1026   And till thou be restor'd, thou art a Yeoman.
1027   <S {Yorke}.> My Father was attached, not attainted,
1028   Condemn'd to dye for Treason, but no Traytor;
1029   And that Ile proue on better men then {Somerset},
1030   Were growing time once ripened to my #will.
1031   For your partaker {Poole}, and you your selfe,
1032   Ile note you in my Booke of Memorie,
1033   To scourge you for this apprehension:
1034   Looke to it well, and say you are well warn'd.
1035   <S {Som}.> Ah, thou shalt finde vs ready for thee still:
1036   And know vs by these Colours for thy Foes,
1037   For these, my friends in spight of thee shall weare.
1038   <S {Yorke}.> And by my Soule, this pale and angry Rose,
1039   As Cognizance of my blood- drinking hate,
1040   Will I for euer, and my Faction weare,
1041   Vntill it wither with me to my Graue,
1042   Or flourish to the height of my Degree.
1043  *<S {Suff}.> Goe forward, and be choak'd with thy ambition:
1044   And so farwell, vntill I meet thee next.  <D {Exit}.>
1045  *<S {Som}.> Haue with thee {Poole}: Farwell ambitious {Ri-chard}.
1046   <D {Exit}.>
1047  *<S {Yorke}.> How I am brau'd, and must perforce endure
1048   it?
1049  *<S {Warw}.> This blot that they obiect against your House,
1050   Shall be whipt out in the next Parliament,
1051   Call'd for the Truce of {Winchester} and {Gloucester}:
1052   And if thou be not then created {Yorke},
1053   I will not liue to be accounted {Warwicke}.
1054   Meane time, in signall of my loue to thee,
1055   Against prowd {Somerset}, and {William Poole},
1056   Will I vpon thy partie weare this Rose.
1057   And here I prophecie: this brawle to day,
1058   Growne to this faction in the Temple Garden,
1059   Shall send betweene the Red- Rose and the White,
1060   A thousand Soules to Death and deadly Night.
1061   <S {Yorke}.> Good Master {Vernon}, I am bound to you,
1062   That you on my behalfe would pluck a Flower.
1063   <S {Ver}.> In your behalfe still will I weare the same.
1064   <S {Lawyer}.> And so will I.
1065   <S {Yorke}.> Thankes gentle.
1066   Come, let vs foure to Dinner: I dare say,
1067   This Quarrell will drinke Blood another day.
1068   <D {Exeunt}.>
1069   <D {Enter Mortimer, brought in a Chayre},
1070   {and Iaylors}.>
1071   <S {Mort}.> Kind Keepers of my weake decaying Age,
1072   Let dying {Mortimer} here rest himselfe.
1073   Euen like a man new haled from the Wrack,
1074   So fare my Limbes with long Imprisonment:
1075   And these gray Locks, the Pursuiuants of death,
1076   {Nestor}- like aged, in an Age of Care,
1077   Argue the end of {Edmund Mortimer}.
1078   These Eyes like Lampes, whose wasting Oyle is spent,
1079   Waxe dimme, as drawing to their Exigent.
1080   Weake Shoulders, ouer- borne with burthening Griefe,
1081   And pyth- lesse Armes, like to a withered Vine,
1082   That droupes his sappe- lesse Branches to the ground.
1083   Yet are these Feet, whose strength- lesse stay is numme,
1084   (Vnable to support this Lumpe of Clay)
1085   Swift- winged with desire to get a Graue,
1086   As witting I no other comfort haue.
1087   But tell me, Keeper, will my Nephew come?
1088   <S {Keeper}.> {Richard Plantagenet}, my Lord, will come:
1089   We sent vnto the Temple, vnto his Chamber,
1090   And answer was return'd, that he will come.
1091   <S {Mort}.> Enough: my Soule shall then be satisfied.
1092   Poore Gentleman, his wrong doth equall mine.
1093   Since {Henry Monmouth} first began to reigne,
1094   Before whose Glory I was great in Armes,
1095   This loathsome sequestration haue I had;
1096   And euen since then, hath {Richard} beene obscur'd,
1097   Depriu'd of Honor and Inheritance.
1098   But now, the Arbitrator of Despaires,
1099   Iust Death, kinde Vmpire of mens miseries,
1100   With sweet enlargement doth dismisse me hence:
1101   I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,
1102   That so he might recouer what was lost.
1103   <D {Enter Richard}.>
1104  *<S {Keeper}.> My Lord, your louing Nephew now is come.
1105   <S {Mor}.> {Richard Plantagenet}, my friend, is he come?
1106   <S {Rich}.> #I, Noble Vnckle, thus ignobly vs'd,
1107   Your Nephew, late despised {Richard}, comes.
1108   <S {Mort}.> Direct mine Armes, I may embrace his Neck,
1109   And in his Bosome spend my latter gaspe.
1110   Oh tell me when my Lippes doe touch his Cheekes,
1111   That I may kindly giue one fainting Kisse.
1112   And now declare sweet Stem from {Yorkes} great Stock,
1113   Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd?
      <P l1>
1114   <S {Rich}.> First, leane thine aged Back against mine Arme,
1115   And in that ease, Ile tell thee my Disease.
1116   This day in argument vpon a Case,
1117   Some words there grew 'twixt {Somerset} and me:
1118   Among which tearmes, he vs'd his lauish tongue,
1119   And did vpbrayd me with my Fathers death;
1120   Which obloquie set barres before my tongue,
1121   Else with the like I had requited him.
1122   Therefore good Vnckle, for my Fathers sake,
1123   In honor of a true {Plantagenet},
1124   And for Alliance sake, declare the cause
1125   My Father, Earle of Cambridge, lost his Head.
1126   <S {Mort}.> That cause (faire Nephew) that imprison'd me,
1127   And hath detayn'd me all my flowring Youth,
1128   Within a loathsome Dungeon, there to pyne,
1129   Was cursed Instrument of his decease.
1130   <S {Rich}.> Discouer more at large what cause that was,
1131   For I am ignorant, and cannot guesse.
1132   <S {Mort}.> I will, if that my fading breath permit,
1133   And Death approach not, ere my Tale be done.
1134   {Henry} the Fourth, Grandfather to this King,
1135   Depos'd his Nephew {Richard}, {Edwards} Sonne,
1136   The first begotten, and the lawfull Heire
1137   Of {Edward} King, the Third of that Descent.
1138   During whose Reigne, the {Percies} of the North,
1139   Finding his Vsurpation most vniust,
1140   Endeuour'd my aduancement to the Throne.
1141   The reason mou'd these Warlike Lords to this,
1142   Was, for that (young {Richard} thus remou'd,
1143   Leauing no Heire begotten of his Body)
1144   I was the next by Birth and Parentage:
1145   For by my Mother, I deriued am
1146   From {Lionel} Duke of Clarence, third Sonne
1147   To King {Edward} the Third; whereas hee,
1148   From {Iohn} of Gaunt doth bring his Pedigree,
1149   Being but fourth of that Heroick Lyne.
1150   But marke: as in this haughtie great attempt,
1151   They laboured, to plant the rightfull Heire,
1152   I lost my Libertie, and they their Liues.
1153   Long after this, when {Henry} the Fift
1154   (Succeeding his Father {Bullingbrooke}) did reigne;
1155   Thy Father, Earle of Cambridge, then deriu'd
1156   From famous {Edmund Langley}, Duke of Yorke,
1157   Marrying my Sister, that thy Mother was;
1158   Againe, in pitty of my hard distresse,
1159   Leuied an Army, weening to redeeme,
1160   And haue install'd me in the Diademe:
1161   But as the rest, so fell that Noble Earle,
1162   And was beheaded. Thus the {Mortimers},
1163   In whom the Title rested, were supprest.
1164   <S {Rich}.> Of which, my Lord, your Honor is the last.
1165   <S {Mort}.> True; and thou seest, that I no Issue haue,
1166   And that my fainting words doe warrant death:
1167   Thou art my Heire; the rest, I wish thee gather:
1168   But yet be wary in thy studious care.
1169   <S {Rich}.> Thy graue admonishments preuayle with me:
1170   But yet me thinkes, my Fathers execution
1171   Was nothing lesse then bloody Tyranny.
1172   <S {Mort}.> With silence, Nephew, be thou pollitick,
1173   Strong fixed is the House of {Lancaster},
1174   And like a Mountaine, not to be remou'd.
1175   But now thy Vnckle is remouing hence,
1176   As Princes doe their Courts, when they are cloy'd
1177   With long continuance in a setled place.
1178   <S {Rich}.> O Vnckle, would some part of my young yeeres
1179   Might but redeeme the passage of your Age.
1180  *<S {Mort}.> Thou do'st then wrong me, as y slaughterer doth,
1181   Which giueth many Wounds, when one will kill.
1182   Mourne not, except thou sorrow for my good,
1183   Onely giue order for my Funerall.
1184   And so farewell, and faire be all thy hopes,
1185   And prosperous be thy Life in Peace and Warre.  <D {Dyes}.>
1186   <S {Rich}.> And Peace, no Warre, befall thy parting Soule.
1187   In Prison hast thou spent a Pilgrimage,
1188   And like a Hermite ouer- past thy dayes.
1189   Well, I will locke his Councell in my Brest,
1190   And what I doe imagine, let that rest.
1191   Keepers conuey him hence, and I my selfe
1192   Will see his Buryall better then his Life.  <D {Exit}.>
1193   Here dyes the duskie Torch of {Mortimer},
1194   Choakt with Ambition of the meaner sort.
1195   And for those Wrongs, those bitter Iniuries,
1196   Which {Somerset} hath offer'd to my House,
1197   I doubt not, but with Honor to redresse.
1198   And therefore haste I to the Parliament,
1199   Eyther to be restored to my Blood,
1200   Or make my #will th' aduantage of my good.  <D {Exit}.>
1201   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1202   <D {Flourish. Enter King, Exeter, Gloster, Winchester, Warwick}.
1203   {Somerset, Suffolk, Richard Plantagenet. Gloster offers}
1204   {to put vp a Bill: Winchester snatches it, teares it}.>
1205   <S {Winch}.> Com'st thou with deepe premeditated Lines?
1206   With written Pamphlets, studiously deuis'd?
1207   {Humfrey} of Gloster, if thou canst accuse,
1208   Or ought intend'st to lay vnto my charge,
1209   Doe it without inuention, suddenly,
1210   As I with sudden, and extemporall speech,
1211   Purpose to answer what thou canst obiect.
1212  *<S {Glo}.> Presumptuous Priest, this place co[m]mands my patie[n]ce,
1213   Or thou should'st finde thou hast dis- honor'd me.
1214   Thinke not, although in Writing I preferr'd
1215   The manner of thy vile outragious Crymes,
1216   That therefore I haue forg'd, or am not able
1217   {Verbatim} to rehearse the Methode of my Penne.
1218   No Prelate, such is thy audacious wickednesse,
1219   Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious prancks,
1220   As very Infants prattle of thy pride.
1221   Thou art a most pernitious Vsurer,
1222   Froward by nature, Enemie to Peace,
1223   Lasciuious, wanton, more then well beseemes
1224   A man of thy Profession, and Degree.
1225   And for thy Trecherie, what's more manifest?
1226   In that thou layd'st a Trap to take my Life,
1227   As well at London Bridge, as at the Tower.
1228   Beside, I feare me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
1229   The King, thy Soueraigne, is not quite exempt
1230   From enuious mallice of thy swelling heart.
1231   <S {Winch}.> {Gloster}, I doe defie thee. Lords vouchsafe
1232   To giue me hearing what I shall reply.
1233   If I were couetous, ambitious, or peruerse,
1234   As he will haue me: how am I so poore?
1235   Or how haps it, I seeke not to aduance
1236   Or rayse my selfe? but keepe my wonted Calling.
1237   And for Dissention, who preferreth Peace
1238   More then I doe? except I be prouok'd.
1239   No, my good Lords, it is not that offends,
1240   It is not that, that hath incens'd the Duke:
1241   It is because no one should sway but hee,
1242   No one, but hee, should be about the King;
1243   And that engenders Thunder in his breast,
      <P l1v>
1244   And makes him rore these Accusations forth.
1245   But he shall know I am as good.
1246   <S {Glost}.> As good?
1247   Thou Bastard of my Grandfather.
1248   <S {Winch}.> #I, Lordly Sir: for what are you, I pray,
1249   But one imperious in anothers Throne?
1250   <S {Glost}.> Am I not Protector, sawcie Priest?
1251   <S {Winch}.> And am not I a Prelate of the Church?
1252   <S {Glost}.> Yes, as an Out- law in a Castle keepes,
1253   And vseth it, to patronage his Theft.
1254   <S {Winch}.> Vnreuerent {Glocester}.
1255   <S {Glost}.> Thou art reuerent,
1256   Touching thy Spirituall Function, not thy Life.
1257   <S {Winch}.> Rome shall remedie this.
1258   <S {Warw}.> Roame thither then.
1259   My Lord, it were your dutie to forbeare.
1260   <S {Som}.> #I, see the Bishop be not ouer- borne:
1261   Me thinkes my Lord should be Religious,
1262   And know the Office that belongs to such.
1263   <S {Warw}.> Me thinkes his Lordship should be humbler,
1264   It fitteth not a Prelate so to plead.
1265   <S {Som}.> Yes, when his holy State is toucht so neere.
1266   <S {Warw}.> State holy, or vnhallow'd, what of that?
1267   Is not his Grace Protector to the King?
1268   <S {Rich}.> {Plantagenet} I see must hold his tongue,
1269   Least it be said, Speake Sirrha when you should:
1270   Must your bold Verdict enter talke with Lords?
1271   Else would I haue a fling at {Winchester}.
1272   <S {King}.> Vnckles of {Gloster}, and of {Winchester},
1273   The speciall Watch- men of our English Weale,
1274   I would preuayle, if Prayers might preuayle,
1275   To ioyne your hearts in loue and amitie.
1276   Oh, what a Scandall is it to our Crowne,
1277   That two such Noble Peeres as ye should iarre?
1278   Beleeue me, Lords, my tender yeeres can tell,
1279   Ciuill dissention is a viperous Worme,
1280   That gnawes the Bowels of the Common- wealth.
1281   <D {A noyse within, Downe with the}
1282   {Tawny- Coats}.>
1283   <S {King}.> What tumult's this?
1284   <S {Warw}.> An Vprore, I dare warrant,
1285   Begun through malice of the Bishops men.
1286   <D {A noyse againe, Stones, Stones}.>
1287   <D {Enter Maior}.>
1288   <S {Maior}.> Oh my good Lords, and vertuous {Henry},
1289   Pitty the Citie of London, pitty vs:
1290   The Bishop, and the Duke of Glosters men,
1291   Forbidden late to carry any Weapon,
1292   Haue fill'd their Pockets full of peeble stones;
1293   And banding themselues in contrary parts,
1294   Doe pelt so fast at one anothers Pate,
1295   That many haue their giddy braynes knockt out:
1296   Our Windowes are broke downe in euery Street,
1297   And we, for feare, compell'd to shut our Shops.
1298   <D {Enter in skirmish with bloody Pates}.>
1299   <S {King}.> We charge you, on allegeance to our selfe,
1300   To hold your slaughtring hands, and keepe the Peace:
1301   Pray' Vnckle {Gloster} mittigate this strife.
1302  *<S 1.{Seruing}.> Nay, if we be forbidden Stones, wee'le fall
1303   to it with our Teeth.
1304   <S 2.{Seruing}.> Doe what ye dare, we are as resolute.
1305   <D {Skirmish againe}.>
1306  *<S {Glost}.> You of my household, leaue this peeuish broyle,
1307   And set this vnaccustom'd fight aside.
1308   <S 3.{Seru}.> My Lord, we know your Grace to be a man
1309   Iust, and vpright; and for your Royall Birth,
1310   Inferior to none, but to his Maiestie:
1311   And ere that we will suffer such a Prince,
1312   So kinde a Father of the Common- weale,
1313   To be disgraced by an Inke- horne Mate,
1314   Wee and our Wiues and Children all will fight,
1315   And haue our bodyes slaughtred by thy foes.
1316   <S 1.{Seru}.> #I, and the very parings of our Nayles
1317   Shall pitch a Field when we are dead.
1318   <D {Begin againe}.>
1319   <S {Glost}.> Stay, stay, I say:
1320   And if you loue me, as you say you doe,
1321   Let me perswade you to forbeare #a while.
1322   <S {King}.> Oh, how this discord doth afflict my Soule.
1323   Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
1324   My sighes and teares, and will not once relent?
1325   Who should be pittifull, if you be not?
1326   Or who should study to preferre a Peace,
1327   If holy Church- men take delight in broyles?
1328   <S {Warw}.> Yeeld my Lord Protector, yeeld {Winchester},
1329   Except you meane with obstinate repulse
1330   To slay your Soueraigne, and destroy the Realme.
1331   You see what Mischiefe, and what Murther too,
1332   Hath beene enacted through your enmitie:
1333   Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood.
1334   <S {Winch}.> He shall submit, or I will neuer yeeld.
1335  *<S {Glost}.> Compassion on the King commands me stoupe,
1336   Or I would see his heart out, ere the Priest
1337   Should euer get that priuiledge of me.
1338   <S {Warw}.> Behold my Lord of Winchester, the Duke
1339   Hath banisht moodie discontented fury,
1340   As by his smoothed Browes it doth appeare:
1341   Why looke you still so sterne, and tragicall?
1342   <S {Glost}.> Here {Winchester}, I offer thee my Hand.
1343  *<S {King}.> Fie Vnckle {Beauford}, I haue heard you preach,
1344   That Mallice was a great and grieuous sinne:
1345   And will not you maintaine the thing you teach?
1346   But proue a chiefe offendor in the same.
1347   <S {Warw}.> Sweet King: the Bishop hath a kindly gyrd:
1348   For shame my Lord of Winchester relent;
1349   What, shall a Child instruct you what to doe?
1350   <S {Winch}.> Well, Duke of Gloster, I will yeeld to thee
1351   Loue for thy Loue, and Hand for Hand I giue.
1352   <S {Glost}.> #I, but I feare me with a hollow Heart.
1353   See here my Friends and louing Countreymen,
1354   This token serueth for a Flagge of Truce,
1355   Betwixt our selues, and all our followers:
1356   So helpe me God, as I dissemble not.
1357   <S {Winch}.> So helpe me God, as I intend it not.
1358   <S {King}.> Oh louing Vnckle, kinde Duke of Gloster,
1359   How ioyfull am I made by this Contract.
1360   Away my Masters, trouble vs no more,
1361   But ioyne in friendship, as your Lords haue done.
1362   <S 1.{Seru}.> Content, Ile to the Surgeons.
1363   <S 2.{Seru}.> And so will I.
1364  *<S 3.{Seru}.> And I will see what Physick the Tauerne af-fords.
1365   <D {Exeunt}.>
1366  *<S {Warw}.> Accept this Scrowle, most gracious Soueraigne,
1367   Which in the Right of {Richard Plantagenet},
1368   We doe exhibite to your Maiestie.
1369  *<S {Glo}.> Well vrg'd, my Lord of Warwick: for sweet Prince,
1370   #And if your Grace marke euery circumstance,
1371   You haue great reason to doe {Richard} right,
1372   Especially for those occasions
1373   At Eltam Place I told your Maiestie.
      <P l2>
1374   <S {King}.> And those occasions, Vnckle, were of force:
1375   Therefore my louing Lords, our pleasure is,
1376   That {Richard} be restored to his Blood.
1377   <S {Warw}.> Let {Richard} be restored to his Blood,
1378   So shall his Fathers wrongs be recompenc't.
1379   <S {Winch}.> As will the rest, so willeth {Winchester}.
1380   <S {King}.> If {Richard} will be true, not that all alone,
1381   But all the whole Inheritance I giue,
1382   That doth belong vnto the House of {Yorke},
1383   From whence you spring, by Lineall Descent.
1384   <S {Rich}.> Thy humble seruant vowes obedience,
1385   And humble seruice, till the point of death.
1386  *<S {King}.> Stoope then, and set your Knee against my Foot,
1387   And in reguerdon of that dutie done,
1388   I gyrt thee with the valiant Sword of {Yorke}:
1389   Rise {Richard}, like a true {Plantagenet},
1390   And rise created Princely Duke of {Yorke}.
1391   <S {Rich}.> And so thriue {Richard}, as thy foes may fall,
1392   And as my dutie springs, so perish they,
1393   That grudge one thought against your Maiesty.
1394  *<S {All}.> Welcome high Prince, the mighty Duke of {Yorke}.
1395   <S {Som}.> Perish base Prince, ignoble Duke of {Yorke}.
1396   <S {Glost}.> Now will it best auaile your Maiestie,
1397   To crosse the Seas, and to be Crown'd in France:
1398   The presence of a King engenders loue
1399   Amongst his Subiects, and his loyall Friends,
1400   As it dis- animates his Enemies.
1401   <S {King}.> When {Gloster} sayes the word, King {Henry} goes,
1402   For friendly counsaile cuts off many Foes.
1403   <S {Glost}.> Your Ships alreadie are in readinesse.
1404   <D {Senet. Flourish. Exeunt}.>
1405   <D {Manet Exeter}.>
1406   <S {Exet}.> #I, we may march in England, or in France,
1407   Not seeing what is likely to ensue:
1408   This late dissention growne betwixt the Peeres,
1409   Burnes vnder fained ashes of forg'd loue,
1410   And will at last breake out into a flame,
1411   As festred members rot but by degree,
1412   Till bones and flesh and sinewes fall away,
1413   So will this base and enuious discord breed.
1414   And now I feare that fatall Prophecie,
1415   Which in the time of {Henry}, nam'd the Fift,
1416   Was in the mouth of euery sucking Babe,
1417   That {Henry} borne at Monmouth should winne all,
1418   And {Henry} borne at Windsor, loose all:
1419   Which is so plaine, that {Exeter} doth wish,
1420   His dayes may finish, ere that haplesse time.  <D {Exit}.>
1421   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1422   <D {Enter Pucell disguis'd, with foure Souldiors with}
1423   {Sacks vpon their backs}.>
1424   <S {Pucell}.> These are the Citie Gates, the Gates of Roan,
1425   Through which our Pollicy must make a breach.
1426   Take heed, be wary how you place your words,
1427   Talke like the vulgar sort of Market men,
1428   That come to gather Money for their Corne.
1429   If we haue entrance, as I hope we shall,
1430   And that we finde the slouthfull Watch but weake,
1431   Ile by a signe giue notice to our friends,
1432   That {Charles} the Dolphin may encounter them.
1433  *<S {Souldier}.> Our Sacks shall be a meane to sack the City,
1434   And we be Lords and Rulers ouer Roan,
1435   Therefore wee'le knock.  <D {Knock}.>
1436   <S {Watch}.> {Che la}.
1437   <S {Pucell}.> {Peasauns la pouure gens de Fraunce},
1438   Poore Market folkes that come to sell their Corne.
1439   <S {Watch}.> Enter, goe in, the Market Bell is rung.
1440  *<S {Pucell}.> Now Roan, Ile shake thy Bulwarkes to the
1441   ground.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1442   <D {Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson}.>
1443   <S {Charles}.> Saint {Dennis} blesse this happy Stratageme,
1444   And once againe wee'le sleepe secure in Roan.
1445   <S {Bastard}.> Here entred {Pucell}, and her Practisants:
1446   Now she is there, how will she specifie?
1447   Here is the best and safest passage in.
1448   <S {Reig}.> By thrusting out a Torch from yonder Tower,
1449   Which once discern'd, shewes that her meaning is,
1450   No way to that (for weaknesse) which she entred.
1451   <D {Enter Pucell on the top, thrusting out a}
1452   {Torch burning}.>
1453   <S {Pucell}.> Behold, this is the happy Wedding Torch,
1454   That ioyneth Roan vnto her Countreymen,
1455   But burning fatall to the {Talbonites}.
1456   <S {Bastard}.> See Noble {Charles} the Beacon of our friend,
1457   The burning Torch in yonder Turret stands.
1458   <S {Charles}.> Now shine it like a Commet of Reuenge,
1459   A Prophet to the fall of all our Foes.
1460   <S {Reig}.> Deferre no time, delayes haue dangerous ends,
1461   Enter and cry, the Dolphin, presently,
1462   And then doe execution on the Watch.  <D {Alarum}.>
1463   <D {An Alarum. Talbot in an Excursion}.>

1473  *<S {Pucell}.> God morrow Gallants, want ye Corn for Bread?
1474   I thinke the Duke of Burgonie will fast,
1475   Before hee'le buy againe at such a rate.
1476   'Twas full of Darnell: doe you like the taste?
1477   <S {Burg}.> Scoffe on vile Fiend, and shamelesse Curtizan,
1478   I trust ere long to choake thee with thine owne,
1479   And make thee curse the Haruest of that Corne.
1480  *<S {Charles}.> Your Grace may starue (perhaps) before that
1481   time.
1482  *<S {Bedf}.> Oh let no words, but deedes, reuenge this Trea-son.
1483  _
1484   <S {Pucell}.> What will you doe, good gray- beard?
1485   Breake a Launce, and runne a- Tilt at Death,
1486   Within a Chayre.
1487   <S {Talb}.> Foule Fiend of France, and Hag of all despight,
1488   Incompass'd with thy lustfull Paramours,
1489   Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant Age,
1490   And twit with Cowardise a man halfe dead?
1491   Damsell, Ile haue a bowt with you againe,
1492   Or else let {Talbot} perish with this shame.
1493   <S {Pucell}.> Are ye so hot, Sir: yet {Pucell} hold thy peace,
1494   If {Talbot} doe but Thunder, Raine will follow.
1495   <D {They whisper together in counsell}.>
1496   God speed the Parliament: who shall be the Speaker?
      <P l2v>
1497   <S {Talb}.> Dare yee come forth, and meet vs in the field?
1498  *<S {Pucell}.> Belike your Lordship takes vs then for fooles,
1499   To try if that our owne be ours, or no.
1500   <S {Talb}.> I speake not to that rayling {Hecate},
1501   But vnto thee {Alanson}, and the rest.
1502   Will ye, like Souldiors, come and fight it out?
1503   <S {Alans}.> Seignior no.
1504   <S {Talb}.> Seignior hang: base Muleters of France,
1505   Like Pesant foot- Boyes doe they keepe the Walls,
1506   And dare not take vp Armes, like Gentlemen.
1507   <S {Pucell}.> Away Captaines, let's get vs from the Walls,
1508   For {Talbot} meanes no goodnesse by his Lookes.
1509   God b'uy my Lord, we came but to tell you
1510   That wee are here.  <D {Exeunt from the Walls}.>
1511   <S {Talb}.> And there will we be too, ere it be long,
1512   Or else reproach be {Talbots} greatest fame.
1513   Vow {Burgonie}, by honor of thy House,
1514   Prickt on by publike Wrongs sustain'd in France,
1515   Either to get the Towne againe, or dye.
1516   And I, as sure as English {Henry} liues,
1517   And as his Father here was Conqueror;
1518   As sure as in this late betrayed Towne,
1519   Great {Cordelions} Heart was buryed;
1520   So sure I sweare, to get the Towne, or dye.
1521  *<S {Burg}.> My Vowes are equall partners with thy
1522   Vowes.
1523   <S {Talb}.> But ere we goe, regard this dying Prince,
1524   The valiant Duke of Bedford: Come my Lord,
1525   We will bestow you in some better place,
1526   Fitter for sicknesse, and for crasie age.
1527   <S {Bedf}.> Lord {Talbot}, doe not so dishonour me:
1528   Here will I sit, before the Walls of Roan,
1529   And will be partner of your weale or woe.
1530  *<S {Burg}.> Couragious {Bedford}, let vs now perswade you.
1531   <S {Bedf}.> Not to be gone from hence: for once I read,
1532   That stout {Pendragon}, in his Litter sick,
1533   Came to the field, and vanquished his foes.
1534   Me thinkes I should reuiue the Souldiors hearts,
1535   Because I euer found them as my selfe.
1536   <S {Talb}.> Vndaunted spirit in a dying breast,
1537   Then be it so: Heauens keepe old {Bedford} safe.
1538   And now no more adoe, braue {Burgonie},
1539   But gather we our Forces out of hand,
1540   And set vpon our boasting Enemie.  <D {Exit}.>
1541   <D {An Alarum: Excursions. Enter Sir Iohn}
1542   {Falstaffe, and a Captaine}.>
1543   <S {Capt}.> Whither away Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}, in such haste?
1544   <S {Falst}.> Whither away? to saue my selfe by flight,
1545   We are like to haue the ouerthrow againe.
1546   <S {Capt}.> What? will you flye, and leaue Lord {Talbot}?
1547   <S {Falst}.> #I, all the {Talbots} in the World, to saue my life.
1548   <D {Exit}.>
1549   <S {Capt}.> Cowardly Knight, #ill fortune follow thee.
1550   <D {Exit}.>
1551   <D {Retreat. Excursions. Pucell, Alanson, and}
1552   {Charles flye}.>
1553   <S {Bedf}.> Now quiet Soule, depart when Heauen please,
1554   For I haue seene our Enemies ouerthrow.
1555   What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
1556   They that of late were daring with their scoffes,
1557   Are glad and faine by flight to saue themselues.
1558   <D {#Bedford dyes, and is carryed in by two in his Chaire}.>
1559   <D {An Alarum. Enter Talbot, Burgonie, and}
1560   {the rest}.>
1561   <S {Talb}.> Lost, and recouered in a day againe,
1562   This is a double Honor, {Burgonie}:
1563   Yet Heauens haue glory for this Victorie.
1564   <S {Burg}.> Warlike and Martiall {Talbot}, {Burgonie}
1565   Inshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
1566   Thy noble Deeds, as Valors Monuments.
1567  *<S {Talb}.> Thanks gentle Duke: but where is {Pucel} now?
1568   I thinke her old Familiar is asleepe.
1569  *Now where's the Bastards braues, and {Charles} his glikes?
1570   What all amort? Roan hangs her head for griefe,
1571   That such a valiant Company are fled.
1572   Now will we take some order in the Towne,
1573   Placing therein some expert Officers,
1574   And then depart to Paris, to the King,
1575   For there young {Henry} with his Nobles lye.
1576   <S {Burg}.> What wills Lord {Talbot}, pleaseth {Burgonie}.
1577   <S {Talb}.> But yet before we goe, let's not forget
1578   The Noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd,
1579   But see his Exequies fulfill'd in Roan.
1580   A brauer Souldier neuer couched Launce,
1581   A gentler Heart did neuer sway in Court.
1582   But Kings and mightiest Potentates must die,
1583   For that's the end of humane miserie.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1584   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1585   <D {Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson, Pucell}.>
1586   <S {Pucell}.> Dismay not (Princes) at this accident,
1587   Nor grieue that Roan is so recouered:
1588   Care is no cure, but rather corrosiue,
1589   For things that are not to be remedy'd.
1590   Let frantike {Talbot} triumph for #a while,
1591   And like a Peacock sweepe along his tayle,
1592   Wee'le pull his Plumes, and take away his Trayne,
1593   If Dolphin and the rest will be but rul'd.
1594   <S {Charles}.> We haue been guided by thee hitherto,
1595   And of thy Cunning had no diffidence,
1596   One sudden Foyle shall neuer breed distrust.
1597   <S {Bastard}.> Search out thy wit for secret pollicies,
1598   And we will make thee famous through the World.
1599   <S {Alans}.> Wee'le set thy Statue in some holy place,
1600   And haue thee reuerenc't like a blessed Saint.
1601   Employ thee then, sweet Virgin, for our good.
1602   <S {Pucell}.> Then thus it must be, this doth {Ioane} deuise:
1603   By faire perswasions, mixt with sugred words,
1604   We will entice the Duke of Burgonie
1605   To leaue the {Talbot}, and to follow vs.
1606   <S {Charles}.> #I marry Sweeting, if we could doe that,
1607   France were no place for {Henryes} Warriors,
1608   Nor should that Nation boast it so with vs,
1609   But be extirped from our Prouinces.
1610   <S {Alans}.> For euer should they be expuls'd from France,
1611   And not haue Title of an Earledome here.
1612  *<S {Pucell}.> Your Honors shall perceiue how I will worke,
1613   To bring this matter to the wished end.
1614   <D {Drumme sounds #a farre off}.>
1615   Hearke, by the sound of Drumme you may perceiue
1616   Their Powers are marching vnto Paris- ward.
1617   <D {Here sound an English March}.>
1618   There goes the {Talbot} with his Colours spred,
1619   And all the Troupes of English after him.
      <P l3>
1620   <D {French March}.>
1621   Now in the Rereward comes the Duke and his:
1622   Fortune in fauor makes him lagge behinde.
1623   Summon a Parley, we will talke with him.
1624   <D {Trumpets sound a Parley}.>
1625   <S {Charles}.> A Parley with the Duke of Burgonie.
1626   <S {Burg}.> Who craues a Parley with the Burgonie?
1627  *<S {Pucell}.> The Princely {Charles} of France, thy Countrey-man.
1628  _
1629  *<S {Burg}.> What say'st thou {Charles}? for I am marching
1630   hence.
1631  *<S {Charles}.> Speake {Pucell}, and enchaunt him with thy
1632   words.
1633   <S {Pucell}.> Braue {Burgonie}, vndoubted hope of France,
1634   Stay, let thy humble Hand- maid speake to thee.
1635   <S {Burg}.> Speake on, but be not ouer- tedious.
1636  *<S {Pucell}.> Looke on thy Country, look on fertile France,
1637   And see the Cities and the Townes defac't,
1638   By wasting Ruine of the cruell Foe,
1639   As lookes the Mother on her lowly Babe,
1640   When Death doth close his tender- dying Eyes.
1641   See, see the pining Maladie of France:
1642   Behold the Wounds, the most vnnaturall Wounds,
1643   Which thou thy selfe hast giuen her wofull Brest.
1644   Oh turne thy edged Sword another way,
1645   Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that helpe:
1646  *One drop of Blood drawne from thy Countries Bosome,
1647   Should grieue thee more then streames of forraine gore.
1648   Returne thee therefore with a floud of Teares,
1649   And wash away thy Countries stayned Spots.
1650   <S {Burg}.> Either she hath bewitcht me with her words,
1651   Or Nature makes me suddenly relent.
1652  *<S {Pucell}.> Besides, all French and France exclaimes on thee,
1653   Doubting thy Birth and lawfull Progenie.
1654   Who ioyn'st thou with, but with a Lordly Nation,
1655   That will not trust thee, but for profits sake?
1656   When {Talbot} hath set footing once in France,
1657   And fashion'd thee that Instrument of #Ill,
1658   Who then, but English {Henry}, will be Lord,
1659   And thou be thrust out, like a Fugitiue?
1660   Call we to minde, and marke but this for proofe:
1661   Was not the Duke of Orleance thy Foe?
1662   And was he not in England Prisoner?
1663   But when they heard he was thine Enemie,
1664   They set him free, without his Ransome pay'd,
1665   In spight of {Burgonie} and all his friends.
1666   See then, thou fight'st against thy Countreymen,
1667   And ioyn'st with them will be thy slaughter- men.
1668   Come, come, returne; returne thou wandering Lord,
1669   {#Charles} and the rest will take thee in their armes.
1670   <S {Burg}.> I am vanquished:
1671   These haughtie wordes of hers
1672   Haue batt'red me like roaring Cannon- shot,
1673   And made me almost yeeld vpon my knees.
1674   Forgiue me Countrey, and sweet Countreymen:
1675   And Lords accept this heartie kind embrace.
1676   My Forces and my Power of Men are yours.
1677   So farwell {Talbot}, Ile no longer trust thee.
1678  *<S {Pucell}.> Done like a Frenchman: turne and turne a-gaine.
1679  _
1680  *<S {Charles}.> Welcome braue Duke, thy friendship makes
1681   vs fresh.
1682  *<S {Bastard}.> And doth beget new Courage in our
1683   Breasts.
1684   <S {Alans}.> {Pucell} hath brauely play'd her part in this,
1685   And doth deserue a Coronet of Gold.
1686   <S {Charles}.> Now let vs on, my Lords,
1687   And ioyne our Powers,
1688   And seeke how we may preiudice the Foe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1689   <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>

1691   {Somerset, Warwicke, Exeter: To them, with}

1693   <S {Talb}.> My gracious Prince, and honorable Peeres,
1694   Hearing of your arriuall in this Realme,
1695   I haue #a while giuen Truce vnto my Warres,
1696   To doe my dutie to my Soueraigne.
1697   In signe whereof, this Arme, that hath reclaym'd
1698   To your obedience, fiftie Fortresses,
1699   Twelue Cities, and seuen walled Townes of strength,
1700   Beside fiue hundred Prisoners of esteeme;
1701   Lets fall his Sword before your Highnesse feet:
1702   And with submissiue loyaltie of heart
1703   Ascribes the Glory of his Conquest got,
1704   First to my God, and next vnto your Grace.
1705   <S {King}.> Is this the Lord {Talbot}, Vnckle {Gloucester},
1706   That hath so long beene resident in France?
1707   <S {Glost}.> Yes, if it please your Maiestie, my Liege.
1708  *<S {King}.> Welcome braue Captaine, and victorious Lord.
1709   When I was young (as yet I am not old)
1710   I doe remember how my Father said,
1711   A stouter Champion neuer handled Sword.
1712   Long since we were resolued of your truth,
1713   Your faithfull seruice, and your toyle in Warre:
1714   Yet neuer haue you tasted our Reward,
1715   Or beene reguerdon'd with so much as Thanks,
1716   Because till now, we neuer saw your face.
1717   Therefore stand vp, and for these good deserts,
1718   We here create you Earle of Shrewsbury,
1719   And in our Coronation take your place.
1720   <D {Senet.  Flourish.  Exeunt}.>
1721   <D {Manet Vernon and Basset}.>
1722   <S {Vern}.> Now Sir, to you that were so hot at Sea,
1723   Disgracing of these Colours that I weare,
1724   In honor of my Noble Lord of Yorke
1725   Dar'st thou maintaine the former words thou spak'st?
1726   <S {Bass}.> Yes Sir, as well as you dare patronage
1727   The enuious barking of your sawcie Tongue,
1728   Against my Lord the Duke of Somerset.
1729   <S {Vern}.> Sirrha, thy Lord I honour as he is.
1730   <S {Bass}.> Why, what is he? as good a man as {Yorke}.
1731   <S {Vern}.> Hearke ye: not so: in witnesse take ye that.
1732   <D {Strikes him}.>
1733   <S {Bass}.> Villaine, thou knowest
1734   The Law of Armes is such,
1735   That who so drawes a Sword, 'tis present death,
1736   Or else this Blow should broach thy dearest Bloud.
1737   But Ile vnto his Maiestie, and craue,
1738   I may haue libertie to venge this Wrong,
1739   When thou shalt see, Ile meet thee to thy cost.
1740   <S {Vern}.> Well miscreant, Ile be there as soone as you,
1741   And after meete you, sooner then you would.

1745   Warwicke, Talbot, and Gouernor Exeter}.>
1746   <S {Glo}.> Lord Bishop set the Crowne vpon his head.
1747   <S {Win}.> God saue King {Henry} of that name the sixt.
1748   <S {Glo}.> Now Gouernour of Paris take your oath,
1749   That you elect no other King but him;
1750   Esteeme none Friends, but such as are his Friends,
1751   And none your Foes, but such as shall pretend
1752   Malicious practises against his State:
1753   This shall ye do, so helpe you righteous God.
1754   <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
1755   <S {Fal}.> My gracious Soueraigne, as I rode from Calice,
1756   To haste vnto your Coronation:
1757   A Letter was deliuer'd to my hands,
1758   Writ to your Grace, from th' Duke of Burgundy.
1759   <S {Tal}.> Shame to the Duke of Burgundy, and thee:
1760   I vow'd (base Knight) when I did meete #the next,
1761   To teare the Garter from thy Crauens legge,
1762   Which I haue done, because (vnworthily)
1763   Thou was't installed in that High Degree.
1764   Pardon me Princely {Henry}, and the rest:
1765   This Dastard, at the battell of {Poictiers},
1766   When (but in all) I was sixe thousand strong,
1767   And that the French were almost ten to one,
1768   Before we met, or that a stroke was giuen,
1769   Like to a trustie Squire, did run away.
1770   In which assault, we lost twelue hundred men.
1771   My selfe, and diuers Gentlemen beside,
1772   Were there surpriz'd, and taken prisoners.
1773   Then iudge (great Lords) if I haue done amisse:
1774   Or whether that such Cowards ought to weare
1775   This Ornament of Knighthood, yea or no?
1776   <S {Glo}.> To say the truth, this fact was infamous,
1777   And #ill beseeming any common man;
1778   Much more a Knight, a Captaine, and a Leader.
1779   <S {Tal}.> When first this Order was ordain'd my Lords,
1780   Knights of the Garter were of Noble birth;
1781   Valiant, and Vertuous, full of haughtie Courage,
1782   Such as were growne to credit by the warres:
1783   Not fearing Death, nor shrinking for Distresse,
1784   But alwayes resolute, in most extreames.
1785   He then, that is not furnish'd in this sort,
1786   Doth but vsurpe the Sacred name of Knight,
1787   Prophaning this most Honourable Order,
1788   And should (if I were worthy to be Iudge)
1789   Be quite degraded, like a Hedge- borne Swaine,
1790   That doth presume to boast of Gentle blood.
1791  *<S {K}.> Staine to thy Countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom:
1792   Be packing therefore, thou that was't a knight:
1793   Henceforth we banish thee on paine of death.
1794   And now Lord Protector, view the Letter
1795   Sent from our Vnckle Duke of Burgundy.
1796   <S {Glo}.> What meanes his Grace, that he hath chaung'd
1797   his Stile?
1798   No more but plaine and bluntly? ({To the King}.)
1799   Hath he forgot he is his Soueraigne?
1800   Or doth this churlish Superscription
1801   Pretend some alteration in good #will?
1802   What's heere? {I haue vpon especiall cause},
1803   {Mou'd with compassion of my Countries wracke},
1804   {Together with the pittifull complaints}
1805   {Of such as your oppression feedes vpon},
1806   {Forsaken your pernitious Faction},
1807   {And ioyn'd with Charles, the rightfull king of France}.
1808   O monstrous Treachery: Can this be so?
1809   That in alliance, amity, and oathes,
1810   There should be found such false dissembling guile?
1811   <S {King}.> What? doth my Vnckle Burgundy reuolt?
1812   <S {Glo}.> He doth my Lord, and is become your foe.
1813   <S {King}.> Is that the worst this Letter doth containe?
1814   <S {Glo}.> It is the worst, and all (my Lord) he writes.
1815  *<S {King}.> Why then Lord {Talbot} there shal talk with him,
1816   And giue him chasticement for this abuse.
1817   How say you (my Lord) are you not content?
1818  *<S {Tal}.> Content, my Liege? Yes: But y I am preuented,
1819   I should haue begg'd I might haue bene employd.
1820   <S {King}.> Then gather strength, and march vnto him
1821   straight:
1822   Let him perceiue how #ill we brooke his Treason,
1823   And what offence it is to flout his Friends.
1824   <S {Tal}.> I go my Lord, in heart desiring still
1825   You may behold confusion of your foes.
1826   <D {Enter Vernon and Bassit}.>
1827   <S {Ver}.> Grant me the Combate, gracious Soueraigne.
1828  *<S {Bas}.> And me (my Lord) grant me the Combate too.
1829   <S {Yorke}.> This is my Seruant, heare him Noble Prince.
1830   <S {Som}.> And this is mine (sweet {Henry}) fauour him.
1831  *<S {King}.> Be patient Lords, and giue them leaue to speak.
1832   Say Gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaime,
1833   And wherefore craue you Combate? Or with whom?
1834  *<S {Ver}.> With him (my Lord) for he hath done me wrong.
1835   <S {Bas}.> And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.
1836  *<S {King}.> What is that wrong, wherof you both complain
1837   First let me know, and then Ile answer you.
1838   <S {Bas}.> Crossing the Sea, from England into France,
1839   This Fellow heere with enuious carping tongue,
1840   Vpbraided me about the Rose I weare,
1841   Saying, the sanguine colour of the Leaues
1842   Did represent my Masters blushing cheekes:
1843   When stubbornly he did repugne the truth,
1844   About a certaine question in the Law,
1845   Argu'd betwixt the Duke of Yorke, and him:
1846   With other vile and ignominious tearmes.
1847   In confutation of which rude reproach,
1848   And in defence of my Lords worthinesse,
1849   I craue the benefit of Law of Armes.
1850   <S {Ver}.> And that is my petition (Noble Lord:)
1851   For though he seeme with forged queint conceite
1852   To set a glosse vpon his bold intent,
1853   Yet know (my Lord) I was prouok'd by him,
1854   And he first tooke exceptions at this badge,
1855   Pronouncing that the palenesse of this Flower,
1856   Bewray'd the faintnesse of my Masters heart.
1857   <S {Yorke}.> Will not this malice Somerset be left?
1858  *<S {Som}.> Your priuate grudge my Lord of York, wil out,
1859   Though ne're so cunningly you smother it.
1860  *<S {King}.> Good Lord, what madnesse rules in braine-sicke
1861   men,
1862   When for so slight and friuolous a cause,
1863   Such factious aemulations shall arise?
1864   Good Cosins both of Yorke and Somerset,
1865   Quiet your selues (I pray) and be at peace.
1866   <S {Yorke}.> Let this dissention first be tried by fight,
1867   And then your Highnesse shall command a Peace.
1868   <S {Som}.> The quarrell toucheth none but vs alone,
1869   Betwixt our selues let vs decide it then.
1870   <S {Yorke}.> There is my pledge, accept it Somerset.
1871   <S {Ver}.> Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
      <P l4>
1872   <S {Bass}.> Confirme it so, mine honourable Lord.
1873   <S {Glo}.> Confirme it so? Confounded be your strife,
1874   And perish ye with your audacious prate,
1875   Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham'd
1876   With this immodest clamorous outrage,
1877   To trouble and disturbe the King, and Vs?
1878   And you my Lords, me thinkes you do not well
1879   To beare with their peruerse Obiections:
1880   Much lesse to take occasion from their mouthes,
1881   To raise a mutiny betwixt your selues.
1882   Let me perswade you take a better course.
1883   <S {Exet}.> It greeues his Highnesse,
1884   Good my Lords, be Friends.
1885  *<S {King}.> Come hither you that would be Combatants:
1886   Henceforth I charge you, as you loue our fauour,
1887   Quite to forget this Quarrell, and the cause.
1888   And you my Lords: Remember where we are,
1889   In France, amongst a fickle wauering Nation:
1890   If they perceyue dissention in our lookes,
1891   And that within our selues we disagree;
1892   How will their grudging stomackes be prouok'd
1893   To wilfull Disobedience, and Rebell?
1894   Beside, What infamy will there arise,
1895   When Forraigne Princes shall be certified,
1896   That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
1897   King {Henries} Peeres, and cheefe Nobility,
1898   Destroy'd themselues, and lost the Realme of France?
1899   Oh thinke vpon the Conquest of my Father,
1900   My tender yeares, and let vs not forgoe
1901   That for a trifle, that was bought with blood.
1902   Let me be Vmper in this doubtfull strife:
1903   I see no reason if I weare this Rose,
1904   That any one should therefore be suspitious
1905   I more incline to Somerset, than Yorke:
1906   Both are my kinsmen, and I loue them both.
1907   As well they may vpbray'd me with my Crowne,
1908   Because (forsooth) the King of Scots is Crown'd.
1909   But your discretions better can perswade,
1910   Then I am able to instruct or teach:
1911   And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
1912   So let vs still continue peace, and loue.
1913   Cosin of Yorke, we institute your Grace
1914   To be our Regent in these parts of France:
1915   And good my Lord of Somerset, vnite
1916   Your Troopes of horsemen, with his Bands of foote,
1917   And like true Subiects, sonnes of your Progenitors,
1918   Go cheerefully together, and digest
1919   Your angry Choller on your Enemies.
1920   Our Selfe, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
1921   After some respit, will returne to Calice;
1922   From thence to England, where I hope ere long
1923   To be presented by your Victories,
1924   With {Charles, Alanson}, and that Traiterous rout.
1925   <D {Exeunt. Manet Yorke, Warwick, Exeter, Vernon}.>
1926   <S {War}.> My Lord of Yorke, I promise you the King
1927   Prettily (me thought) did play the Orator.
1928   <S {Yorke}.> And so he did, but yet I like it not,
1929   In that he weares the badge of Somerset.
1930   <S {War}.> Tush, that was but his fancie, blame him not,
1931   I dare presume (sweet Prince) he thought no harme.
1932   <S {York}.> #And if I wish he did. But let it rest,
1933   Other affayres must now be managed.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1934   <D {Flourish. Manet Exeter}.>
1935  *<S {Exet}.> Well didst thou {Richard} to suppresse thy voice:
1936   For had the passions of thy heart burst out,
1937   I feare we should haue seene decipher'd there
1938   More rancorous spight, more furious raging broyles,
1939   Then yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd:
1940   But howsoere, no simple man that sees
1941   This iarring discord of Nobilitie,
1942   This shouldering of each other in the Court,
1943   This factious bandying of their Fauourites,
1944   But that it doth presage some #ill euent.
1945   'Tis much, when Scepters are in Childrens hands:
1946   But more, when Enuy breeds vnkinde deuision,
1947   There comes the ruine, there begins confusion.  <D {Exit}.>
1948   <D {Enter Talbot with Trumpe and Drumme},
1949   {before Burdeaux}.>
1950   <S {Talb}.> Go to the Gates of Burdeaux Trumpeter,
1951   Summon their Generall vnto the Wall.  <D {Sounds}.>
1952   <D {Enter Generall aloft}.>
1953   English {Iohn Talbot} (Captaines) call you forth,
1954   Seruant in Armes to {Harry} King of England,
1955   And thus he would. Open your Citie Gates,
1956   Be humble to vs, call my Soueraigne yours,
1957   And do him homage as obedient Subiects,
1958   And Ile withdraw me, and my bloody power.
1959   But if you frowne vpon this proffer'd Peace,
1960   You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
1961   Leane Famine, quartering Steele, and climbing Fire,
1962   Who in a moment, eeuen with the earth,
1963   Shall lay your stately, and ayre- brauing Towers,
1964   If you forsake the offer of their loue.
1965   <S {Cap}.> Thou ominous and fearefull Owle of death,
1966   Our Nations terror, and their bloody scourge,
1967   The period of thy Tyranny approacheth,
1968   On vs thou canst not enter but by death:
1969   For I protest we are well fortified,
1970   And strong enough to issue out and fight.
1971   If thou retire, the Dolphin well appointed,
1972   Stands with the snares of Warre to tangle thee.
1973   On either hand thee, there are squadrons pitcht,
1974   To wall thee from the liberty of Flight;
1975   And no way canst thou turne thee for redresse,
1976   But death doth front thee with apparant spoyle,
1977   And pale destruction meets thee in the face:
1978   Ten thousand French haue tane the Sacrament,
1979   To ryue their dangerous Artillerie
1980   Vpon no Christian soule but English {Talbot}:
1981   Loe, there thou standst a breathing valiant man
1982   Of an inuincible vnconquer'd spirit:
1983   This is the latest Glorie of thy praise,
1984   That I thy enemy dew thee withall:
1985   For ere the Glasse that now begins to runne,
1986   Finish the processe of his sandy houre,
1987   These eyes that see thee now well coloured,
1988   Shall see thee withered, bloody, pale, and dead.
1989   <D {Drum #a farre off}.>
1990   Harke, harke, the Dolphins drumme, a warning bell,
1991   Sings heauy Musicke to thy timorous soule,
1992   And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.  <D {Exit}>
1993   <S {Tal}.> He Fables not, I heare the enemie:
1994   Out some light Horsemen, and peruse their Wings.
1995   O negligent and heedlesse Discipline,
1996   How are we park'd and bounded in a pale?
1997   A little Heard of Englands timorous Deere,
1998   Maz'd with a yelping kennell of French Curres.
1999   If we be English Deere, be then in blood,
2000   Not Rascall- like to fall downe with a pinch,
2001   But rather moodie mad: And desperate Stagges,
      <P l4v>
2002   Turne on the bloody Hounds with heads of Steele,
2003   And make the Cowards stand aloofe at bay:
2004   Sell euery man his life as deere as mine,
2005   And they shall finde deere Deere of vs my Friends.
2006   God, and S[aint]. {George}, {Talbot} and Englands right,
2007   Prosper our Colours in this dangerous fight.
2008   <D {Enter a Messenger that meets Yorke. Enter Yorke}
2009   {with Trumpet, and many Soldiers}.>
2010   <S {Yorke}.> Are not the speedy scouts return'd againe,
2011   That dog'd the mighty Army of the Dolphin?
2012   <S {Mess}.> They are return'd my Lord, and giue it out,
2013   That he is march'd to Burdeaux with his power
2014   To fight with {Talbot} as he march'd along.
2015   By your espyals were discouered
2016   Two mightier Troopes then that the Dolphin led,
2017   Which ioyn'd with him, and made their march for |(Burdeaux
2018   <S {Yorke}.> A plague vpon that Villaine Somerset,
2019   That thus delayes my promised supply
2020   Of horsemen, that were leuied for this siege.
2021   Renowned {Talbot} doth expect my ayde,
2022   And I am lowted by a Traitor Villaine,
2023   And cannot helpe the noble Cheualier:
2024   God comfort him in this necessity:
2025   If he miscarry, farewell Warres in France.
2026   <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
2027  *<S 2.{Mes}.> Thou Princely Leader of our English strength,
2028   Neuer so needfull on the earth of France,
2029   Spurre to the rescue of the Noble {Talbot},
2030   Who now is girdled with a waste of Iron,
2031   And hem'd about with grim destruction:
2032   To Burdeaux warlike Duke, to Burdeaux Yorke,
2033   Else farwell {Talbot}, France, and Englands honor.
2034   <S {Yorke}.> O God, that Somerset who in proud heart
2035   Doth stop my Cornets, were in {Talbots} place,
2036   So should wee saue a valiant Gentleman,
2037   By forfeyting a Traitor, and a Coward:
2038   Mad ire, and wrathfull fury makes me weepe,
2039   That thus we dye, while remisse Traitors sleepe.
2040   <S {Mes}.> O send some succour to the distrest Lord.
2041  *<S {Yorke}.> He dies, we loose: I breake my warlike word:
2042   We mourne, France smiles: We loose, they dayly get,
2043   All long of this vile Traitor Somerset.
2044  *<S {Mes}.> Then God take mercy on braue {Talbots} soule,
2045   And on his Sonne yong {Iohn}, who two houres since,
2046   I met in trauaile toward his warlike Father;
2047   This seuen yeeres did not {Talbot} see his sonne,
2048   And now they meete where both their liues are done.
2049   <S {Yorke}.> Alas, what ioy shall noble {Talbot} haue,
2050   To bid his yong sonne welcome to his Graue:
2051   Away, vexation almost stoppes my breath,
2052   That sundred friends greete in the houre of death.
2053   {Lucie} farewell, no more my fortune can,
2054   But curse the cause I cannot ayde the man.
2055   {Maine, Bloys, Poytiers}, and {Toures}, are wonne away,
2056   Long all of Somerset, and his delay.  <D {Exit}>
2057   <S {Mes}.> Thus while the Vulture of sedition,
2058   Feedes in the bosome of such great Commanders,
2059   Sleeping neglection doth betray to losse:
2060   The Conquest of our scarse- cold Conqueror,
2061   That euer- liuing man of Memorie,
2062   {Henrie} the fift: Whiles they each other crosse,
2063   Liues, Honours, Lands, and all, hurrie to losse.
2064   <D {Enter Somerset with his Armie}.>
2065   <S {Som}.> It is too late, I cannot send them now:
2066   This expedition was by {Yorke} and {Talbot},
2067   Too rashly plotted. All our generall force,
2068   Might with a sally of the very Towne
2069   Be buckled with: the ouer- daring {Talbot}
2070   Hath sullied all his glosse of former Honor
2071   By this vnheedfull, desperate, wilde aduenture:
2072   {#Yorke} set him on to fight, and dye in shame,
2073   That {Talbot} dead, great {Yorke} might beare the name.
2074   <S {Cap}.> Heere is Sir {William Lucie}, who with me
2075   Set from our ore- matcht forces forth for ayde.
2076  *<S {Som}.> How now Sir {William}, whether were you sent?
2077  *<S {Lu}.> Whether my Lord, from bought & sold L[ord]. {Talbot},
2078   Who ring'd about with bold aduersitie,
2079   Cries out for noble Yorke and Somerset,
2080   To beate assayling death from his weake Regions,
2081   And whiles the honourable Captaine there
2082   Drops bloody swet from his warre- wearied limbes,
2083   And in aduantage lingring lookes for rescue,
2084   You his false hopes, the trust of Englands honor,
2085   Keepe off aloofe with worthlesse emulation:
2086   Let not your priuate discord keepe away
2087   The leuied succours that should lend him ayde,
2088   While he renowned Noble Gentleman
2089   Yeeld vp his life vnto a world of oddes.
2090   Orleance the Bastard, {Charles}, {Burgundie},
2091   {#Alanson}, {Reignard}, compasse him about,
2092   And {Talbot} perisheth by your default.
2093  *<S {Som}.> Yorke set him on, Yorke should haue sent him
2094   ayde.
2095   <S {Luc}.> And Yorke as fast vpon your Grace exclaimes,
2096   Swearing that you with- hold his leuied hoast,
2097   Collected for this expidition.
2098  *<S {Som}.> York lyes: He might haue sent, & had the Horse:
2099   I owe him little Dutie, and lesse Loue,
2100   And take foule scorne to fawne on him by sending.
2101   <S {Lu}.> The fraud of England, not the force of France,
2102   Hath now intrapt the Noble- minded {Talbot}:
2103   Neuer to England shall he beare his life,
2104   But dies betraid to fortune by your strife.
2105  *<S {Som}.> Come go, I will dispatch the Horsemen strait:
2106   Within sixe houres, they will be at his ayde.
2107   <S {Lu}.> Too late comes rescue, he is tane or slaine,
2108   For flye he could not, if he would haue fled:
2109   And flye would {Talbot} neuer though he might.
2110   <S {Som}.> If he be dead, braue {Talbot} then adieu.
2111  *<S {Lu}.> His Fame liues in the world. His Shame in you.
2112   <D {Exeunt}.>
2113   <D {Enter Talbot and his Sonne}.>
2114   <S {Tal}.> O yong {Iohn Talbot}, I did send for thee
2115   To tutor thee in stratagems of Warre,
2116   That {Talbots} name might be in thee reuiu'd,
2117   When saplesse Age, and weake vnable limbes
2118   Should bring thy Father to his drooping Chaire.
2119   But O malignant and ill- boading Starres,
2120   Now thou art come vnto a Feast of death,
2121   A terrible and vnauoyded danger:
2122   Therefore deere Boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
2123   And Ile direct thee how thou shalt escape
2124   By sodaine flight. Come, dally not, be gone.
2125   <S {Iohn}.> Is my name {Talbot}? and am I your Sonne?
      <P l5><C A>
2126   And shall I flye? O, if you loue my Mother,
2127   Dishonor not her Honorable Name,
2128   To make a Bastard, and a Slaue of me:
2129   The World will say, he is not {Talbots} blood,
2130   That basely fled, when Noble {Talbot} stood.
2131   <S {Talb}.> Flye, to reuenge my death, if I be slaine.
2132   <S {Iohn}.> He that flyes so, will ne're returne againe.
2133   <S {Talb}.> If we both stay, we both are sure to dye.
2134   <S {Iohn}.> Then let me stay, and Father doe you flye:
2135   Your losse is great, so your regard should be;
2136   My worth vnknowne, no losse is knowne in me.
2137   Vpon my death, the French can little boast;
2138   In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
2139   Flight cannot stayne the Honor you haue wonne,
2140   But mine it will, that no Exploit haue done.
2141   You fled for Vantage, euery one will sweare:
2142   But if I bow, they'le say it was for feare.
2143   There is no hope that euer I will stay,
2144   If the first howre I shrinke and run away:
2145   Here on my knee I begge Mortalitie,
2146   Rather then Life, preseru'd with Infamie.
2147  *<S {Talb}.> Shall all thy Mothers hopes lye in one Tombe?
2148   <S {Iohn}.> #I, rather then Ile shame my Mothers Wombe.
2149   <S {Talb}.> Vpon my Blessing I command thee goe.
2150   <S {Iohn}.> To fight I will, but not to flye the Foe.
2151   <S {Talb}.> Part of thy Father may be sau'd in thee.
2152   <S {Iohn}.> No part of him, but will be shame in mee.
2153  *<S {Talb}.> Thou neuer hadst Renowne, nor canst not lose it.
2154  *<S {Iohn}.> Yes, your renowned Name: shall flight abuse it?
2155  *<S {Talb}.> Thy Fathers charge shal cleare thee from y staine.
2156   <S {Iohn}.> You cannot witnesse for me, being slaine.
2157   If Death be so apparant, then both flye.
2158  *<S {Talb}.> And leaue my followers here to fight and dye?
2159   My Age was neuer tainted with such shame.
2160  *<S {Iohn}.> And shall my Youth be guiltie of such blame?
2161   No more can I be seuered from your side,
2162   Then can your selfe, your selfe in twaine diuide:
2163   Stay, goe, doe what you will, the like doe I;
2164   For liue I will not, if my Father dye.
2165  *<S {Talb}.> Then here I take my leaue of thee, faire Sonne,
2166   Borne to eclipse thy Life this afternoone:
2167   Come, side by side, together liue and dye,
2168  *And Soule with Soule from France to Heauen flye.  <D {Exit}.>
2169   <D {Alarum: Excursions, wherein Talbots Sonne}
2170   {is hemm'd about, and Talbot}
2171   {rescues him}.>
2172  *<S {Talb}.> Saint {George}, and Victory; fight Souldiers, fight:
2173   The Regent hath with {Talbot} broke his word,
2174   And left vs to the rage of France his Sword.
2175   Where is {Iohn Talbot}? pawse, and take thy breath,
2176   I gaue thee Life, and rescu'd thee from Death.
2177   <S {Iohn}.> O twice my Father, twice am I thy Sonne:
2178   The Life thou gau'st me first, was lost and done,
2179   Till with thy Warlike Sword, despight of Fate,
2180   To my determin'd time thou gau'st new date.
2181  *<S {Talb}.> When fro[m] the {Dolphins} Crest thy Sword struck fire,
2182   It warm'd thy Fathers heart with prowd desire
2183   Of bold- fac't Victorie. Then Leaden Age,
2184   Quicken'd with Youthfull Spleene, and Warlike Rage,
2185   Beat downe {Alanson, Orleance, Burgundie},
2186   And from the Pride of Gallia rescued thee.
2187   The irefull Bastard {Orleance}, that drew blood
2188   From thee my Boy, and had the Maidenhood
2189   Of thy first fight, I soone encountred,
2190   And interchanging blowes, I quickly shed
2191   Some of his Bastard blood, and in disgrace
2192   Bespoke him thus: Contaminated, base,
2193   And mis- begotten blood, I spill of thine,
2194   Meane and right poore, for that pure blood of mine,
2195   Which thou didst force from {Talbot}, my braue Boy.
2196   Here purposing the Bastard to destroy,
2197   Came in strong rescue. Speake thy Fathers care:
2198   Art thou not wearie, {Iohn}? How do'st thou fare?
2199   Wilt thou yet leaue the Battaile, Boy, and flie,
2200   Now thou art seal'd the Sonne of Chiualrie?
2201   Flye, to reuenge my death when I am dead,
2202   The helpe of one stands me in little stead.
2203   Oh, too much folly is it, well I wot,
2204   To hazard all our liues in one small Boat.
2205   If I to day dye not with Frenchmens Rage,
2206   To morrow I shall dye with mickle Age.
2207   By me they nothing gaine, and if I stay,
2208   'Tis but the shortning of my Life one day.
2209   In thee thy Mother dyes, our Households Name,
2210   My Deaths Reuenge, thy Youth, and Englands Fame:
2211   All these, and more, we hazard by thy stay;
2212   All these are sau'd, if thou wilt flye away.
2213   <S {Iohn}.> The Sword of {Orleance} hath not made me smart,
2214   These words of yours draw Life- blood from my Heart.
2215   On that aduantage, bought with such a shame,
2216   To saue a paltry Life, and slay bright Fame,
2217   Before young {Talbot} from old {Talbot} flye,
2218   The Coward Horse that beares me, fall and dye:
2219   And like me to the pesant Boyes of France,
2220   To be Shames scorne, and subiect of Mischance.
2221   Surely, by all the Glorie you haue wonne,
2222   #And if I flye, I am not {Talbots} Sonne.
2223   Then talke no more of flight, it is no boot,
2224   If Sonne to {Talbot}, dye at {Talbots} foot.
2225   <S {Talb}.> Then follow thou thy desp'rate Syre of Creet,
2226   Thou {Icarus}, thy Life to me is sweet:
2227   If thou wilt fight, fight by thy Fathers side,
2228   And commendable prou'd, let's dye in pride.  <D {Exit}.>
2229   <D {Alarum. Excursions. Enter old}
2230   {Talbot led}.>
2231   <S {Talb}.> Where is my other Life? mine owne is gone.
2232   O, where's young {Talbot}? where is valiant {Iohn}?
2233   Triumphant Death, smear'd with Captiuitie,
2234   Young {Talbots} Valour makes me smile at thee.
2235   When he perceiu'd me shrinke, and on my Knee,
2236   His bloodie Sword he brandisht ouer mee,
2237   And like a hungry Lyon did commence
2238   Rough deeds of Rage, and sterne Impatience:
2239   But when my angry Guardant stood alone,
2240   Tendring my ruine, and assayl'd of none,
2241   Dizzie- ey'd Furie, and great rage of Heart,
2242   Suddenly made him from my side to start
2243   Into the clustring Battaile of the French:
2244   And in that Sea of Blood, my Boy did drench
2245   His ouer- mounting Spirit; and there di'de
2246   My {Icarus}, my Blossome, in his pride.
2247   <D {Enter with Iohn Talbot, borne}.>
2248  *<S {Seru}.> O my deare Lord, loe where your Sonne is borne.
2249  *<S {Tal}.> Thou antique Death, which laugh'st vs here to scorn,
2250   Anon from thy insulting Tyrannie,
2251   Coupled in bonds of perpetuitie,
2252   Two {Talbots} winged through the lither Skie,
2253   In thy despight shall scape Mortalitie.
      <P l5v><C B>
2254   O thou whose wounds become hard fauoured death,
2255   Speake to thy father, ere thou yeeld thy breath,
2256   Braue death by speaking, whither he will or no:
2257   Imagine him a Frenchman, and thy Foe.
2258   Poore Boy, he smiles, me thinkes, as who should say,
2259   Had Death bene French, then Death had dyed to day.
2260   Come, come, and lay him in his Fathers armes,
2261   My spirit can no longer beare these harmes.
2262   Souldiers adieu: I haue what I would haue,
2263   Now my old armes are yong {Iohn Talbots} graue.  <D {Dyes}>
2264   <D {Enter Charles, Alanson, Burgundie, Bastard},
2265   {and Pucell}.>
2266   <S {Char}.> Had Yorke and Somerset brought rescue in,
2267   We should haue found a bloody day of this.
2268  *<S {Bast}.> How the yong whelpe of {Talbots} raging wood,
2269   Did flesh his punie- sword in Frenchmens blood.
2270   <S {Puc}.> Once I encountred him, and thus I said:
2271   Thou Maiden youth, be vanquisht by a Maide.
2272   But with a proud Maiesticall high scorne
2273   He answer'd thus: Yong {Talbot} was not borne
2274   To be the pillage of a Giglot Wench:
2275   So rushing in the bowels of the French,
2276   He left me proudly, as vnworthy fight.
2277  *<S {Bur}.> Doubtlesse he would haue made a noble Knight:
2278   See where he lyes inherced in the armes
2279   Of the most bloody Nursser of his harmes.
2280  *<S {Bast}.> Hew them to peeces, hack their bones assunder,
2281   Whose life was Englands glory, Gallia's wonder.
2282   <S {Char}.> Oh no forbeare: For that which we haue fled
2283   During the life, let vs not wrong it dead.
2284   <D {Enter Lucie}.>
2285   <S {Lu}.> Herald, conduct me to the Dolphins Tent,
2286   To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day.
2287   <S {Char}.> On what submissiue message art thou sent?
2288  *<S {Lucy}.> Submission Dolphin? Tis a meere French word:
2289   We English Warriours wot not what it meanes.
2290   I come to know what Prisoners thou hast tane,
2291   And to suruey the bodies of the dead.
2292   <S {Char}.> For prisoners askst thou? #Hell our prison is.
2293   But tell me whom thou seek'st?
2294   <S {Luc}.> But where's the great Alcides of the field,
2295   Valiant Lord {Talbot} Earle of Shrewsbury?
2296   Created for his rare successe in Armes,
2297   Great Earle of {Washford}, {Waterford}, and {Valence},
2298   Lord {Talbot} of {Goodrig} and {Vrchinfield},
2299   Lord {Strange} of {Blackmere}, Lord {Verdon} of {Alton},
2300   Lord {Cromwell} of {Wingefield}, Lord {Furniuall} of {Sheffeild},
2301   The thrice victorious Lord of {Falconbridge},
2302   Knight of the Noble Order of {S[aint]. George},
2303   Worthy S[aint]. {Michael}, and the {Golden Fleece},
2304   Great Marshall to {Henry} the sixt,
2305   Of all his Warres within the Realme of France.
2306   <S {Puc}.> Heere's a silly stately stile indeede:
2307   The Turke that two and fiftie Kingdomes hath,
2308   Writes not so tedious a Stile as this.
2309   Him that thou magnifi'st with all these Titles,
2310   Stinking and fly- blowne lyes heere at our feete.
2311  *<S {Lucy}.> Is {Talbot} slaine, the Frenchmens only Scourge,
2312   Your Kingdomes terror, and blacke {Nemesis}?
2313   Oh were mine eye- balles into Bullets turn'd,
2314   That I in rage might shoot them at your faces.
2315   Oh, that I could but call these dead to life,
2316   It were enough to fright the Realme of France.
2317   Were but his Picture left amongst you here,
2318   It would amaze the prowdest of you all.
2319   Giue me their Bodyes, that I may beare them hence,
2320   And giue them Buriall, as beseemes their worth.
2321   <S {Pucel}.> I thinke this vpstart is old {Talbots} Ghost,
2322   He speakes with such a proud commanding spirit:
2323   For Gods sake let him haue him, to keepe them here,
2324   They would but stinke, and putrifie the ayre.
2325   <S {Char}.> Go take their bodies hence.
2326  *<S {Lucy}.> Ile beare them hence: but from their ashes shal
2327   be reard
2328   A Phoenix that shall make all France affear'd.
2329  *<S {Char}.> So we be rid of them, do with him what y wilt.
2330   And now to Paris in this conquering vaine,
2331   All will be ours, now bloody {Talbot}s slaine.  <D {Exit}.>
2332   <Z {Scena secunda}.>
2333   <D {SENNET}.>
2334   <D {Enter King, Glocester, and Exeter}.>
2335   <S {King}.> Haue you perus'd the Letters from the Pope,
2336   The Emperor, and the Earle of Arminack?
2337   <S {Glo}.> I haue my Lord, and their intent is this,
2338   They humbly sue vnto your Excellence,
2339   To haue a godly peace concluded of,
2340   Betweene the Realmes of England, and of France.
2341   <S {King}.> How doth your Grace affect their motion?
2342   <S {Glo}.> Well (my good Lord) and as the only meanes
2343   To stop effusion of our Christian blood,
2344   And stablish quietnesse on euery side.
2345   <S {King}.> #I marry Vnckle, for I alwayes thought
2346   It was both impious and vnnaturall,
2347   That such immanity and bloody strife
2348   Should reigne among Professors of one Faith.
2349   <S {Glo}.> Beside my Lord, the sooner to effect,
2350   And surer binde this knot of amitie,
2351   The Earle of Arminacke neere knit to {Charles},
2352   A man of great Authoritie in France,
2353   Proffers his onely daughter to your Grace,
2354   In marriage, with a large and sumptuous Dowrie.
2355   <S {King}.> Marriage Vnckle? Alas my yeares are yong:
2356   And fitter is my studie, and my Bookes,
2357   Then wanton dalliance with a Paramour.
2358   Yet call th' Embassadors, and as you please,
2359   So let them haue their answeres euery one:
2360   I shall be well content with any choyce
2361   Tends to Gods glory, and my Countries weale.
2362   <D {Enter Winchester, and three Ambassadors}.>
2363   <S {Exet}.> What, is my Lord of {Winchester} install'd,
2364   And call'd vnto a Cardinalls degree?
2365   Then I perceiue, that will be verified
2366   {Henry} the Fift did sometime prophesie.
2367   If once he come to be a Cardinall,
2368   Hee'l make his cap coequall with the Crowne.
2369   <S {King}.> My Lords Ambassadors, your seuerall suites
2370   Haue bin consider'd and debated on,
2371   Your purpose is both good and reasonable:
2372   And therefore are we certainly resolu'd,
2373   To draw conditions of a friendly peace,
      <P l6>
2374   Which by my Lord of Winchester we meane
2375   Shall be transported presently to France.
2376   <S {Glo}.> And for the proffer of my Lord your Master,
2377   I haue inform'd his Highnesse so at large,
2378   As liking of the Ladies vertuous gifts,
2379   Her Beauty, and the valew of her Dower,
2380   He doth intend she shall be Englands Queene.
2381   <S {King}.> In argument and proofe of which contract,
2382   Beare her this Iewell, pledge of my affection.
2383   And so my Lord Protector see them guarded,
2384   And safely brought to {Douer}, wherein ship'd
2385   Commit them to the fortune of the sea.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2386   <S {Win}.> Stay my Lord Legate, you shall first receiue
2387   The summe of money which I promised
2388   Should be deliuered to his Holinesse,
2389   For cloathing me in these graue Ornaments.
2390   <S {Legat}.> I will attend vpon your Lordships leysure.
2391   <S {Win}.> Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,
2392   Or be inferiour to the proudest Peere;
2393   {Humfrey} of Gloster, thou shalt well perceiue,
2394   That neither in birth, or for authoritie,
2395   The Bishop will be ouer- borne by thee:
2396   Ile either make thee stoope, and bend thy knee,
2397   Or sacke this Country with a mutiny.  <D {Exeunt}>
2398   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
2399   <D {Enter Charles, Burgundy, Alanson, Bastard},
2400   {Reignier, and Ione}.>
2401  *<S {Char}.> These newes (my Lords) may cheere our droo-ping
2402   spirits:
2403   'Tis said, the stout Parisians do reuolt,
2404   And turne againe vnto the warlike French.
2405   <S {Alan}.> Then march to Paris Royall {Charles} of France,
2406   And keepe not backe your powers in dalliance.
2407   <S {Pucel}.> Peace be amongst them if they turne to vs,
2408   Else ruine combate with their Pallaces.
2409   <D {Enter Scout}.>
2410   <S {Scout}.> Successe vnto our valiant Generall,
2411   And happinesse to his accomplices.
2412  *<S {Char}.> What tidings send our Scouts? I prethee speak.
2413   <S {Scout}.> The English Army that diuided was
2414   Into two parties, is now conioyn'd in one,
2415   And meanes to giue you battell presently.
2416   <S {Char}.> Somewhat too sodaine Sirs, the warning is,
2417   But we will presently prouide for them.
2418   <S {Bur}.> I trust the Ghost of {Talbot} is not there:
2419   Now he is gone my Lord, you neede not feare.
2420   <S {Pucel}.> Of all base passions, Feare is most accurst.
2421   Command the Conquest {Charles}, it shall be thine:
2422   Let {Henry} fret, and all the world repine.
2423   <S {Char}.> Then on my Lords, and France be fortunate.
2424   <D {Exeunt. Alarum. Excursions}.>
2425   <D {Enter Ione de Pucell}.>
2426   <S {Puc}.> The Regent conquers, and the Frenchmen flye.
2427   Now helpe ye charming Spelles and Periapts,
2428   And ye choise spirits that admonish me,
2429   And giue me signes of future accidents.  <D {Thunder}.>
2430   You speedy helpers, that are substitutes
2431   Vnder the Lordly Monarch of the North,
2432   Appeare, and ayde me in this enterprize.
2433   <D {Enter Fiends}.>
2434   This speedy and quicke appearance argues proofe
2435   Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
2436   Now ye Familiar Spirits, that are cull'd
2437   Out of the powerfull Regions vnder earth,
2438   Helpe me this once, that France may get the field.
2439   <D {They walke, and speake not}.>
2440   Oh hold me not with silence ouer- long:
2441   Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
2442   Ile lop a member off, and giue it you,
2443   In earnest of a further benefit:
2444   So you do condiscend to helpe me now.
2445   <D {They hang their heads}.>
2446   No hope to haue redresse? My body shall
2447   Pay recompence, if you will graunt my suite.
2448   <D {They shake their heads}.>
2449   Cannot my body, nor blood- sacrifice,
2450   Intreate you to your wonted furtherance?
2451   Then take my soule; my body, soule, and all,
2452   Before that England giue the French the foyle.
2453   <D {They depart}.>
2454   See, they forsake me. Now the time is come,
2455   That France must vale her lofty plumed Crest,
2456   And let her head fall into Englands lappe.
2457   My ancient Incantations are too weake,
2458   And #hell too strong for me to buckle with:
2459   Now France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.  <D {Exit}.>
2460   <D {Excursions. Burgundie and Yorke fight hand to}
2461   {hand. French flye}.>
2462   <S {Yorke}.> Damsell of France, I thinke I haue you fast,
2463   Vnchaine your spirits now with spelling Charmes,
2464   And try if they can gaine your liberty.
2465   A goodly prize, fit for the diuels grace.
2466   See how the vgly Witch doth bend her browes,
2467   As if with {Circe}, she would change my shape.
2468   <S {Puc}.> Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be:
2469   <S {Yor}.> Oh, {Charles} the Dolphin is a proper man,
2470   No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
2471  *<S {Puc}.> A plaguing mischeefe light on {Charles}, and thee,
2472   And may ye both be sodainly surpriz'd
2473   By bloudy hands, in sleeping on your beds.
2474   <S {Yorke}.> Fell banning Hagge, Inchantresse hold thy
2475   tongue.
2476   <S {Puc}.> I prethee giue me leaue to curse awhile.
2477  *<S {Yorke}.> Curse Miscreant, when thou comst to the stake
2478   <D {Exeunt}.>
2479   <D {Alarum. Enter Suffolke with Margaret}
2480   {in his hand}.>
2481   <S {Suff}.> Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
2482   <D {Gazes on her}.>
2483   Oh Fairest Beautie, do not feare, nor flye:
2484   For I will touch thee but with reuerend hands,
2485   I kisse these fingers for eternall peace,
2486   And lay them gently on thy tender side.
2487   Who art thou, say? that I may honor thee.
2488   <S {Mar}.> {Margaret} my name, and daughter to a King,
2489   The King of Naples, who so ere thou art.
2490   <S {Suff}.> An Earle I am, and Suffolke am I call'd.
2491   Be not offended Natures myracle,
2492   Thou art alotted to be tane by me:
2493   So doth the Swan her downie Signets saue,
      <P l6v>
2494   Keeping them prisoner vnderneath his wings:
2495   Yet if this seruile vsage once offend,
2496   Go, and be free againe, as Suffolkes friend.  <D {She is going}>
2497   Oh stay: I haue no power to let her passe,
2498   My hand would free her, but my heart sayes no.
2499   As playes the Sunne vpon the glassie streames,
2500   Twinkling another counterfetted beame,
2501   So seemes this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
2502   Faine would I woe her, yet I dare not speake:
2503   Ile call for Pen and Inke, and write my minde:
2504   Fye {De la Pole}, disable not thy selfe:
2505   Hast not a Tongue? Is she not heere?
2506   Wilt thou be daunted at a Womans sight?
2507   #I: Beauties Princely Maiesty is such,
2508   'Confounds the tongue, and makes the senses rough.
2509   <S {Mar}.> Say Earle of Suffolke, if thy name be so,
2510   What ransome must I pay before I passe?
2511   For I perceiue I am thy prisoner.
2512   <S {Suf}.> How canst thou tell she will deny thy suite,
2513   Before thou make a triall of her loue?
2514  *<S {M}.> Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I pay?
2515   <S {Suf}.> She's beautifull; and therefore to be Wooed:
2516   She is a Woman; therefore to be Wonne.
2517   <S {Mar,}> Wilt thou accept of ransome, yea or no?
2518   <S {Suf}.> Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife,
2519   Then how can {Margaret} be thy Paramour?
2520   <S {Mar}.> I were best to leaue him, for he will not heare.
2521   <S {Suf}.> There all is marr'd: there lies a cooling card.
2522   <S {Mar}.> He talkes at randon: sure the man is mad.
2523   <S {Suf}.> And yet a dispensation may bee had.
2524   <S {Mar}.> And yet I would that you would answer me.
2525   <S {Suf}.> Ile win this Lady {Margaret}. For whom?
2526   Why for my King: Tush, that's a woodden thing.
2527   <S {Mar}.> He talkes of wood: It is some Carpenter.
2528   <S {Suf}.> Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
2529   And peace established betweene these Realmes.
2530   But there remaines a scruple in that too:
2531   For though her Father be the King of {Naples},
2532   Duke of {Aniou} and {Mayne}, yet is he poore,
2533   And our Nobility will scorne the match.
2534   <S {Mar}.> Heare ye Captaine? Are you not at leysure?
2535   <S {Suf}.> It shall be so, disdaine they ne're so much:
2536   <S {Henry}> is youthfull, and will quickly yeeld.
2537   Madam, I haue a secret to reueale.
2538  *<S {Mar}.> What though I be inthral'd, he seems a knight
2539   And will not any way dishonor me.
2540   <S {Suf}.> Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
2541   <S {Mar}.> Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French,
2542   And then I need not craue his curtesie.
2543   <S {Suf}.> Sweet Madam, giue me hearing in a cause.
2544   <S {Mar}.> Tush, women haue bene captiuate ere now.
2545   <S {Suf}.> Lady, wherefore talke you so?
2546   <S {Mar}.> I cry you mercy, 'tis but {Quid} for {Quo}.
2547   <S {Suf}.> Say gentle Princesse, would you not suppose
2548   Your bondage happy, to be made a Queene?
2549   <S {Mar}.> To be a Queene in bondage, is more vile,
2550   Than is a slaue, in base seruility:
2551   For Princes should be free.
2552   <S {Suf}.> And so shall you,
2553   If happy Englands Royall King be free.
2554  *<S {Mar}.> Why what concernes his freedome vnto mee?
2555   <S {Suf}.> Ile vndertake to make thee {Henries} Queene,
2556   To put a Golden Scepter in thy hand,
2557   And set a precious Crowne vpon thy head,
2558   If thou wilt condiscend to be my===
2559   <S {Mar}.> What?
2560   <S {Suf}.> His loue.
2561   <S {Mar}.> I am vnworthy to be {Henries} wife.
2562   <S {Suf}.> No gentle Madam, I vnworthy am
2563   To woe so faire a Dame to be his wife,
2564   And haue no portion in the choice my selfe.
2565   How say you Madam, are ye so content?
2566   <S {Mar}.> #And if my Father please, I am content.
2567  *<S {Suf}.> Then call our Captaines and our Colours forth,
2568   And Madam, at your Fathers Castle walles,
2569   Wee'l craue a parley, to conferre with him.
2570   <D {Sound. Enter Reignier on the Walles}.>
2571   See {Reignier} see, thy daughter prisoner.
2572   <S {Reig}.> To whom?
2573   <S {Suf}.> To me.
2574   <S {Reig}.> Suffolke, what remedy?
2575   I am a Souldier, and vnapt to weepe,
2576   Or to exclaime on Fortunes ficklenesse.
2577   <S {Suf}.> Yes, there is remedy enough my Lord,
2578   Consent, and for thy Honor giue consent,
2579   Thy daughter shall be wedded to my King,
2580   Whom I with paine haue wooed and wonne thereto:
2581   And this her easie held imprisonment,
2582   Hath gain'd thy daughter Princely libertie.
2583   <S {Reig}.> Speakes Suffolke as he thinkes?
2584   <S {Suf}.> Faire {Margaret} knowes,
2585   That Suffolke doth not flatter, face, or faine.
2586   <S {Reig}.> Vpon thy Princely warrant, I descend,
2587   To giue thee answer of thy iust demand.
2588   <S {Suf}.> And heere I will expect thy comming.
2589   <D {Trumpets sound. Enter Reignier}.>
2590   <S {Reig}.> Welcome braue Earle into our Territories,
2591   Command in {Aniou} what your Honor pleases.
2592   <S {Suf}.> Thankes {Reignier}, happy for so sweet a Childe,
2593   Fit to be made companion with a King:
2594   What answer makes your Grace vnto my suite?
2595   <S {Reig}.> Since thou dost daigne to woe her little worth,
2596   To be the Princely Bride of such a Lord:
2597   Vpon condition I may quietly
2598   Enioy mine owne, the Country {Maine} and {Aniou},
2599   Free from oppression, or the stroke of Warre,
2600   My daughter shall be {Henries}, if he please.
2601   <S {Suf}.> That is her ransome, I deliuer her,
2602   And those two Counties I will vndertake
2603   Your Grace shall well and quietly enioy.
2604   <S {Reig}.> And I againe in {Henries} Royall name,
2605   As Deputy vnto that gracious King,
2606   Giue thee her hand for signe of plighted faith.
2607   <S {Suf}.> {Reignier} of France, I giue thee Kingly thankes,
2608   Because this is in Trafficke of a King.
2609   And yet me thinkes I could be well content
2610   To be mine owne Atturney in this case.
2611   Ile ouer then to England with this newes.
2612   And make this marriage to be solemniz'd:
2613   So farewell {Reignier}, set this Diamond safe
2614   In Golden Pallaces as it becomes.
2615   <S {Reig}.> I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
2616   The Christian Prince King {Henrie} were he heere.
2617  *<S {Mar}.> Farewell my Lord, good wishes, praise, & praiers,
2618   Shall Suffolke euer haue of {Margaret}.  <D {Shee is going}.>
2619  *<S {Suf}.> Farwell sweet Madam: but hearke you {Margaret},
2620   No Princely commendations to my King?
2621   <S {Mar}.> Such commendations as becomes a Maide,
2622   A Virgin, and his Seruant, say to him.
2623   <S {Suf}.> Words sweetly plac'd, and modestie directed,
      <P m1>
2624   But Madame, I must trouble you againe,
2625   No louing Token to his Maiestie?
2626   <S {Mar}.> Yes, my good Lord, a pure vnspotted heart,
2627   Neuer yet taint with loue, I send the King.
2628   <S {Suf}.> And this withall.  <D {Kisse her}.>
2629   <S {Mar}.> That for thy selfe, I will not so presume,
2630   To send such peeuish tokens to a King.
2631   <S {Suf}.> Oh wert thou for my selfe: but {Suffolke} stay,
2632   Thou mayest not wander in that Labyrinth,
2633   There Minotaurs and vgly Treasons lurke,
2634   Solicite {Henry} with her wonderous praise.
2635   Bethinke thee on her Vertues that surmount,
2636   Mad naturall Graces that extinguish #Art,
2637   Repeate their semblance often on the Seas,
2638   That when thou com'st to kneele at {Henries} feete,
2639   Thou mayest bereaue him of his wits with wonder.  <D {Exit}>
2640   <D {Enter Yorke, Warwicke, Shepheard, Pucell}.>
2641  *<S {Yor}.> Bring forth that Sorceresse condemn'd to burne.
2642   <S {Shep}.> Ah {Ione}, this kils thy Fathers heart out- right,
2643   Haue I sought euery Country farre and neere,
2644   And now it is my chance to finde thee out,
2645   Must I behold thy timelesse cruell death:
2646   Ah {Ione}, sweet daughter {Ione}, Ile die with thee.
2647   <S {Pucel}.> Decrepit Miser, base ignoble Wretch,
2648   I am am descended of a gentler blood.
2649   Thou art no Father, nor no Friend of mine.
2650  *<S {Shep}.> Out, out: My Lords, #and please you, 'tis not so
2651   I did beget her, all the Parish knowes:
2652   Her Mother liueth yet, can testifie
2653   She was the first fruite of my Bach'ler- ship.
2654   <S {War}.> Gracelesse, wilt thou deny thy Parentage?
2655  *<S {Yorke}.> This argues what her kinde of life hath beene,
2656   Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes.
2657   <S {Shep}.> Fye {Ione}, that thou wilt be so obstacle:
2658   God knowes, thou art a collop of my flesh,
2659   And for thy sake haue I shed many a teare:
2660   Deny me not, I prythee, gentle {Ione}.
2661   <S {Pucell}.> Pezant auant. You haue suborn'd this man
2662   Of purpose, to obscure my Noble birth.
2663   <S {Shep}.> 'Tis true, I gaue a Noble to the Priest,
2664   The morne that I was wedded to her mother.
2665   Kneele downe and take my blessing, good my Gyrle.
2666   Wilt thou not stoope? Now cursed be the time
2667   Of thy natiuitie: I would the Milke
2668   Thy mother gaue thee when thou suck'st her brest,
2669   Had bin a little Rats- bane for thy sake.
2670   Or else, when thou didst keepe my Lambes a- field,
2671   I wish some rauenous Wolfe had eaten thee.
2672   Doest thou deny thy Father, cursed Drab?
2673   O burne her, burne her, hanging is too good.  <D {Exit}.>
2674   <S {Yorke}.> Take her away, for she hath liu'd too long,
2675   To fill the world with vicious qualities.
2676  *<S {Puc}.> First let me tell you whom you haue condemn'd;
2677   Not me, begotten of a Shepheard Swaine,
2678   But issued from the Progeny of Kings.
2679   Vertuous and Holy, chosen from aboue,
2680   By inspiration of Celestiall Grace,
2681   To worke exceeding myracles on earth.
2682   I neuer had to do with wicked Spirits.
2683   But you that are polluted with your lustes,
2684   Stain'd with the guiltlesse blood of Innocents,
2685   Corrupt and tainted with a thousand Vices:
2686   Because you want the grace that others haue,
2687   You iudge it straight a thing impossible
2688   To compasse Wonders, but by helpe of diuels.
2689   No misconceyued, {Ione} of {Aire} hath beene
2690   A Virgin from her tender infancie,
2691   Chaste, and immaculate in very thought,
2692   Whose Maiden- blood thus rigorously effus'd,
2693   Will cry for Vengeance, at the Gates of Heauen.
2694   <S {Yorke}.> #I, #I: away with her to execution.
2695   <S {War}.> And hearke ye sirs: because she is a Maide,
2696   Spare for no Faggots, let there be enow:
2697   Place barrelles of pitch vpon the fatall stake,
2698   That so her torture may be shortned.
2699   <S {Puc}.> Will nothing turne your vnrelenting hearts?
2700   Then {Ione} discouer thine infirmity,
2701   That warranteth by Law, to be thy priuiledge.
2702   I am with childe ye bloody Homicides:
2703   Murther not then the Fruite within my Wombe,
2704   Although ye hale me to a violent death.
2705  *<S {Yor}.> Now heauen forfend, the holy Maid with child?
2706   <S {War}.> The greatest miracle that ere ye wrought.
2707   Is all your strict precisenesse come to this?
2708   <S {Yorke}.> She and the Dolphin haue bin iugling,
2709   I did imagine what would be her refuge.
2710   <S {War}.> Well go #too, #we'll haue no Bastards liue,
2711   Especially since {Charles} must Father it.
2712   <S {Puc}.> You are deceyu'd, my childe is none of his,
2713   It was {Alanson} that inioy'd my loue.
2714   <S {Yorke}.> {Alanson} that notorious Macheuile?
2715   It dyes, #and if it had a thousand liues.
2716   <S {Puc}.> Oh giue me leaue, I haue deluded you,
2717   'Twas neyther {Charles}, nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
2718   But {Reignier} King of {Naples} that preuayl'd.
2719   <S {War}.> A married man, that's most intollerable.
2720  *<S {Yor}.> Why here's a Gyrle: I think she knowes not wel
2721   (There were so many) whom she may accuse.
2722   <S {War}.> It's signe she hath beene liberall and free.
2723   <S {Yor}.> And yet forsooth she is a Virgin pure.
2724   Strumpet, thy words condemne thy Brat, and thee.
2725   Vse no intreaty, for it is in vaine.
2726  *<S {Pu}.> Then lead me hence: with whom I leaue my curse.
2727   May neuer glorious Sunne reflex his beames
2728   Vpon the Countrey where you make abode:
2729   But darknesse, and the gloomy shade of death
2730   Inuiron you, till Mischeefe and Dispaire,
2731  *Driue you to break your necks, or hang your selues.  <D {Exit}>
2732   <D {Enter Cardinall}.>
2733   <S {Yorke}.> Breake thou in peeces, and consume to ashes,
2734   Thou fowle accursed minister of #Hell.
2735   <S {Car}.> Lord Regent, I do greete your Excellence
2736   With Letters of Commission from the King.
2737   For know my Lords, the States of Christendome,
2738   Mou'd with remorse of these out- ragious broyles,
2739   Haue earnestly implor'd a generall peace,
2740   Betwixt our Nation, and the aspyring French;
2741   And heere at hand, the Dolphin and his Traine
2742   Approacheth, to conferre about some matter.
2743   <S {Yorke}.> Is all our trauell turn'd to this effect,
2744   After the slaughter of so many Peeres,
2745   So many Captaines, Gentlemen, and Soldiers,
2746   That in this quarrell haue beene ouerthrowne,
2747   And sold their bodyes for their Countryes benefit,
2748   Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
2749   Haue we not lost most part of all the Townes,
2750   By Treason, Falshood, and by Treacherie,
2751   Our great Progenitors had conquered:
2752   Oh Warwicke, Warwicke, I foresee with greefe
2753   The vtter losse of all the Realme of France.
2754   <S {War}.> Be patient Yorke, if we conclude a Peace
      <P m1v>
2755   It shall be with such strict and seuere Couenants,
2756   As little shall the Frenchmen gaine thereby.
2757   <D {Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier}.>
2758   <S {Char}.> Since Lords of England, it is thus agreed,
2759   That peacefull truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
2760   We come to be informed by your selues,
2761   What the conditions of that league must be.
2762   <S {Yorke}.> Speake Winchester, for boyling choller chokes
2763   The hollow passage of my poyson'd voyce,
2764   By sight of these our balefull enemies.
2765   <S {Win}.> {Charles}, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
2766   That in regard King {Henry} giues consent,
2767   Of meere compassion, and of lenity,
2768   To ease your Countrie of distressefull Warre,
2769   And suffer you to breath in fruitfull peace,
2770   You shall become true Liegemen to his Crowne.
2771   And {Charles}, vpon condition thou wilt sweare
2772   To pay him tribute, and submit thy selfe,
2773   Thou shalt be plac'd as Viceroy vnder him,
2774   And still enioy thy Regall dignity.
2775   <S {Alan}.> Must he be then as shadow of himselfe?
2776   Adorne his Temples with a Coronet,
2777   And yet in substance and authority,
2778   Retaine but priuiledge of a priuate man?
2779   This proffer is  absurd, and reasonlesse.
2780   <S {Char}.> 'Tis knowne already that I am possest
2781   With more then halfe the Gallian Territories,
2782   And therein reuerenc'd for their lawfull King.
2783   Shall I for lucre of the rest vn- vanquisht,
2784   Detract so much from that prerogatiue,
2785   As to be call'd but Viceroy of the whole?
2786   No Lord Ambassador, Ile rather keepe
2787   That which I haue, than coueting for more
2788   Be cast from possibility of all.
2789   <S {Yorke}.> Insulting {Charles}, hast thou by secret meanes
2790   Vs'd intercession to obtaine a league,
2791   And now the matter growes to compremize,
2792   Stand'st thou aloofe vpon Comparison.
2793   Either accept the Title thou vsurp'st,
2794   Of benefit proceeding from our King,
2795   And not of any challenge of Desert,
2796   Or we will plague thee with incessant Warres.
2797   <S {Reig}.> My Lord, you do not well in obstinacy,
2798   To cauill in the course of this Contract:
2799   If once it be neglected, ten to one
2800   We shall not finde like opportunity.
2801   <S {Alan}.> To say the truth, it is your policie,
2802   To saue your Subiects from such massacre
2803   And ruthlesse slaughters as are dayly seene
2804   By our proceeding in Hostility,
2805   And therefore take this compact of a Truce,
2806   Although you breake it, when your pleasure serues.
2807   <S {War}.> How sayst thou {Charles}?
2808   Shall our Condition stand?
2809   <S {Char}.> It Shall:
2810   Onely reseru'd, you claime no interest
2811   In any of our Townes of Garrison.
2812   <S {Yor}.> Then sweare Allegeance to his Maiesty,
2813   As thou art Knight, neuer to disobey,
2814   Nor be Rebellious to the Crowne of England,
2815   Thou nor thy Nobles, to the Crowne of England.
2816   So, now dismisse your Army when ye please:
2817   Hang vp your Ensignes, let your Drummes be still,
2818   For heere we entertaine a solemne peace.  <D {Exeunt}>
2819   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2820   <D {Enter Suffolke in conference with the King},
2821   {Glocester, and Exeter}.>
2822  *<S {King}.> Your wondrous rare description (noble Earle)
2823   Of beauteous {Margaret} hath astonish'd me:
2824   Her vertues graced with externall gifts,
2825   Do breed Loues setled passions in my heart,
2826   And like as rigour of tempestuous gustes
2827   Prouokes the mightiest Hulke against the tide,
2828   So am I driuen by breath of her Renowne,
2829   Either to suffer Shipwracke, or arriue
2830   Where I may haue fruition of her Loue.
2831   <S {Suf}.> Tush my good Lord, this superficiall tale,
2832   Is but a preface of her worthy praise:
2833   The cheefe perfections of that louely Dame,
2834   (Had I sufficient skill to vtter them)
2835   Would make a volume of inticing lines,
2836   Able to rauish any dull conceit.
2837   And which is more, she is not so Diuine,
2838   So full repleate with choice of all delights,
2839   But with as humble lowlinesse of minde,
2840   She is content to be at your command:
2841   Command I meane, of Vertuous chaste intents,
2842   To Loue, and Honor {Henry} as her Lord.
2843   <S {King}.> And otherwise, will {Henry} ne're presume:
2844   Therefore my Lord Protector, giue consent,
2845   That {Marg'ret} may be Englands Royall Queene.
2846   <S {Glo}.> So should I giue consent to flatter sinne,
2847   You know (my Lord) your Highnesse is betroath'd
2848   Vnto another Lady of esteeme,
2849   How shall we then dispense with that contract,
2850   And not deface your Honor with reproach?
2851   <S {Suf}.> As doth a Ruler with vnlawfull Oathes,
2852   Or one that at a Triumph, hauing vow'd
2853   To try his strength, forsaketh yet the Listes
2854   By reason of his Aduersaries oddes.
2855   A poore Earles daughter is vnequall oddes,
2856   And therefore may be broke without offence.
2857   <S {Gloucester}.> Why what (I pray) is {Margaret} more
2858   then that?
2859   Her Father is no better than an Earle,
2860   Although in glorious Titles he excell.
2861   <S {Suf}.> Yes my Lord, her Father is a King,
2862   The King of Naples, and Ierusalem,
2863   And of such great Authoritie in France,
2864   As his alliance will confirme our peace,
2865   And keepe the Frenchmen in Allegeance.
2866   <S {Glo}.> And so the Earle of Arminacke may doe,
2867   Because he is neere Kinsman vnto {Charles}.
2868  *<S {Exet}.> Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
2869   Where {Reignier} sooner will receyue, than giue.
2870  *<S {Suf}.> A Dowre my Lords? Disgrace not so your King,
2871   That he should be so abiect, base, and poore,
2872   To choose for wealth, and not for perfect Loue.
2873   {Henry} is able to enrich his Queene,
2874   And not to seeke a Queene to make him rich,
2875   So worthlesse Pezants bargaine for their Wiues,
2876   As Market men for Oxen, Sheepe, or Horse.
2877   Marriage is a matter of more worth,
2878   Then to be dealt in by Atturney- ship:
2879   Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
      <P m2>
2880   Must be companion of his Nuptiall bed.
2881   And therefore Lords, since he affects her most,
2882   Most of all these reasons bindeth vs,
2883   In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
2884   For what is wedlocke forced? but a #Hell,
2885   An Age of discord and continuall strife,
2886   Whereas the contrarie bringeth blisse,
2887   And is a patterne of Celestiall peace.
2888   Whom should we match with {Henry} being a King,
2889   But {Margaret}, that is daughter to a King:
2890   Her peerelesse feature, ioyned with her birth,
2891   Approues her fit for none, but for a King.
2892   Her valiant courage, and vndaunted spirit,
2893   (More then in women commonly is seene)
2894   Will answer our hope in issue of a King.
2895   For {Henry}, sonne vnto a Conqueror,
2896   Is likely to beget more Conquerors,
2897   If with a Lady of so high resolue,
2898   (As is faire {Margaret}) he be link'd in loue.
2899   Then yeeld my Lords, and heere conclude with mee,
2900   That {Margaret} shall be Queene, and none but shee.
2901   <S {King}.> Whether it be through force of your report,
2902   My Noble Lord of Suffolke: Or for that
2903   My tender youth was neuer yet attaint
2904   With any passion of inflaming Loue,
2905   I cannot tell: but this I am assur'd,
2906   I feele such sharpe dissention in my breast,
2907   Such fierce alarums both of Hope and Feare,
2908   As I am sicke with working of my thoughts.
2909   Take therefore shipping, poste my Lord to France,
2910   Agree to any couenants, and procure
2911   That Lady {Margaret} do vouchsafe to come
2912   To crosse the Seas to England, and be crown'd
2913   King {Henries} faithfull and annointed Queene.
2914   For your expences and sufficient charge,
2915   Among the people gather vp a tenth.
2916   Be gone I say, for till you  do returne,
2917   I rest perplexed with a thousand Cares.
2918   And you (good Vnckle) banish all offence:
2919   If you do censure me, by what you were,
2920   Not what you are, I know it will excuse
2921   This sodaine execution of my #will.
2922   And so conduct me, where from company,
2923   I may reuolue and ruminate my greefe.  <D {Exit}.>
2924   <S {Glo}.> I greefe I feare me, both at first and last.
2925   <D {Exit Glocester}.>
2926   <S {Suf}.> Thus Suffolke hath preuail'd, and thus he goes
2927   As did the youthfull {Paris} once to Greece,
2928   With hope to finde the like euent in loue,
2929   But prosper better than the Troian did:
2930   {Margaret} shall now be Queene, and rule the King:
2931   But I will rule both her, the King, and Realme.  <D {Exit}>
2932   <Z FINIS.
2933   The first Part of Henry the Sixt.>
