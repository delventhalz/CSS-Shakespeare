2      {O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend}
3      {The brightest Heauen of Inuention:}
4      {A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act},
5      {And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene}.
6      {Then should the Warlike} Harry, {like himselfe},
7      {Assume the Port of} Mars, {and at his heeles}
8      ({Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire}
9      {Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:}
10     {The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd},
11     {On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth}
12     {So great an Obiect. Can this Cock- Pit hold}
13     {The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme}
14     {Within this Woodden #O, the very Caskes}
15     {That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?}
16     {O pardon: since a crooked Figure may}
17     {Attest in little place a Million},
18     {And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt},
19     {On your imaginarie Forces worke}.
20     {Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls}
21     {Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies},
22     {Whose high, vp- reared, and abutting Fronts},
23     {The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder}.
24     {Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:}
25     {Into a thousand parts diuide one Man},
26     {And make imaginarie Puissance}.
27     {Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them}
28     {Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:}
29     {For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings},
30     {Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;}
31     {Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres}
32     {Into an Howre- glasse: for the which supplie},
33     {Admit me} Chorus {to this Historie;}
34     {Who Prologue- like, your humble patience pray},
35     {Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play}.  <D {Exit}.>
36     <Z {Actus Primus. Scoena Prima}.>
37     <D {Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely}.>
38     <S {Bish.Cant}.>
39     My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,
40    *Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign
41     Was like, and had indeed against vs past,
42     But that the scambling and vnquiet time
43     Did push it out of farther question.
44     <S {Bish.Ely}.> But how my Lord shall we resist it now?
45     <S {Bish.Cant}.> It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,
46     We loose the better halfe of our Possession:
47     For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout
48     By Testament haue giuen to the Church,
49     Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,
50     As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,
51     Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,
52     Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:
53     And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age
54     Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,
55     A hundred Almes- houses, right well supply'd:
56     And to the Coffers of the King beside,
57     A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill.
58     <S {Bish.Ely}.> This would drinke deepe.
59     <S {Bish.Cant}.> 'Twould drinke the Cup and all.
60     <S {Bish.Ely}.> But what preuention?
61    *<S {Bish.Cant}.> The King is full of grace, and faire re-gard.
62    _
63     <S {Bish.Ely}.> And a true louer of the holy Church.
64     <S {Bish.Cant}.> The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
65     The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,
66     But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,
67     Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,
68     Consideration like an Angell came,
69     And whipt th' offending {Adam} out of him;
70     Leauing his body as a Paradise,
71     T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.
72     Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:
73     Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,
74     With such a heady currance scowring faults:
75     Nor neuer {Hidra}- headed Wilfulnesse
76     So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;
77     As in this King.
78     <S {Bish.Ely}.> We are blessed in the Change.
79     <S {Bish.Cant}.> Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;
80     And all- admiring, with an inward wish
81     You would desire the King were made a Prelate:
82     Heare him debate of Common- wealth Affaires;
83     You would say, it hath been all in all his study:
84     List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare
85     A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.
      <P h1v>
86     Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,
87     The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,
88     Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,
89     The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,
90     And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,
91     To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:
92     So that the #Art and Practique part of Life,
93     Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.
94     Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,
95     Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,
96     His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,
97     His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;
98     And neuer noted in him any studie,
99     Any retyrement, any sequestration,
100    From open Haunts and Popularitie.
101   *<S {B.Ely}.> The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,
102    And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,
103    Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:
104    And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation
105    Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)
106    Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,
107    Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie.
108    <S {B.Cant}.> It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:
109    And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,
110    How things are perfected.
111    <S {B.Ely}.> But my good Lord:
112    How now for mittigation of this Bill,
113    Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie
114    Incline to it, or no?
115    <S {B.Cant}.> He seemes indifferent:
116    Or rather swaying more vpon our part,
117    Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:
118    For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,
119    Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,
120    And in regard of Causes now in hand,
121    Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,
122    As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,
123    Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
124    Did to his Predecessors part withall.
125    <S {B.Ely}.> How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?
126    <S {B.Cant}.> With good acceptance of his Maiestie:
127    Saue that there was not time enough to heare,
128    As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,
129    The seueralls and vnhidden passages
130    Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,
131    And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,
132    Deriu'd from {Edward}, his great Grandfather.
133    <S {B.Ely}.> What was th' impediment that broke this off?
134    <S {B.Cant}.> The French Embassador vpon that instant
135    Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,
136    To giue him hearing: Is it foure #a Clock?
137    <S {B.Ely}.> It is.
138    <S {B.Cant}.> Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:
139    Which I could with a ready guesse declare,
140    Before the Frenchman speake a word of it.
141    <S {B.Ely}.> Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.
142    <D {Exeunt}.>
143    <D {Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence},
144    {Warwick, Westmerland, and Exeter}.>
145    <S {King}.> Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
146    <S {Exeter}.> Not here in presence.
147    <S {King}.> Send for him, good Vnckle.
148    <S {Westm}.> Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?
149    <S {King}.> Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,
150    Before we heare him, of some things of weight,
151    That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.
152    <D {Enter two Bishops}.>
153   *<S {B.Cant}.> God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,
154    And make you long become it.
155    <S {King}.> Sure we thanke you.
156    My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,
157    And iustly and religiously vnfold,
158    Why the Law {Salike}, that they haue in France,
159    Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:
160    And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,
161    That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
162    Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,
163    With opening Titles miscreate, whose right
164    Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:
165    For God doth know, how many now in health,
166    Shall drop their blood, in approbation
167    Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.
168    Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,
169    How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;
170    We charge you in the Name of God take heed:
171    For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,
172    Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops
173    Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,
174    'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,
175    That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.
176    Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:
177    For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,
178    That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,
179    As pure as sinne with Baptisme.
180   *<S {B.Can}.> Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers,
181    That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,
182    To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre
183    To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,
184    But this which they produce from {Pharamond},
185    {In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant},
186    No Woman shall succeed in {Salike} Land:
187    Which {Salike} Land, the French vniustly gloze
188    To be the Realme of France, and {Pharamond}
189    The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.
190    Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,
191    That the Land {Salike} is in Germanie,
192    Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:
193    Where {Charles} the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,
194    There left behind and settled certaine French:
195    Who holding in disdaine the German Women,
196    For some dishonest manners of their life,
197    Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female
198    Should be Inheritrix in {Salike} Land:
199    Which {Salike} (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,
200    Is at this day in Germanie, call'd {Meisen}.
201    Then doth it well appeare, the {Salike} Law
202    Was not deuised for the Realme of France:
203    Nor did the French possesse the {Salike} Land,
204    Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
205    After defunction of King {Pharamond},
206    Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,
207    Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,
208    Foure hundred twentie six: and {Charles} the Great
209    Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
210    Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere
211    Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,
212    King {Pepin}, which deposed {Childerike},
213    Did as Heire Generall, being descended
214    Of {Blithild}, which was Daughter to King {Clothair},
215    Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.
216    {Hugh Capet} also, who vsurpt the Crowne
      <P h2>
217    Of {Charles} the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male
218    Of the true Line and Stock of {Charles} the Great:
219    To find his Title with some shewes of truth,
220    Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
221    Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady {Lingare},
222    Daughter to {Charlemaine}, who was the Sonne
223    To {Lewes} the Emperour, and {Lewes} the Sonne
224    Of {Charles} the Great: also King {Lewes} the Tenth,
225    Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper {Capet},
226    Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
227    Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,
228    That faire Queene {Isabel}, his Grandmother,
229    Was Lineall of the Lady {Ermengare},
230    Daughter to {Charles} the foresaid Duke of Loraine:
231    By the which Marriage, the Lyne of {Charles} the Great
232    Was re- vnited to the Crowne of France.
233    So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,
234    King {Pepins} Title, and {Hugh Capets} Clayme,
235    King {Lewes} his satisfaction, all appeare
236    To hold in Right and Title of the Female:
237    So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.
238    Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,
239    To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,
240    And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,
241    Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,
242    Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors.
243   *<S {King}.> May I with right and conscience make this claim?
244    <S {Bish.Cant}.> The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:
245    For in the Booke of {Numbers} is it writ,
246    When the man dyes, let the Inheritance
247    Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,
248    Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,
249    Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:
250    Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,
251    From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,
252    And your Great Vnckles, {Edward} the Black Prince,
253    Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,
254    Making defeat on the full Power of France:
255    Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
256    Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe
257    Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.
258    O Noble English, that could entertaine
259    With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,
260    And let another halfe stand laughing by,
261    All out of worke, and cold for action.
262    <S {Bish}.> Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
263    And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;
264    You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:
265    The Blood and Courage that renowned them,
266    Runs in your Veines: and my thrice- puissant Liege
267    Is in the very May- Morne of his Youth,
268    Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises.
269   *<S {Exe}.> Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
270    Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,
271    As did the former Lyons of your Blood.
272   *<S {West}.> They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and |(might;
273    So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England
274    Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,
275    Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,
276    And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France.
277    <S {Bish.Can}.> O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
278    With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:
279    In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie
280    Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,
281    As neuer did the Clergie at one time
282    Bring in to any of your Ancestors.
283    <S {King}.> We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,
284    But lay downe our proportions, to defend
285    Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,
286    With all aduantages.
287   *<S {Bish.Can}.> They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,
288    Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
289    Our in- land from the pilfering Borderers.
290   *<S {King}.> We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,
291    But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,
292    Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:
293    For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather
294    Neuer went with his forces into France,
295    But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
296    Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,
297    With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,
298    Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,
299    Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:
300    That England being emptie of defence,
301    Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood.
302   *<S {B.Can}.> She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:
303    For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,
304    When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,
305    And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,
306    Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,
307    But taken and impounded as a Stray,
308    The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,
309    To fill King {Edwards} fame with prisoner Kings,
310    And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,
311    As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
312    With sunken Wrack, and sum- lesse Treasuries.
313    <S {Bish.Ely}.> But there's a saying very old and true,
314    {If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin}.
315    For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,
316    To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)
317    Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,
318    Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,
319    To tame and hauocke more then she can eate.
320    <S {Exet}.> It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,
321    Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
322    Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,
323    And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.
324    While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,
325    Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:
326    For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,
327    Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,
328    Congreeing in a full and natural close,
329    Like Musicke.
330    <S {Cant}.> Therefore doth heauen diuide
331    The state of man in diuers functions,
332    Setting endeuour in continual motion:
333    To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,
334    Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,
335    Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
336    The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.
337    They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,
338    Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
339    Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:
340    Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,
341    Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:
342    Which pillage, they with merry march bring home
343    To the Tent- royal of their Emperor:
344    Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
345    The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,
346    The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;
347    The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in
348    Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:
      <P h2v>
349    The sad- ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,
350    Deliuering ore to Executors pale
351    The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,
352    That many things hauing full reference
353    To one consent, may worke contrariously,
354    As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
355    Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,
356    As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;
357    As many Lynes close in the Dials center:
358    So may a thousand actions once #a foote,
359    And in one purpose, and be all well borne
360    Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,
361    Diuide your happy England into foure,
362    Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
363    And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.
364    If we with thrice such powers left at home,
365    Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
366    Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
367    The name of hardinesse and policie.
368    <S {King}.> Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.
369    Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
370    And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
371    France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
372    Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,
373    (Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
374    Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)
375    Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
376    Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
377    Either our History shall with full mouth
378    Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
379    Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
380    Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.
381    <D {Enter Ambassadors of France}.>
382    Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
383    Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,
384    Your greeting is from him, not from the King.
385    <S {Amb}.> May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
386    Freely to render what we haue in charge:
387    Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
388    The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie.
389    <S {King}.> We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,
390    Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
391    As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,
392    Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,
393    Tell vs the {Dolphins} minde.
394    <S {Amb}.> Thus than in few:
395    Your Highnesse lately sending into France,
396    Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right
397    Of your great Predecessor, King {Edward} the third.
398    In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master
399    Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,
400    And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,
401    That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:
402    You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.
403    He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
404    This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,
405    Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
406    Heare no more of you. This the {Dolphin} speakes.
407    <S {King}.> What Treasure Vncle?
408    <S {Exe}.> Tennis balles, my Liege.
409    <S {Kin}.> We are glad the {Dolphin} is so pleasant with vs,
410    His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:
411    When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,
412    We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,
413    Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.
414    Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,
415    That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd
416    With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,
417    How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,
418    Not measuring what vse we made of them.
419    We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,
420    And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe
421    To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,
422    That men are merriest, when they are from home.
423    But tell the {Dolphin}, I will keepe my State,
424    Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,
425    When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.
426    For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,
427    And plodded like a man for working dayes:
428    But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
429    That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
430    Yea strike the {Dolphin} blinde to looke on vs,
431    And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
432    Hath turn'd his balles to Gun- stones, and his soule
433    Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
434   *That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows
435   *Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;
436   *Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:
437    And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
438    That shal haue cause to curse the {Dolphins} scorne.
439    But this lyes all within the #wil of God,
440    To whom I do appeale, and in whose name
441    Tel you the {Dolphin}, I am comming on,
442    To venge me as I may, and to put forth
443    My rightfull hand in a wel- hallow'd cause.
444    So get you hence in peace: And tell the {Dolphin},
445    His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,
446    When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.
447    Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
448    <D {Exeunt Ambassadors}.>
449    <S {Exe}.> This was a merry Message.
450    <S {King}.> We hope to make the Sender blush at it:
451    Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,
452    That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:
453    For we haue now no thought in vs but France,
454    Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.
455    Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
456    Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,
457    That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
458    More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,
459    Wee'le chide this {Dolphin} at his fathers doore.
460    Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
461   *That this faire Action may on foot be brought.  <D {Exeunt}.>
462    <D {Flourish. Enter Chorus}.>
463    Now all the Youth of England are on fire,
464    And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes:
465    Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought
466    Reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
467    They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse;
468    Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings,
469    With winged heeles, as English {Mercuries}.
470    For now sits Expectation in the Ayre,
471    And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point,
472    With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets,
473    Promis'd to {Harry}, and his followers.
474    The French aduis'd by good intelligence
475    Of this most dreadfull preparation,
476    Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy
477    Seeke to diuert the English purposes.
478    O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse,
479    Like little Body with a mightie Heart:
      <P h3><C B>
480    What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
481    Were all thy children kinde and naturall:
482    But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
483    A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles
484    With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men:
485    One, {Richard} Earle of Cambridge, and the second
486    {Henry} Lord {Scroope} of {Masham}, and the third
487    Sir {Thomas Grey} Knight of Northumberland,
488    Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed)
489    Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France,
490    And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye.
491    If #Hell and Treason hold their promises,
492    Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
493    Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest
494    Th' abuse of distance; force a play:
495    The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed,
496    The King is set from London, and the Scene
497    Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton,
498    There is the Play- house now, there must you sit,
499    And thence to France shall we conuey you safe,
500    And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas
501    To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may,
502    Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play.
503    But till the King come forth, and not till then,
504    Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene.  <D {Exit}>
505    <D {Enter Corporall Nym, and Lieutenant Bardolfe}.>
506    <S {Bar}.> Well met Corporall {Nym}.
507    <S {Nym}.> Good morrow Lieutenant {Bardolfe}.
508    <S {Bar}.> What, are Ancient {Pistoll} and you friends yet?
509   *<S {Nym}.> For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
510   *time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
511   *it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
512   *mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
513   *toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
514    sword will: and there's an end.
515   *<S {Bar}.> I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
516   *and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
517    be so good Corporall {Nym}.
518   *<S {Nym}.> Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the cer-taine
519   *of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
520    as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it.
521   *<S {Bar}.> It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
522   *{Nell Quickly}, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
523    were troth- plight to her.
524   *<S {Nym}.> I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
525   *may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
526   *at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
527   *be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
528   *will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
529    tell.
530    <D {Enter Pistoll, & Quickly}.>
531   *<S {Bar}.> Heere comes Ancient {Pistoll} and his wife: good
532   *Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste {Pi-stoll}?
533   _
534   *<S {Pist}.> Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste, now by this
535   *hand I sweare I scorne the terme: nor shall my {Nel} keep
536    Lodgers.
537   *<S {Host}.> No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
538   *and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
539   *honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
540   *thought we keepe a Bawdy- house straight. O welliday
541   *Lady, if he be not hewne now, we shall see wilful adulte-ry
542    and murther committed.
543   *<S {Bar}.> Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing
544    heere. <S {Nym}.> Pish.
545   *<S {Pist}.> Pish for thee, Island dogge: thou prickeard cur
546    of Island.
547   *<S {Host}.> Good Corporall {Nym} shew thy valor, and put
548    vp your sword.
549   *<S {Nym}.> Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus.
550   *<S {Pist}.> Solus, egregious dog? O Viper vile; The solus
551   *in thy most meruailous face, the solus in thy teeth, and
552   *in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
553   *perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
554   *do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and {Pi-stols}
555    cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow.
556   *<S {Nym}.> I am not {Barbason}, you cannot coniure mee: I
557   *haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
558   *grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
559   *Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
560   *off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
561    I may, and that's the humor of it.
562    <S {Pist}.> O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,
563    The Graue doth gape, and doting death is neere,
564    Therefore exhale.
565   *<S {Bar}.> Heare me, heare me what I say: Hee that strikes
566   *the first stroake, Ile run him vp to the hilts, as I am a sol-dier.
567   _
568    <S {Pist}.> An oath of mickle #might, and fury shall abate.
569   *Giue me thy fist, thy fore- foote to me giue: Thy spirites
570    are most tall.
571   *<S {Nym}.> I will cut thy throate one time or other in faire
572    termes, that is the humor of it.
573   *<S {Pistoll}.> {Couple a gorge}, that is the word. I defie thee a-gaine.
574   *O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?
575   *No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of in-famy,
576   *fetch forth the Lazar Kite of {Cressids} kinde, {Doll}
577   *{Teare- sheete}, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I
578   *will hold the {Quondam Quickely} for the onely #shee: and
579    {Pauca}, there's enough to go to.
580    <D {Enter the Boy}.>
581   *<S {Boy}.> Mine Hoast {Pistoll}, you must come to my May-ster,
582   *and your Hostesse: He is very sicke, & would to bed.
583   *Good {Bardolfe}, put thy face betweene his sheets, and do
584    the Office of a Warming- pan: Faith, he's very #ill.
585    <S {Bard}.> Away you Rogue.
586   *<S {Host}.> By my troth he'l yeeld the Crow a pudding one
587   *of these dayes: the King has kild his heart. Good Hus-band
588    come home presently.  <D {Exit}>
589   *<S {Bar}.> Come, shall I make you two friends. Wee must
590   *to France together: why the diuel should we keep kniues
591    to cut one anothers throats?
592   *<S {Pist}.> Let floods ore- swell, and fiends for food howle
593    on.
594   *<S {Nym}.> You'l pay me the eight shillings I won of you
595    at Betting?
596    <S {Pist}.> Base is the Slaue that payes.
597    <S {Nym}.> That now I wil haue: that's the humor of it.
598   *<S {Pist}.> As manhood shal compound: push home. <D {Draw}>
599   *<S {Bard}.> By this sword, hee that makes the first thrust,
600    Ile kill him: By this sword, I wil.
601   *<S {Pi}.> Sword is an Oath, & Oaths must haue their course
602   *<S {Bar}.> Coporall {Nym}, & thou wilt be friends be frends,
603   *#and thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to: pre-thee
604    put vp.
605   *<S {Pist}.> A Noble shalt thou haue, and present pay, and
606   *Liquor likewise will I giue to thee, and friendshippe
607   *shall combyne, and brotherhood. Ile liue by {Nymme}, &
608   *{Nymme} shall liue by me, is not this iust? For I shal Sut-ler
609   *be vnto the Campe, and profits will accrue. Giue mee
610    thy hand.
      <P h3v>
611    <S {Nym}.> I shall haue my Noble?
612    <S {Pist}.> In cash, most iustly payd.
613    <S {Nym}.> Well, then that the humor of't.
614    <D {Enter Hostesse}.>
615   *<S {Host}.> As euer you come of women, come in quickly
616   *to sir {Iohn}: #A poore heart, hee is so shak'd of a burning
617   *quotidian Tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
618    Sweet men, come to him.
619   *<S {Nym}.> The King hath run bad humors on the Knight,
620    that's the euen of it.
621   *<S {Pist}.> {Nym}, thou hast spoke the right, his heart is fra-cted
622    and corroborate.
623   *<S {Nym}.> The King is a good King, but it must bee as it
624    may: he passes some humors, and carreeres.
625   *<S {Pist}.> Let vs condole the Knight, for (Lambekins) we
626    will liue.
627    <D {Enter Exeter, Bedford, & Westmerland}.>
628   *<S {Bed}.> Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
629    <S {Exe}.> They shall be apprehended #by and by.
630   *<S {West}.> How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,
631    As if allegeance in their bosomes sate
632    Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty.
633    <S {Bed}.> The King hath note of all that they intend,
634    By interception, which they dreame not of.
635    <S {Exe}.> Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
636    Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious fauours;
637    That he should for a forraigne purse, so sell
638    His Soueraignes life to death and treachery.
639    <D {Sound Trumpets}.>
640    <D {Enter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray}.>
641    <S {King}.> Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.
642    My Lord of {Cambridge}, and my kinde Lord of {Masham},
643    And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:
644    Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs
645    Will cut their passage through the force of France?
646    Doing the execution, and the acte,
647    For which we haue in head assembled them.
648    <S {Scro}.> No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best.
649    <S {King}.> I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded
650    We carry not a heart with vs from hence,
651    That growes   not in a faire consent with ours:
652    Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish
653    Successe and Conquest to attend on vs.
654    <S {Cam}.> Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd,
655    Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect
656    That sits in heart- greefe and vneasinesse
657    Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment.
658    <S {Kni}.> True: those that were your Fathers enemies,
659    Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you
660    With hearts create of duty, and of zeale.
661   *<S {King}.> We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,
662    And shall forget the office of our hand
663    Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,
664    According to the weight and worthinesse.
665    <S {Scro}.> So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,
666    And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
667    To do your Grace incessant seruices.
668    <S {King}.> We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of {Exeter},
669    Inlarge the man committed yesterday,
670    That rayl'd against our person: We consider
671    It was excesse of Wine that set him on,
672    And on his more aduice, We pardon him.
673    <S {Scro}.> That's mercy, but too much security:
674    Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example
675    Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind.
676    <S {King}.> O let vs yet be mercifull.
677    <S {Cam}.> So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too.
678   *<S {Grey}.> Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,
679    After the taste of much correction.
680    <S {King}.> Alas, your too much loue and care of me,
681    Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:
682    If little faults proceeding on distemper,
683    Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
684   *When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
685    Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,
686   *Though {Cambridge, Scroope}, and {Gray}, in their deere care
687    And tender preseruation of our person
688   *Wold haue him punish'd. And now to our French causes,
689    Who are the late Commissioners?
690    <S {Cam}.> I one my Lord,
691    Your Highnesse bad me aske for it to day.
692    <S {Scro}.> So did you me my Liege.
693    <S {Gray}.> And I my Royall Soueraigne.
694   *<S {King}.> Then {Richard} Earle of {Cambridge}, there is yours:
695    There yours Lord {Scroope} of {Masham}, and Sir Knight:
696    {#Gray} of {Northumberland}, this same is yours:
697    Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.
698    My Lord of {Westmerland}, and Vnkle {Exeter},
699   *We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?
700    What see you in those papers, that you loose
701    So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:
702    Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,
703    That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood
704    Out of apparance.
705    <S {Cam}.> I do confesse my fault,
706    And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy.
707    <S {Gray}. {Scro}.> To which we all appeale.
708    <S {King}.> The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,
709    By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:
710    You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,
711    For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,
712    As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:
713    See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,
714    These English monsters: My Lord of {Cambridge} heere,
715    You know how apt our loue was, to accord
716    To furnish with all appertinents
717    Belonging to his Honour; and this man,
718    Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd
719    And sworne vnto the practises of France
720    To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,
721    This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
722    Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,
723    What shall I say to thee Lord {Scroope}, thou cruell,
724    Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?
725    Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,
726    That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,
727    That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,
728    Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?
729    May it be possible, that forraigne hyer
730    Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
731    That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
732    That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
733    As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.
734    Treason, and murther, euer kept together,
735    As two  yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,
736    Working so grossely in an naturall cause,
737    That admiration did not hoope at them.
738    But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in
739    Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:
740    And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
741    That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,
742    Hath got the voyce in #hell for excellence:
      <P h4>
743    And other diuels that suggest by treasons,
744    Do botch and bungle vp damnation,
745    With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht
746    From glist'ring semblances of piety:
747    But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,
748    Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
749    Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.
750    If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,
751    Should with his Lyon- gate walke the whole world,
752    He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,
753    And tell the Legions, I can neuer win
754    A soule so easie as that Englishmans.
755    Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected
756    The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,
757    Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?
758    Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?
759    Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?
760    Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
761    Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,
762    Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,
763    Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
764    Not working with the eye, without the eare,
765    And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,
766    Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:
767    And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,
768    To make thee full fraught man, and best indued
769    With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.
770    For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like
771    Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,
772    Arrest them to the answer of the Law,
773    And God acquit them of their practises.
774   *<S {Exe}.> I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of
775    {Richard} Earle of {Cambridge}.
776   *I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of {Thomas}
777    Lord {Scroope} of {Marsham}.
778   *I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of {Thomas}
779    {Grey}, Knight of {Northumberland}.
780    <S {Scro}.> Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,
781    And I repent my fault more then my death,
782    Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,
783    Although my body pay the price of it.
784    <S {Cam}.> For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,
785    Although I did admit it as a motiue,
786    The sooner to effect what I intended:
787    But God be thanked for preuention,
788    Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,
789    Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee.
790    <S {Gray}.> Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
791    At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,
792    Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,
793    Preuented from a damned enterprize;
794    My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne.
795   *<S {King}.> God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence
796    You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,
797    Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,
798    Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:
799    Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,
800    His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,
801    His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,
802    And his whole Kingdome into desolation:
803    Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,
804    But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,
805    Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes
806    We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,
807    (Poore miserable wretches) to your death:
808    The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue
      <C A>
809    You patience to indure, and true Repentance
810    Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence. <D {Exit}.>
811    Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof
812    Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.
813    We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,
814    Since God so graciously hath brought to light
815    This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,
816    To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,
817    But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.
818    Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer
819    Our Puissance into the hand of God,
820    Putting it straight in expedition.
821    Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,
822    No King of England, if not King of France. <D {Flourish}.>
823    <D {Enter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse}.>
824   *<S {Hostesse}.> 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring
825    thee to Staines.
826   *<S {Pistoll}.> No: for my manly heart doth erne. {Bardolph},
827   *be blythe: {Nim}, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle
828   *thy Courage vp: for {Falstaffe} hee is dead, and wee must
829    erne therefore.
830   *<S {Bard}.> Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is,
831    eyther in Heauen, or in #Hell.
832   *<S {Hostesse}.> Nay sure, hee's not in #Hell: hee's in {Arthurs}
833   *Bosome, if euer man went to {Arthurs} Bosome: #a made a
834   *finer end, and went away #and it had beene any Christome
835   *Childe: #a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n
836   *at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with
837   *the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fin-gers
838   *end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was
839   *as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now
840   *Sir {Iohn} (quoth I?) what man? be #a good cheare: so #a
841   *cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,
842   *to comfort him, bid him #a should not thinke of God; I
843   *hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any
844   *such thoughts yet: so #a bad me lay more Clothes on his
845   *feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they
846   *were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so
847    vp- peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone.
848    <S {Nim}.> They say he cryed out of Sack.
849    <S {Hostesse}.> #I, that #a did.
850    <S {Bard}.> And of Women.
851    <S {Hostesse}.> Nay, that #a did not.
852   *<S {Boy}.> Yes that #a did, and said they were Deules incar-nate.
853   _
854   *<S {Woman}.> #A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Co-lour
855    he neuer lik'd.
856   *<S {Boy}.> #A said once, the Deule would haue him about
857    Women.
858   *<S {Hostesse}.> #A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women:
859   *but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of
860    Babylon.
861   *<S {Boy}.> Doe you not remember #a saw a Flea sticke vpon
862   *{Bardolphs} Nose, and #a said it was a blacke Soule burning
863    in #Hell.
864   *<S {Bard}.> Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire:
865    that's all the Riches I got in his seruice.
866   *<S {Nim}.> Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from
867    Southampton.
868   *<S {Pist}.> Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes:
869   *Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences
870   *rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes
871   *are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer- Cakes, and hold- fast
872   *is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore {Caueto} bee
873   *thy Counsailor. Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yoke-fellowes
874   *in Armes, let vs to France, like Horse-leeches
      <P h4v>
875   *my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to
876    sucke.
877    <S {Boy}.> And that's but vnwholesome food, they say.
878    <S {Pist}.> Touch her soft mouth, and march.
879    <S {Bard}.> Farwell Hostesse.
880   *<S {Nim}.> I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but
881    adieu.
882   *<S {Pist}.> Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee
883    command.
884    <S {Hostesse}.> Farwell: adieu. <D {Exeunt}>
885    <D {Flourish}.>
886    <D {Enter the French King, the Dolphin, the Dukes}
887    {of Berry and Britaine}.>
888   *<S {King}.> Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,
889    And more then carefully it vs concernes,
890    To answer Royally in our defences.
891    Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,
892    Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,
893    And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch
894    To lyne and new repayre  our Townes of Warre
895    With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:
896    For England his approaches makes as fierce,
897    As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe.
898    It fits vs then to be as prouident,
899    As feare may teach vs, out of late examples
900    Left by the fatall and neglected English,
901    Vpon our fields.
902    <S {Dolphin}.> My most redoubted Father,
903    It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe:
904    For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome,
905   *(Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)
906    But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,
907    Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
908    As were a Warre in expectation.
909    Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,
910    To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
911    And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,
912    No, with no more, then if we heard that England
913    Were busied with a Whitson Morris- dance:
914    For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,
915    Her Scepter so phantastically borne,
916    By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,
917    That feare attends her not.
918    <S {Const}.> O peace, Prince Dolphin,
919    You are too much mistaken in this King:
920    Question your Grace the late Embassadors,
921    With what great State he heard their Embassie,
922    How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,
923    How modest in exception; and withall,
924    How terrible in constant resolution:
925    And you shall find, his Vanities fore- spent,
926    Were but the out- side of the Roman {Brutus},
927    Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;
928    As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
929    That shall first spring, and be most delicate.
930    <S {Dolphin}.> Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
931    But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:
932    In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
933    The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,
934    So the proportions of defence are fill'd:
935    Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,
936    Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting
937    A little Cloth.
938    <S {King}.> Thinke we King {Harry} strong:
939    And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him.
940    The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs:
941    And he is bred out of that bloodie straine,
942    That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes:
943    Witnesse our too much memorable shame,
944    When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke,
945    And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand
946    Of that black Name, {Edward}, black Prince of Wales:
947    Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing
948    Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,
949    Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him
950    Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface
951    The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers
952    Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem
953    Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare
954    The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him.
955    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
956    <S {Mess}.> Embassadors from {Harry} King of England,
957    Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie.
958    <S {King}.> Weele giue them present audience.
959    Goe, and bring them.
960    You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends.
961   *<S {Dolphin}.> Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs
962   *Most spend their mouths, whe[n] what they seem to threaten
963    Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne
964    Take vp the English short, and let them know
965    Of what a Monarchie you are the Head:
966    Selfe- loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne,
967    As selfe- neglecting.
968    <D {Enter Exeter}.>
969    <S {King}.> From our Brother of England?
970    <S {Exe}.> From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie:
971    He wills you in the Name of God Almightie,
972    That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart
973    The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,
974    By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs
975    To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,
976    And all wide- stretched Honors, that pertaine
977    By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,
978    Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know
979    'Tis no sinister, nor no awk-ward Clayme,
980    Pickt from the worme- holes of long- vanisht dayes,
981    Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,
982    He sends you this most memorable Lyne,
983    In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;
984    Willing you ouer- looke this Pedigree:
985    And when you find him euenly deriu'd
986    From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,
987    {Edward} the third; he bids you then resigne
988    Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held
989    From him, the Natiue and true Challenger.
990    <S {King}.> Or else what followes?
991   *<S {Exe}.> Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne
992    Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
993    Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,
994    In Thunder and in Earth- quake, like a {Ioue}:
995    That if requiring faile, he will compell.
996    And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,
997    Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie
998    On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre
999    Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head
1000   Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,
1001   The dead- mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,
1002   For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,
1003   That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.
1004   This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:
1005   Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;
1006   To whom expressely I bring greeting #to.
      <P h5>
1007   <S {King}.> For vs, we will consider of this further:
1008   To morrow shall you beare our full intent
1009   Back to our Brother of England.
1010   <S {Dolph}.> For the Dolphin,
1011   I stand here for him: what to him from England?
1012   <S {Exe}.> Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,
1013   And any thing that may not mis- become
1014   The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.
1015   Thus sayes my King: #and if your Fathers Highnesse
1016   Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,
1017   Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;
1018   Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,
1019   That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France
1020   Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock
1021   In second Accent of his Ordinance.
1022   <S {Dolph}.> Say: if my Father render faire returne,
1023   It is against my #will: for I desire
1024   Nothing but Oddes with England.
1025   To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,
1026   I did present him with the Paris- Balls.
1027   <S {Exe}.> Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,
1028   Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:
1029   And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,
1030   As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,
1031   Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,
1032   And these he masters now: now he weighes Time
1033   Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade
1034   In your owne Losses, if he stay in France.
1035   <S {King}.> To morrow shall you know our mind at full.
1036   <D {Flourish}.>
1037   <S {Exe}.> Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King
1038   Come here himselfe to question our delay;
1039   For he is footed in this Land already.
1040  *<S {King}.> You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions.
1041   A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse,
1042   To answer matters of this consequence. <D {Exeunt}.>
1043   <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
1044   <D {Flourish. Enter Chorus}.>
1045   Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes,
1046   In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought.
1047   Suppose, that you haue seene
1048   The well- appointed King at Douer Peer,
1049   Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet,
1050   With silken Streamers, the young {Phebus} fayning;
1051   Play with your Fancies: and in them behold,
1052   Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship- boyes climbing;
1053   Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue
1054   To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles,
1055   Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind,
1056   Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea,
1057   Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke
1058   You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold
1059   A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing:
1060   For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall,
1061   Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow:
1062   Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie,
1063   And leaue your England as dead Mid- night, still,
1064   Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women,
1065   Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance:
1066   For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht
1067   With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow
1068   These cull'd and choyse- drawne Caualiers to France?
1069   Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege:
1070   Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages,
1071   With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew.
1072   Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back:
1073   Tells {Harry}, That the King doth offer him
1074   {Katherine} his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie,
1075   Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes.
1076   The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner
1077   With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches,
1078   <D {Alarum, and Chambers goe off}.>
1079   And downe goes all before them. Still be kind,
1080   And eech out our performance with your mind. <D {Exit}.>
1081   <D {Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester}.
1082   {Alarum: Scaling Ladders at Harflew}.>
1083   <S {King}.> Once more vnto the Breach,
1084   Deare friends, once more;
1085   Or close the Wall vp with our English dead:
1086   In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
1087   As modest stillnesse, and humilitie:
1088   But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares,
1089   Then imitate the action of the Tyger:
1090   Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood,
1091   Disguise faire Nature with hard- fauour'd Rage:
1092   Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect:
1093   Let it pry through the portage of the Head,
1094   Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it,
1095   As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke
1096   O're- hang and iutty his confounded Base,
1097   Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean.
1098   Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide,
1099   Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit
1100   To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English,
1101   Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre- proofe:
1102   Fathers, that like so many {Alexanders},
1103   Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought,
1104   And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument.
1105   Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest,
1106   That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you.
1107   Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood,
1108  *And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen,
1109   Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here
1110   The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare,
1111   That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not:
1112   For there is none of you so meane and base,
1113   That hath not Noble luster in your eyes.
1114   I see you stand like Grey- hounds in the slips,
1115   Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot:
1116   Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge,
1117   Cry, God for {Harry}, England, and S[aint]. {George}.
1118   <D {Alarum, and Chambers goe off}.>
1119   <D {Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy}.>
1120   <S {Bard}.> On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach.
1121  *<S {Nim}.> 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too
1122  *hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues:
1123  *the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine- Song
1124   of it.
1125  *<S {Pist}.> The plaine- Song is most iust: for humors doe a-bound:
1126  *Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and
1127  *dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne
1128   immortall fame.
1129  *<S {Boy}.> Would I were in a Ale- house in London, I
1130   would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie.
      <P h5v>
1131  *<S {Pist}.> And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my
1132  *purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I
1133   high.
1134  *<S {Boy}.> As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on
1135   bough.
1136   <D {Enter Fluellen}.>
1137  *<S {Flu}.> Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you
1138   Cullions.
1139  *<S {Pist}.> Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: a-bate
1140  *thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,
1141  *great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie
1142   sweet Chuck.
1143  *<S {Nim}.> These be good humors: your Honor wins bad
1144   humors.  <D {Exit}.>
1145  *<S {Boy}.> As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three
1146  *Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,
1147  *though they would serue me, could not be Man to me;
1148  *for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:
1149  *for {Bardolph}, hee is white- liuer'd, and red- fac'd; by the
1150  *meanes whereof, #a faces it out, but fights not: for {Pistoll},
1151  *hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
1152  *meanes whereof, #a breakes Words, and keepes whole
1153  *Weapons: for {Nim}, hee hath heard, that men of few
1154  *Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
1155  *his Prayers, lest #a should be thought a Coward: but his
1156  *few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
1157  *#a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
1158  *against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
1159  *thing, and call it Purchase. {Bardolph} stole a Lute- case,
1160  *bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
1161  *{#Nim} and {Bardolph} are sworne Brothers in filching: and
1162  *in Callice they stole a fire- shouell. I knew by that peece
1163  *of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
1164  *haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
1165  *or their Hand- kerchers: which makes much against my
1166  *Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
1167  *into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
1168  *I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
1169  *Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
1170   I must cast it vp. <D {Exit}.>
1171   <D {Enter Gower}.>
1172  *<S {Gower}.> Captaine {Fluellen}, you must come presently to
1173  *the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
1174   you.
1175  *<S {Flu}.> To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
1176  *good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
1177  *is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the con-cauities
1178  *of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuer-sarie,
1179  *you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
1180  *himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by {Cheshu},
1181  *I thinke #a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directi-ons.
1182  _
1183  *<S {Gower}.> The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
1184  *of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
1185   man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith.
1186   <S {Welch}.> It is Captaine {Makmorrice}, is it not?
1187   <S {Gower}.> I thinke it be.
1188  *<S {Welch}.> By {Cheshu} he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
1189  *verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions
1190  *in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the
1191   Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy- dog.
1192   <D {Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy}.>
1193  *<S {Gower}.> Here #a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine
1194   {Iamy}, with him.
1195  *<S {Welch}.> Captaine {Iamy} is a maruellous falorous Gen-tleman,
1196  *that is certain, and of great expedition and know-ledge
1197  *in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular know-ledge
1198  *of his directions: by {Cheshu} he will maintaine his
1199  *Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
1200   the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans.
1201   <S {Scot}.> I say gudday, Captaine {Fluellen}.
1202  *<S {Welch}.> Godden to your Worship, good Captaine
1203   {Iames}.
1204  *<S {Gower}.> How now Captaine {Mackmorrice}, haue you
1205   quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
1206  *<S {Irish}.> By Chrish Law tish #ill done: the Worke ish
1207  *giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
1208  *I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish #ill done:
1209  *it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
1210  *so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish #ill done, tish #ill
1211   done: by my Hand tish #ill done.
1212  *<S {Welch}.> Captaine {Mackmorrice}, I beseech you now,
1213  *will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
1214  *you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
1215  *the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
1216  *looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
1217  *my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
1218  *my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie dis-cipline,
1219   that is the Point.
1220  *<S {Scot}.> It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
1221  *and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
1222   that sall I mary.
1223  *<S {Irish}.> It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
1224  *the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
1225  *King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
1226  *is beseech'd: #and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
1227  *we talke, and #be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
1228  *so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
1229  *hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
1230   done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law.
1231  *<S {Scot}.> By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take them-selues
1232  *to slomber, ayle #de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'
1233  *grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valo-rously
1234  *as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
1235  *the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
1236   tween you tway.
1237  *<S {Welch}.> Captaine {Mackmorrice}, I thinke, looke you,
1238  *vnder your correction, there is not many of your Na-tion.
1239  _
1240  *<S {Irish}.> Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a
1241  *Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
1242   ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
1243  *<S {Welch}.> Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
1244  *then is meant, Captaine {Mackmorrice}, peraduenture I
1245  *shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
1246  *discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
1247  *a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
1248  *in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particula-rities.
1249  _
1250  *<S {Irish}.> I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:
1251   so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head.
1252  *<S {Gower}.> Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
1253   <S {Scot}.> #A, that's a foule fault.  <D {A Parley}.>
1254   <S {Gower}.> The Towne sounds a Parley.
1255  *<S {Welch}.> Captaine {Mackmorrice}, when there is more
1256  *better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
1257  *so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:
1258   and there is an end.  <D {Exit}.>
1259   <D {Enter the King and all his Traine before the Gates}.>
1260  *<S {King}.> How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne?
1261   This is the latest Parle we will admit:
      <P h6>
1262   Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues,
1263   Or like to men prowd of destruction,
1264   Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier,
1265   A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best;
1266   If I begin the batt'rie once againe,
1267   I will not leaue the halfe- atchieued Harflew,
1268   Till in her ashes she lye buryed.
1269   The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp,
1270   And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart,
1271   In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge
1272   With Conscience wide as #Hell, mowing like Grasse
1273   Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants.
1274   What is it then to me, if impious Warre,
1275   Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,
1276   Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats,
1277   Enlynckt to #wast and desolation?
1278   What is't to me, when you your selues are cause,
1279   If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
1280   Of hot and forcing Violation?
1281   What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse,
1282   When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?
1283   We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
1284   Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle,
1285   As send Precepts to the {Leuiathan}, to come ashore.
1286   Therefore, you men of Harflew,
1287   Take pitty of your Towne and of your People,
1288   Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command,
1289   Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
1290   O're- blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
1291   Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.
1292   If not: why in a moment looke to see
1293   The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand
1294   Desire the Locks of your shrill- shriking Daughters:
1295   Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,
1296   And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:
1297   Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,
1298   Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,
1299   Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,
1300   At {Herods} bloody- hunting slaughter- men.
1301   What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd?
1302   Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd.
1303   <D {Enter Gouernour}.>
1304   <S {Gouer}.> Our expectation hath this day an end:
1305   The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated,
1306   Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready,
1307   To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King,
1308   We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy:
1309   Enter our Gates, dispose of vs and ours,
1310   For we no longer are defensible.
1311   <S {King}.> Open your Gates: Come Vnckle {Exeter},
1312   Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine,
1313   And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French:
1314   Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle.
1315   The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing
1316   Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis.
1317   To night in Harflew will we be your Guest,
1318   To morrow for the March are we addrest.

1427   Barre {Harry} England, that sweepes through our Land
1428   With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew:
1429   Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow

1432   Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough,

1453  *<S {Flu}.> I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices com-mitted
1454   at the Bridge.
1455   <S {Gower}.> Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
1456  *<S {Flu}.> The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as {Aga-memnon},
1457  *and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
1458  *and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
1459  *and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
1460  *blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
1461  *most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aun-chient
1462  *Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
1463  *conscience hee is as valiant a man as {Marke Anthony}, and
1464  *hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
1465   him doe as gallant seruice.

1473  *<S {Flu}.> #I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at
1474   his hands.
1475  *<S {Pist}.> {Bardolph}, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
1476  *and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
1477  *Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
1478   stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone.
1479  *<S {Flu}.> By your patience, aunchient {Pistoll}: Fortune is
1480  *painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
1481  *to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
1482  *with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
1483  *it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
1484  *and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
1485  *Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
1486  *in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent descripti-on
1487   of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall.
1488  *<S {Pist}.> Fortune is {Bardolphs} foe, and frownes on him:
1489  *for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must #a be: a damned
1490  *death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
1491  *and let not Hempe his Wind- pipe suffocate: but {Exeter}
1492  *hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
1493  *Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
1494  *and let not {Bardolphs} vitall thred bee cut with edge of
1495  *Penny- Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
1496   his Life, and I will thee requite.
1497  *<S {Flu}.> Aunchient {Pistoll}, I doe partly vnderstand your
1498   meaning.
1499   <S {Pist}.> Why then reioyce therefore.
1500  *<S {Flu}.> Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
1501  *at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
1502  *the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execu-tion;
1503   for discipline ought to be vsed.
1504   <S {Pist}.> Dye, and be dam'd, and {Figo} for thy friendship.
1505   <S {Flu}.> It is well.
1506   <S {Pist}.> The Figge of Spaine.  <D {Exit}.>
1507   <S {Flu}.> Very good.
1508  *<S {Gower}.> Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I
1509   remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut- purse.
1510  *<S {Flu}.> Ile assure you, #a vtt'red as praue words at the
1511  *Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
1512  *well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
1513   when time is serue.
1514  *<S {Gower}.> Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
1515  *then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
1516  *into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
1517  *fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
1518  *they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
1519  *at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Con-uoy:
1520  *who came off brauely, who was shot, who dis-grac'd,
1521  *what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
1522  *conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
      <P i1>
1523  *vp with new- tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Ge-neralls
1524  *Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe a-mong
1525  *foming Bottles, and Ale- washt Wits, is wonder-full
1526  *to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
1527  *slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mi-stooke.
1528  _
1529  *<S {Flu}.> I tell you what, Captaine {Gower}: I doe perceiue
1530  *hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
1531  *the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
1532  *him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
1533   must speake with him from the Pridge.
1534   <D {Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his}
1535   {poore Souldiers}.>
1536   <S {Flu}.> God plesse your Maiestie.
1537  *<S {King}.> How now {Fluellen}, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
1538  *<S {Flu}.> #I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
1539  *ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
1540  *gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
1541  *passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
1542  *the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
1543  *Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
1544   the Duke is a praue man.
1545   <S {King}.> What men haue you lost, {Fluellen}?
1546  *<S {Flu}.> The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
1547  *great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
1548  *Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be exe-cuted
1549  *for robbing a Church, one {Bardolph}, if your Maie-stie
1550  *know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
1551  *and knobs, and flames #a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
1552  *nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
1553  *sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
1554   out.
1555  *<S {King}.> Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
1556  *and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
1557  *the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Vil-lages;
1558  *nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
1559  *vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
1560  *Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
1561   Gamester is the soonest winner.
1562   <D {Tucket. Enter Mountioy}.>
1563   <S {Mountioy}.> You know me by my habit.
1564  *<S {King}.> Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of
1565   thee?
1566   <S {Mountioy}.> My Masters mind.
1567   <S {King}.> Vnfold it.
1568  *<S {Mountioy}.> Thus sayes my King: Say thou to {Harry}
1569  *of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
1570  *Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
1571  *wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
1572  *thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
1573  *ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is im-periall:
1574  *England shall repent his folly, see his weake-nesse,
1575  *and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore con-sider
1576  *of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
1577  *haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
1578  *haue digested; which in weight to re- answer, his petti-nesse
1579  *would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
1580  *too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
1581  *Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
1582  *owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worth-lesse
1583  *satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
1584  *conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose con-demnation
1585  *is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
1586   so much my Office.
1587   <S {King}.> What is thy name? I know thy qualitie.
1588   <S {Mount}.> {Mountioy}.
1589  *<S {King}.> Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,
1590   And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,
1591   But could be willing to march on to Callice,
1592   Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,
1593   Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much
1594   Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,
1595   My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,
1596   My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,
1597   Almost no better then so many French;
1598   Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,
1599   I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
1600   Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,
1601   That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
1602   Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:
1603   Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
1604   My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
1605   My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
1606   Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
1607   Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
1608   Stand in our way. There's for thy labour {Mountioy}.
1609   Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.
1610   If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
1611   We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
1612   Discolour: and so {Mountioy}, fare you well.
1613   The summe of all our Answer is but this:
1614   We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
1615   Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
1616   So tell your Master.
1617  *<S {Mount}.> I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your High-nesse.
1618  _
1619   <S {Glouc}.> I hope they will not come vpon vs now.
1620   <S {King}.> We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:
1621   March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,
1622   Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,
1623   And on to morrow bid them march away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1624   <D {Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ramburs},
1625   {#Orleance, Dolphin, with others}.>
1626  *<S {Const}.> Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:
1627   would it were day.
1628  *<S {Orleance}.> You haue an excellent Armour: but let my
1629   Horse haue his due.
1630   <S {Const}.> It is the best Horse of Europe.
1631   <S {Orleance}.> Will it neuer be Morning?
1632  *<S {Dolph}.> My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Con-stable,
1633   you talke of Horse and Armour?
1634  *<S {Orleance}.> You are as well prouided of both, as any
1635   Prince in the World.
1636  *<S {Dolph}.> What a long Night is this? I will not change
1637  *my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
1638  *ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
1639  *hayres: {le Cheual volante}, the Pegasus, {ches les narines de}
1640  *{feu}. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
1641  *the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
1642  *horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
1643   {Hermes}.
1644   <S {Orleance}.> Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg.
1645  *<S {Dolph}.> And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
1646  *for {Perseus}: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Ele-ments
1647  *of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but on-ly
1648  *in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
1649  *is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
1650   Beasts.
      <P i1v>
1651  *<S {Const}.> Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and ex-cellent
1652   Horse.
1653  *<S {Dolph}.> It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like
1654  *the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
1655   Homage.
1656   <S {Orleance}.> No more Cousin.
1657  *<S {Dolph}.> Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
1658  *the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
1659  *varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
1660  *fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
1661  *and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
1662  *for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes So-ueraigne
1663  *to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
1664  *and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
1665  *and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,
1666   and began thus, {Wonder of Nature}.
1667  *<S {Orleance}.> I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mi-stresse.
1668  _
1669  *<S {Dolph}.> Then did they imitate that which I compos'd
1670   to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse.
1671   <S {Orleance}.> Your Mistresse beares well.
1672  *<S {Dolph}.> Me well, which is the prescript prayse and per-fection
1673   of a good and particular Mistresse.
1674  *<S {Const}.> Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse
1675   shrewdly shooke your back.
1676   <S {Dolph}.> So perhaps did yours.
1677   <S {Const}.> Mine was not bridled.
1678  *<S {Dolph}.> O then belike she was old and gentle, and you
1679  *rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in
1680   your strait Strossers.
1681  *<S {Const}.> You haue good iudgement in Horseman-ship.
1682  _
1683  *<S {Dolph}.> Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and
1684  *ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue
1685   my Horse to my Mistresse.
1686   <S {Const}.> I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade.
1687  *<S {Dolph}.> I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his
1688   owne hayre.
1689  *<S {Const}.> I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
1690   Sow to my Mistresse.
1691  *<S {Dolph}.> {Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est}
1692   {la leuye lauee au bourbier:} thou mak'st vse of any thing.
1693  *<S {Const}.> Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,
1694   or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose.
1695  *<S {Ramb}.> My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in
1696   your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?
1697   <S {Const}.> Starres my Lord.
1698   <S {Dolph}.> Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope.
1699   <S {Const}.> And yet my Sky shall not want.
1700  *<S {Dolph}.> That may be, for you beare a many superflu-ously,
1701   and 'twere more honor some were away.
1702  *<S {Const}.> Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who
1703  *would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismoun-ted.
1704  _
1705  *<S {Dolph}.> Would I were able to loade him with his de-sert.
1706  *Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,
1707   and my way shall be paued with English Faces.
1708  *<S {Const}.> I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out
1709  *of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
1710   faine be about the eares of the English.
1711  *<S {Ramb}.> Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie
1712   Prisoners?
1713  *<S {Const}.> You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you
1714   haue them.
1715   <S {Dolph}.> 'Tis Mid- night, Ile goe arme my selfe.  <D {Exit}.>
1716   <S {Orleance}.> The Dolphin longs for morning.
1717   <S {Ramb}.> He longs to eate the English.
1718   <S {Const}.> I thinke he will eate all he kills.
1719  *<S {Orleance}.> By the white Hand of my Lady, hee's a gal-lant
1720   Prince.
1721  *<S {Const}.> Sweare by her Foot, that she may tread out the
1722   Oath.
1723  *<S {Orleance}.> He is simply the most actiue Gentleman of
1724   France.
1725   <S {Const}.> Doing is actiuitie, and he will still be doing.
1726   <S {Orleance}.> He neuer did harme, that I heard of.
1727  *<S {Const}.> Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe
1728   that good name still.
1729   <S {Orleance}.> I know him to be valiant.
1730  *<S {Const}.> I was told that, by one that knowes him better
1731   then you.
1732   <S {Orleance}.> What's hee?
1733  *<S {Const}.> Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee
1734   car'd not who knew it.
1735  *<S {Orleance}.> Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in
1736   him.
1737  *<S {Const}.> By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw
1738  *it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
1739   appeares, it will bate.
1740   <S {Orleance}.> #Ill #will neuer sayd well.
1741  *<S {Const}.> I will cap that Prouerbe with, There is flatterie
1742   in friendship.
1743  *<S {Orleance}.> And I will take vp that with, Giue the Deuill
1744   his due.
1745  *<S {Const}.> Well plac't: there stands your friend for the
1746  *Deuill: haue at the very eye of that Prouerbe with, A
1747   Pox of the Deuill.
1748  *<S {Orleance}.> You are the better at Prouerbs, by how much
1749   a Fooles Bolt is soone shot.
1750   <S {Const}.> You haue shot ouer.
1751   <S {Orleance}.> 'Tis not the first time you were ouer- shot.
1752   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1753  *<S {Mess}.> My Lord high Constable, the English lye within
1754   fifteene hundred paces of your Tents.
1755   <S {Const}.> Who hath measur'd the ground?
1756   <S {Mess}.> The Lord {Grandpree}.
1757  *<S {Const}.> A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would
1758  *it were day? Alas poore {Harry} of England: hee longs
1759   not for the Dawning, as wee doe.
1760  *<S {Orleance}.> What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this
1761  *King of England, to mope with his fat- brain'd followers
1762   so farre out of his knowledge.
1763  *<S {Const}.> If the English had any apprehension, they
1764   would runne away.
1765  *<S {Orleance}.> That they lack: for if their heads had any in-tellectuall
1766  *Armour, they could neuer weare such heauie
1767   Head- pieces.
1768  *<S {Ramb}.> That Iland of England breedes very valiant
1769  *Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable cou-rage.
1770  _
1771  *<S {Orleance}.> Foolish Curres, that runne winking into
1772  *the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht
1773  *like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant
1774  *Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a
1775   Lyon.
1776  *<S {Const}.> Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with
1777  *the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,
1778  *leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue
1779  *them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they
1780   will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils.
      <P i2>
1781  *<S {Orleance}.> #I, but these English are shrowdly out of
1782   Beefe.
1783  *<S {Const}.> Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only
1784  *stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to
1785   arme: come, shall we about it?
1786  *<S {Orleance}.> It is now two #a Clock: but let me see, by ten
1787   Wee shall haue each a hundred English men.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1788   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1789   <D {Chorus}.>
1790   Now entertaine coniecture of a time,
1791   When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
1792   Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse.
1793  *From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night
1794   The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds;
1795   That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
1796   The secret Whispers of each others Watch.
1797   Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
1798   Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.
1799   Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs
1800   Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,
1801   The Armourers accomplishing the Knights,
1802   With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp,
1803   Giue dreadfull note of preparation.
1804   The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle:
1805   And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd,
1806   Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule,
1807   The confident and ouer- lustie French,
1808   Doe the low- rated English play at Dice;
1809   And chide the creeple- tardy- gated Night,
1810   Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
1811   So tediously away. The poore condemned English,
1812   Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires
1813   Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
1814   The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad,
1815  *Inuesting lanke- leane Cheekes, and Warre- worne Coats,
1816   Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
1817   So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold
1818   The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band
1819   Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent;
1820   Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head:
1821   For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast,
1822   Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,
1823   And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen.
1824   Vpon his Royall Face there is no note,
1825   How dread an Army hath enrounded him;
1826   Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
1827   Vnto the wearie and all- watched Night:
1828   But freshly lookes, and ouer- beares Attaint,
1829   With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie:
1830   That euery Wretch, pining and pale before,
1831   Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes.
1832   A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne,
1833   His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one,
1834   Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all
1835   Behold, as may vnworthinesse define.
1836   A little touch of {Harry} in the Night,
1837   And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye:
1838   Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace,
1839   With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles,
1840   (Right #ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous)
1841   The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see,
1842   Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee.
1843   <D {Exit}.>
1844   <D {Enter the King, Bedford, and Gloucester}.>
1845   <S {King}.> {Gloster}, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
1846   The greater therefore should our Courage be.
1847   God morrow Brother {Bedford}: God Almightie,
1848   There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
1849   Would men obseruingly distill it out.
1850   For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
1851   Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
1852   Besides, they are our outward Consciences,
1853   And Preachers to vs all; admonishing,
1854   That we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
1855   Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed,
1856   And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe.
1857   <D {Enter Erpingham}.>
1858   Good morrow old Sir {Thomas Erpingham}:
1859   A good soft Pillow for that good white Head,
1860   Were better then a churlish turfe of France.
1861  *<S {Erping}.> Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better,
1862   Since I may say, now lye I like a King.
1863   <S {King}.> 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines,
1864   Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased:
1865   And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt
1866   The Organs, though defunct and dead before,
1867   Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue
1868   With casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
1869   Lend me thy Cloake Sir {Thomas}: Brothers both,
1870   Commend me to the Princes in our Campe;
1871   Doe my good morrow to them, and anon
1872   Desire them all to my Pauillion.
1873   <S {Gloster}.> We shall, my Liege.
1874   <S {Erping}.> Shall I attend your Grace?
1875   <S {King}.> No, my good Knight:
1876   Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England:
1877   I and my Bosome must debate #a while,
1878   And then I would no other company.
1879  *<S {Erping}.> The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble
1880   {Harry}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1881  *<S {King}.> God #a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st cheare-fully.
1882   <D {Enter Pistoll}.>
1883   <S {Pist}.> {Che vous la}?
1884   <S {King}.> A friend.
1885  *<S {Pist}.> Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou
1886   base, common, and popular?
1887   <S {King}.> I am a Gentleman of a Company.
1888   <S {Pist}.> Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke?
1889   <S {King}.> Euen so: what are you?
1890   <S {Pist}.> As good a Gentleman as the Emperor.
1891   <S {King}.> Then you are a better then the King.
1892  *<S {Pist}.> The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a
1893  *Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist
1894  *most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heart-string
1895   I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name?
1896   <S {King}.> {Harry le Roy}.
1897  *<S {Pist}.> {Le Roy}? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew?
1898   <S {King}.> No, I am a Welchman.
1899   <S {Pist}.> Know'st thou {Fluellen}?
1900   <S {King}.> Yes.
1901  *<S {Pist}.> Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon
1902   S[aint]. {Dauies} day.
1903  *<S {King}.> Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe
1904   that day, least he knock that about yours.
      <P i2v>
1905   <S {Pist}.> Art thou his friend?
1906   <S {King}.> And his Kinsman too.
1907   <S {Pist}.> The {Figo} for thee then.
1908   <S {King}.> I thanke you: God be with you.
1909   <S {Pist}.> My name is {Pistol} call'd.  <D {Exit}.>
1910   <S {King}.> It sorts well with your fiercenesse.
1911   <D {Manet King}.>
1912   <D {Enter Fluellen and Gower}.>
1913   <S {Gower}.> Captaine {Fluellen}.
1914  *<S {Flu}.> 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it
1915  *is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when
1916  *the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
1917  *Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to
1918  *examine the Warres of {Pompey} the Great, you shall finde,
1919  *I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble ba-ble
1920  *in {Pompeyes} Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde
1921  *the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and
1922  *the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie
1923   of it, to be otherwise.
1924  *<S {Gower}.> Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all
1925   Night.
1926  *<S {Flu}.> If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a pra-ting
1927  *Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should
1928  *also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Cox-combe,
1929   in your owne conscience now?
1930   <S {Gow}.> I will speake lower.
1931  *<S {Flu}.> I pray you, and beseech you, that you will.  <D {Exit}.>
1932   <S {King}.> Though it appeare a little out of fashion,
1933   There is much care and valour in this Welchman.
1934   <D {Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court},
1935   {and Michael Williams}.>
1936  *<S {Court}.> Brother {Iohn Bates}, is not that the Morning
1937   which breakes yonder?
1938  *<S {Bates}.> I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to
1939   desire the approach of day.
1940  *<S {Williams}.> Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,
1941  *but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes
1942   there?
1943   <S {King}.> A Friend.
1944   <S {Williams}.> Vnder what Captaine serue you?
1945   <S {King}.> Vnder Sir {Iohn Erpingham}.
1946  *<S {Williams}.> A good old Commander, and a most kinde
1947   Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?
1948  *<S {King}.> Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to
1949   be washt off the next Tyde.
1950   <S {Bates}.> He hath not told his thought to the King?
1951  *<S {King}.> No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
1952  *speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
1953  *the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
1954  *shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
1955  *humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Na-kednesse
1956  *he appeares but a man; and though his affecti-ons
1957  *are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
1958  *they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
1959  *reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
1960  *the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
1961  *possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
1962   shewing it, should dis- hearten his Army.
1963  *<S {Bates}.> He may shew what outward courage he will:
1964  *but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish him-selfe
1965  *in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
1966   and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here.
1967  *<S {King}.> By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
1968  *King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
1969   but where hee is.
1970  *<S {Bates}.> Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
1971   sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued.
1972  *<S {King}.> I dare say, you loue him not so #ill, to wish him
1973  *here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
1974  *mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so con-tented,
1975  *as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
1976   his Quarrell honorable.
1977   <S {Williams}.> That's more then we know.
1978  *<S {Bates}.> #I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
1979  *know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
1980  *if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
1981   the Cryme of it out of vs.
1982  *<S {Williams}.> But if the Cause be not good, the King him-selfe
1983  *hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
1984  *Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
1985  *shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dy-ed
1986  *at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Sur-gean;
1987  *some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
1988  *some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
1989  *rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
1990  *in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
1991  *thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
1992  *doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
1993  *that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all pro-portion
1994   of subiection.
1995  *<S {King}.> So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
1996  *Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the im-putation
1997  *of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be im-posed
1998  *vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vn-der
1999  *his Masters command, transporting a summe of Mo-ney,
2000  *be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
2001  *Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
2002  *author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
2003  *The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
2004  *of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
2005  *of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
2006  *they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
2007  *his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitre-ment
2008  *of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Soul-diers:
2009  *some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
2010  *premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of begui-ling
2011  *Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
2012  *making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before go-red
2013  *the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robbe-rie.
2014  *Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and out-runne
2015  *Natiue punishment; though they can out- strip
2016  *men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
2017  *his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
2018  *are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
2019  *now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
2020  *they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
2021  *safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
2022  *is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was be-fore
2023  *guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
2024  *now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
2025  *euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
2026  *euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
2027  *his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
2028  *dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
2029  *the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
2030  *gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
2031  *thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him out-liue
2032  *that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
2033   how they should prepare.
      <P i3>
2034  *<S {Will}.> 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes #ill, the #ill vpon
2035   his owne head, the King is not to answer it.
2036  *<S {Bates}.> I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and
2037   yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
2038  *<S {King}.> I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
2039   ransom'd.
2040  *<S {Will}.> #I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
2041  *when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
2042   ne're the wiser.
2043  *<S {King}.> If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word af-ter.
2044  _
2045  *<S {Will}.> You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
2046  *of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
2047  *can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
2048  *to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
2049  *Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
2050   come, 'tis a foolish saying.
2051  *<S {King}.> Your reproofe is something too round, I should
2052   be angry with you, if the time were conuenient.
2053  *<S {Will}.> Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you
2054   liue.
2055   <S {King}.> I embrace it.
2056   <S {Will}.> How shall I know thee againe?
2057  *<S {King}.> Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it
2058  *in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,
2059   I will make it my Quarrell.
2060  *<S {Will}.> Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of
2061   thine.
2062   <S {King}.> There.
2063  *<S {Will}.> This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou
2064  *come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue,
2065   by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare.
2066   <S {King}.> If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it.
2067   <S {Will}.> Thou dar'st as well be hang'd.
2068  *<S {King}.> Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the
2069   Kings companie.
2070   <S {Will}.> Keepe thy word: fare thee well.
2071  *<S {Bates}.> Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee
2072  *haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to rec-kon.
2073   <D {Exit Souldiers}.>
2074  *<S {King}.> Indeede the French may lay twentie French
2075  *Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them
2076  *on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut
2077  *French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will
2078   be a Clipper.
2079   Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules,
2080   Our Debts, our carefull Wiues,
2081   Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King:
2082   We must beare all.
2083   O hard Condition, Twin- borne with Greatnesse,
2084   Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence
2085   No more can feele, but his owne wringing.
2086   What infinite hearts- ease must Kings neglect,
2087   That priuate men enioy?
2088   And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too,
2089   Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie?
2090   And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie?
2091   What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more
2092   Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers.
2093   What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in?
2094   O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.
2095   What? is thy Soule of Odoration?
2096   Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,
2097   Creating awe and feare in other men?
2098   Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,
2099   Then they in fearing.
2100   What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,
2101   But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,
2102   And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.
2103   Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
2104   With Titles blowne from Adulation?
2105   Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?
2106   Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,
2107   Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,
2108   That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.
2109   I am a King that find thee: and I know,
2110   'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,
2111   The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,
2112   The enter- tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,
2113   The farsed Title running 'fore the King,
2114   The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,
2115   That beates vpon the high shore of this World:
2116   No, not all these, thrice- gorgeous Ceremonie;
2117   Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,
2118   Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:
2119   Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,
2120   Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,
2121   Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of #Hell:
2122   But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,
2123   Sweates in the eye of {Phebus}; and all Night
2124   Sleepes in {Elizium}: next day after dawne,
2125   Doth rise and helpe {Hiperio[n]} to his Horse,
2126   And followes so the euer- running yeere
2127   With profitable labour to his Graue:
2128   And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,
2129   Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,
2130   Had the fore- hand and vantage of a King.
2131   The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,
2132   Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,
2133   What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace;
2134   Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.
2135   <D {Enter Erpingham}.>
2136   <S {Erp}.> My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence,
2137   Seeke through your Campe to find you.
2138   <S {King}.> Good old Knight, collect them all together
2139   At my Tent: Ile be before thee.
2140   <S {Erp}.> I shall doo't, my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
2141   <S {King}.> O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts,
2142   Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
2143   The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
2144   Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,
2145   O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault
2146   My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.
2147   I {Richards} body haue interred new,
2148   And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
2149   Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
2150   Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,
2151   Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp
2152   Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:
2153   And I haue built two Chauntries,
2154   Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still
2155   For {Richards} Soule. More will I doe:
2156   Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth;
2157   Since that my Penitence comes after all,
2158   Imploring pardon.
2159   <D {Enter Gloucester}.>
2160   <S {Glouc}.> My Liege.
2161   <S {King}.> My Brother {Gloucesters} voyce? #I:
2162   I know thy errand, I will goe with thee:
2163   The day, my friend, and all things stay for me.
2164   <D {Exeunt}.>

2165   <D {Enter the Dolphin, Orleance, Ramburs, and}
2166   {Beaumont}.>
2167  *<S {Orleance}.> The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my

2174   <S {Dolph}.> {Cein}, Cousin {Orleance}.  <D {Enter Constable}.>
2175   Now my Lord Constable?
2176  *<S {Const}.> Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice
2177   neigh.
2178  *<S {Dolph}.> Mount them, and make incision in their Hides,
2179   That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
2180   And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha.
2181  *<S {Ram}.> What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood?
2182   How shall we then behold their naturall teares?
2183   <D {Enter Messenger}.>
2184  *<S {Messeng}.> The English are embattail'd, you French
2185   Peeres.
2186  *<S {Const}.> To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse.
2187   Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band,
2188   And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules,
2189   Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men.
2190   There is not worke enough for all our hands,
2191   Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines,
2192   To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne,
2193   That our French Gallants shall to day draw out,
2194   And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them,
2195   The vapour of our Valour will o're- turne them.
2196   'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords,
2197   That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants,
2198   Who in vnnecessarie action swarme
2199   About our Squares of Battaile, were enow
2200   To purge this field of such a hilding Foe;
2201   Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by,
2202   Tooke stand for idle speculation:
2203   But that our Honours must not. What's to say?
2204   A very little little let vs doe,
2205   And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound
2206   The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount:
2207   For our approach shall so much dare the field,
2208   That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld.
2209   <D {Enter Graundpree}.>
2210  *<S {Grandpree}.> Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France?
2211   Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones,
2212   Ill- fauoredly become the Morning field:
2213   Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
2214   And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully.
2215  *Bigge {Mars} seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
2216   And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes.
2217   The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
2218   With Torch- staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
2219   Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
2220   The gumme downe roping from their pale- dead eyes,
2221   And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
2222   Lyes foule with chaw'd- grasse, still and motionlesse.
2223   And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
2224   Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
2225   Description cannot sute it selfe in words,
2226   To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile,
2227   In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe.
2228   <S {Const}.> They haue said their prayers,
2229   And they stay for death.
2230  *<S {Dolph}.> Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes,
2231   And giue their fasting Horses Prouender,
2232   And after fight with them?
2233   <S {Const}.> I stay but for my Guard: on
2234   To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take,
2235   And vse it for my haste. Come, come away,
2236   The Sunne is high, and we out- weare the day.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2237   <D {Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham}
2238   {with all his Hoast: Salisbury, and}
2239   {Westmerland}.>
2240   <S {Glouc}.> Where is the King?
2241  *<S {Bedf}.> The King himselfe is rode to view their Bat-taile.
2242  _
2243  *<S {West}.> Of fighting men they haue full threescore thou-sand.
2244  _
2245   <S {Exe}.> There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh.
2246  *<S {Salisb}.> Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes.
2247   God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge:
2248   If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen;
2249   Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford,
2250   My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
2251   And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu.
2252  *<S {Bedf}.> Farwell good {Salisbury}, & good luck go with thee:
2253   And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it,
2254   For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour.
2255   <S {Exe}.> Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day.
2256   <S {Bedf}.> He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse,
2257   Princely in both.
2258   <D {Enter the King}.>
2259   <S {West}.> O that we now had here
2260   But one ten thousand of those men in England,
2261   That doe no worke to day.
2262   <S {King}.> What's he that wishes so?
2263   My Cousin {Westmerland}. No, my faire Cousin:
2264   If we are markt to dye, we are enow
2265   To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
2266   The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
2267   Gods #will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
2268   By {Ioue}, I am not couetous for Gold,
2269   Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
2270   It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
2271   Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
2272   But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
2273   I am the most offending Soule aliue.
2274   No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:
2275   Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,
2276   As one man more me thinkes would share from me,
2277   For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:
2278   Rather proclaime it ({Westmerland}) through my Hoast,
2279   That he which hath no stomack to this fight,
2280   Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,
2281   And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:
2282   We would not dye in that mans companie,
2283   That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.
2284   This day is call'd the Feast of {Crispian}:
2285   He that out- liues this day, and comes safe home,
2286   Will stand a tip- toe when this day is named,
2287   And rowse him at the Name of {Crispian}.
2288   He that shall see this day, and liue old age,
2289   Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,
2290   And say, to morrow is Saint {Crispian}.
2291   Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:
2292   Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:
2293   But hee'le remember, with aduantages,
2294   What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,
2295   Familiar in his mouth as household words,
      <P i4>
2296   {Harry} the King, {Bedford} and {Exeter},
2297   {Warwick} and {Talbot}, {Salisbury} and {Gloucester},
2298   Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.
2299   This story shall the good man teach his sonne:
2300   And {Crispine Crispian} shall ne're goe by,
2301   From this day to the ending of the World,
2302   But we in it shall be remembred;
2303   We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
2304   For he to day that sheds his blood with me,
2305   Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,
2306   This day shall gentle his Condition.
2307   And Gentlemen in England, now #a bed,
2308   Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;
2309   And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes,
2310   That fought with vs vpon Saint {Crispines} day.
2311   <D {Enter Salisbury}.>
2312  *<S {Sal}.> My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed:
2313   The French are brauely in their battailes set,
2314   And will with all expedience charge on vs.
2315   <S {King}.> All things are ready, if our minds be so.
2316   <S {West}.> Perish the man, whose mind is backward now.
2317  *<S {King}.> Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England,
2318   Couze?
2319   <S {West}.> Gods #will, my Liege, would you and I alone,
2320   Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile.
2321  *<S {King}.> Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men:
2322   Which likes me better, then to wish vs one.
2323   You know your places: God be with you all.
2324   <D {Tucket. Enter Montioy}.>
2325  *<S {Mont}.> Once more I come to know of thee King {Harry},
2326   If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,
2327   Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:
2328   For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,
2329   Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy
2330   The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind
2331   Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules
2332   May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre
2333  *From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies
2334   Must lye and fester.
2335   <S {King}.> Who hath sent thee now?
2336   <S {Mont}.> The Constable of France.
2337   <S {King}.> I pray thee beare my former Answer back:
2338   Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.
2339  *Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?
2340   The man that once did sell the Lyons skin
2341   While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
2342   A many of our bodyes shall no doubt
2343   Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust
2344   Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.
2345   And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,
2346   Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,
2347   They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,
2348   And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,
2349   Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,
2350   The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.
2351   Marke then abounding valour in our English:
2352   That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,
2353   Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,
2354   Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.
2355   Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,
2356   We are but Warriors for the working day:
2357   Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht
2358   With raynie Marching in the painefull field.
2359   There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:
2360   Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:
2361   And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.
2362   But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:
2363   And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,
2364   They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck
2365   The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,
2366   And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,
2367   As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then
2368   Will soone be leuyed.
2369   Herauld, saue thou thy labour:
2370   Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,
2371   They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:
2372   Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,
2373   Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable.
2374   <S {Mont}.> I shall, King {Harry}. And so fare thee well:
2375   Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more.  <D {Exit}.>
2376  *<S {King}.> I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a
2377   Ransome.
2378   <D {Enter Yorke}.>
2379   <S {Yorke}.> My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge
2380   The leading of the Vaward.
2381   <S {King}.> Take it, braue {Yorke}.
2382   Now Souldiers march away,
2383   And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2384   <D {Alarum. Excursions}.
2385   {Enter Pistoll, French Souldier, Boy}.>
2386   <S {Pist}.> Yeeld Curre.
2387  *<S {French}.> {Ie pense que vous estes le Gentilhome de bon qua-litee}.
2388  _
2389  *<S {Pist}.> Qualtitie calmie custure me. Art thou a Gentle-man?
2390   What is thy Name? discusse.
2391   <S {French}.> {O Seigneur Dieu}.
2392  *<S {Pist}.> O Signieur Dewe should be a Gentleman: per-pend
2393  *my words O Signieur Dewe, and marke: O Signieur
2394  *Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur
2395   thou doe giue to me egregious Ransome.
2396   <S {French}.> {O prennes miserecordie aye pitez de moy}.
2397  *<S {Pist}.> Moy shall not serue, I will haue fortie Moyes: for
2398  *I will fetch thy rymme out at thy Throat, in droppes of
2399   Crimson blood.
2400   <S {French}.> {Est il impossible d' eschapper le force de ton bras}.
2401  *<S {Pist}.> Brasse, Curre? thou damned and luxurious Moun-taine
2402   Goat, offer'st me Brasse?
2403   <S {French}.> {O perdonne moy}.
2404  *<S {Pist}.> Say'st thou me so? is that a Tonne of Moyes?
2405  *Come hither boy, aske me this slaue in French what is his
2406   Name.
2407   <S {Boy}.> {Escoute comment estes vous appelle?}
2408   <S {French}.> {Mounsieur le Fer}.
2409   <S {Boy}.> He sayes his Name is M. {Fer}.
2410  *<S {Pist}.> M. {Fer}: Ile fer him, and firke him, and ferret him:
2411   discusse the same in French vnto him.
2412  *<S {Boy}.> I doe not know the French for fer, and ferret, and
2413   firke.
2414   <S {Pist}.> Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat.
2415   <S {French}.> {Que dit il Mounsieur}?
2416  *<S {Boy}.> {Il me commande a vous dire que vous faite vous}
2417  *{prest, car ce soldat icy est disposee tout asture de couppes vostre}
2418   {gorge}.
2419  *<S {Pist}.> Owy, cuppele gorge permafoy pesant, vnlesse
2420  *thou giue me Crownes, braue Crownes; or mangled shalt
2421   thou be by this my Sword.
2422  *<S {French}.> {O Ie vous supplie pour l' amour de Dieu: ma par-donner},
2423  *{Ie suis le Gentilhome de bon maison, garde ma vie, & Ie}
2424   {vous donneray deux cent escus}.
2425   <S {Pist}.> What are his words?
      <P i4v><C B>
2426  *<S {Boy}.> He prayes you to saue his life, he is a Gentleman
2427  *of a good house, and for his ransom he will giue you two
2428   hundred Crownes.
2429  *<S {Pist}.> Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the Crownes
2430   will take.
2431   <S {Fren}.> {Petit Monsieur que dit il?}
2432  *<S {Boy}.> {Encore qu'il et contra son Iurement, de pardonner au-cune}
2433  *{prisonner: neant-mons pour les escues que vous layt a pro-mets},
2434   {il est content a vous donnes le liberte le franchisement}.
2435  *<S {Fre}.> {Sur mes genoux se vous donnes milles remercious, et}
2436  *{Ie me estime heurex que Ie intombe, entre les main d' vn Che-ualier}
2437  *{Ie pense le plus braue valiant et tres distime signieur}
2438   {d' Angleterre}.
2439   <S {Pist}.> Expound vnto me boy.
2440  *<S {Boy}.> He giues you vpon his knees a thousand thanks,
2441  *and he esteemes himselfe happy, that he hath falne into
2442  *the hands of one (as he thinkes) the most braue, valorous
2443   and thrice- worthy signeur of England.
2444  *<S {Pist}.> As I sucke blood, I will some mercy shew. Fol-low
2445   mee.
2446   <S {Boy}.> {Saaue vous le grand Capitaine?}
2447  *I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a
2448  *heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the
2449  *greatest sound, {Bardolfe} and {Nym} had tenne times more
2450  *valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie
2451  *one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and
2452  *they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst
2453  *steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the
2454  *Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might
2455  *haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none
2456   to guard it but boyes.  <D {Exit}.>
2457   <D {Enter Constable, Orleance, Burbon, Dolphin,}
2458   {and Rambures}.>
2459   <S {Con}.> {O Diable}.
2460   <S {Orl}.> {O signeur le iour et perdia, toute et perdie}.
2461   <S {Dol}.> {Mor Dieu ma vie}, all is confounded all,
2462   Reproach, and euerlasting shame
2463   Sits mocking in our Plumes. <D {A short Alarum}.>
2464   {O meschante Fortune}, do not runne away.
2465   <S {Con}.> Why all our rankes are broke.
2466   <S {Dol}.> O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues:
2467   Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
2468   <S {Orl}.> Is this the King we sent #too, for his ransome?
2469  *<S {Bur}.> Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
2470   Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
2471   And he that will not follow {Burbon} now,
2472   Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
2473   Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
2474   Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
2475   His fairest daughter is contaminated.
2476   <S {Con}.> Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now,
2477   Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues.
2478   <S {Orl}.> We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
2479   To smother vp the English in our throngs,
2480   If any order might be thought vpon.
2481   <S {Bur}.> The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
2482   Let life be short, else shame will be too long.  <D {Exit}.>
2483   <D {Alarum. Enter the King and his trayne},
2484   {with Prisoners}.>
2485  *<S {King}.> Well haue we done, thrice- valiant Countrimen,
2486   But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field.
2487  *<S {Exe}.> The D[uke]. of York commends him to your Maiesty
2488  *<S {King}.> Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre
2489   I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting,
2490   From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was.
2491   <S {Exe}.> In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye,
2492   Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side,
2493   (Yoake- fellow to his honour- owing- wounds)
2494   The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.
2495   Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer
2496   Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
2497   And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes
2498   That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.
2499   He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,
2500   My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:
2501   Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a- brest:
2502   As in this glorious and well- foughten field
2503   We kept together in our Chiualrie.
2504   Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,
2505   He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
2506   And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,
2507   Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,
2508   So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke
2509   He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,
2510   And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
2511   A Testament of Noble- ending- loue:
2512   The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd
2513   Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,
2514   But I had not so much of man in mee,
2515   And all my mother came into mine eyes,
2516   And gaue me vp to teares.
2517   <S {King}.> I blame you not,
2518   For hearing this, I must perforce compound
2519   With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue #to. <D  {Alarum}>
2520   But hearke, what new alarum is this same?
2521   The French haue re- enforc'd their scatter'd men:
2522   Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,
2523   Giue the word through.  <D {Exit}>
2524   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
2525   <D {Enter Fluellen and Gower}.>
2526  *<S {Flu}.> Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
2527  *against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knaue-ry
2528  *marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
2529   now, is it not?
2530  *<S {Gow}.> Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
2531  *Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile #ha' done
2532  *this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried a-way
2533  *all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
2534  *most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his pri-soners
2535   throat. O 'tis a gallant King.
2536  *<S {Flu}.> #I, hee was porne at {Monmouth} Captaine {Gower}:
2537  *What call you the Townes name where {Alexander} the
2538   pig was borne?
2539   <S {Gow}.> {Alexander} the Great.
2540  *<S {Flu}.> Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
2541  *the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnani-mous,
2542  *are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle va-riations.
2543  _
2544  *<S {Gower}.> I thinke {Alexander} the Great was borne in
2545  *{Macedon}, his Father was called {Phillip} of {Macedon}, as I
2546   take it.
2547  *<S {Flu}.> I thinke it is in {Macedon} where {Alexander} is
      <P i5>
2548  *porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
2549  *the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons be-tweene
2550  *{Macedon} & {Monmouth}, that the situations looke
2551  *you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in {Macedon}, & there
2552  *is also moreouer a Riuer at {Monmouth}, it is call'd Wye at
2553  *{Monmouth}: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
2554  *of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
2555  *is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
2556  *marke {Alexanders} life well, {Harry of Monmouthes} life is
2557  *come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
2558  *things. {Alexander} God knowes, and you know, in his
2559  *rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
2560  *his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
2561  *and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
2562  *his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
2563   {Clytus}.
2564  *<S {Gow}.> Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
2565   any of his friends.
2566  *<S {Flu}.> It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
2567  *tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
2568  *but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as {Alexander}
2569  *kild his friend {Clytus}, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
2570  *also {Harry Monmouth} being in his right wittes, and his
2571  *good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
2572  *great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
2573   knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name.
2574   <S {Gow}.> Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}.
2575  *<S {Flu}.> That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
2576   at {Monmouth}.
2577   <S {Gow}.> Heere comes his Maiesty.
2578   <D {Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon}
2579   {with prisoners. Flourish}.>
2580   <S {King}.> I was not angry since I came to France,
2581   Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,
2582   Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:
2583   If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,
2584   Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.
2585   If they'l do neither, we will come to them,
2586   And make them sker away, as swift as stones
2587   Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
2588   Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,
2589   And not a man of them that we shall take,
2590   Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
2591   <D {Enter Montioy}.>
2592  *<S {Exe}.> Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege
2593   <S {Glou}.> His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be.
2594  *<S {King}.> How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst
2595   thou not,
2596   That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?
2597   Com'st thou againe for ransome?
2598   <S {Her}.> No great King:
2599   I come to thee for charitable License,
2600   That we may wander ore this bloody field,
2601   To booke our dead, and then to bury them,
2602   To sort our Nobles from our common men.
2603   For many of our Princes (woe the while)
2604   Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:
2605   So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes
2606   In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds
2607   Fret fet- locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage
2608   Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,
2609   Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,
2610   To view the field in safety, and dispose
2611   Of their dead bodies.
2612   <S {Kin}.> I tell thee truly Herald,
2613   I know not if the day be ours or no,
2614   For yet a many of your horsemen peere,
2615   And gallop ore the field.
2616   <S {Her}.> The day is yours.
2617   <S {Kin}.> Praised be God, and not our strength for it:
2618   What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by.
2619   <S {Her}.> They call it {Agincourt}.
2620   <S {King}.> Then call we this the field of {Agincourt},
2621   Fought on the day of {Crispin Crispianus}.
2622  *<S {Flu}.> Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please
2623  *your Maiesty) and your great Vncle {Edward} the Placke
2624  *Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought
2625   a most praue pattle here in France.
2626   <S {Kin}.> They did {Fluellen}.
2627  *<S {Flu}.> Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties
2628  *is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a
2629  *Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their
2630  *{Monmouth} caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre
2631  *is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue
2632  *your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon
2633   S[aint]. Tauies day.
2634   <S {King}.> I weare it for a memorable honor:
2635   For I am Welch you know good Countriman.
2636  *<S {Flu}.> All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maie-sties
2637  *Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
2638  *God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his
2639   Grace, and his Maiesty too.
2640   <S {Kin}.> Thankes good my Countrymen.
2641  *<S {Flu}.> By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I
2642  *care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I
2643  *need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God
2644   so long as your Maiesty is an honest man.
2645   <S {King}.> Good keepe me so.
2646   <D {Enter Williams}.>
2647   Our Heralds go with him,
2648   Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead
2649   On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.
2650   <S {Exe}.> Souldier, you must come to the King.
2651   <S {Kin}.> Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy
2652   Cappe?
2653  *<S {Will}.> And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one
2654   that I should fight withall, if he be aliue.
2655   <S {Kin}.> An Englishman?
2656  *<S {Wil}.> And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swag-ger'd
2657  *with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to
2658  *challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe
2659  *a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he
2660  *swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil
2661   strike it out soundly.
2662  *<S {Kin}.> What thinke you Captaine {Fluellen}, is it fit this
2663   souldier keepe his oath.
2664  *<S {Flu}.> Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please
2665   your Maiesty in my conscience.
2666  *<S {King}.> It may bee, his enemy is a Gentleman of great
2667   sort quite from the answer of his degree.
2668  *<S {Flu}.> Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is,
2669  *as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke
2670  *your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee
2671  *bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a
2672  *villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd
2673  *vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law
2674  *<S {King}.> Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st
2675   the fellow.
2676   <S {Wil}.> So, I wil my Liege, as I liue.
2677   <S {King}.> Who seru'st thou vnder?
      <P i5v><C A>
2678   <S {Will}.> Vnder Captaine {Gower}, my Liege.
2679  *<S {Flu}.> {Gower} is a good Captaine, and is good know-ledge
2680   and literatured in the Warres.
2681   <S {King}.> Call him hither to me, Souldier.
2682   <S {Will}.> I will my Liege.  <D {Exit}.>
2683  *<S {King}.> Here {Fluellen}, weare thou this fauour for me, and
2684  *sticke it in thy Cappe: when {Alanson} and my selfe were
2685  *downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If
2686  *any man challenge this, hee is a friend to {Alanson}, and an
2687  *enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, appre-hend
2688   him, #and thou do'st me loue.
2689  *<S {Flu}.> Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be
2690  *desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see
2691  *the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe
2692  *agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see
2693   it once, and please God of his grace that I might see.
2694   <S {King}.> Know'st thou {Gower}?
2695   <S {Flu}.> He is my deare friend, #and please you.
2696  *<S {King}.> Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my
2697   Tent.
2698   <S {Flu}.> I will fetch him.  <D {Exit}.>
2699   <S {King}.> My Lord of {Warwick}, and my Brother {Gloster},
2700   Follow {Fluellen} closely at the heeles.
2701   The Gloue which I haue giuen him for a fauour,
2702   May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare.
2703   It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
2704   Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin {Warwick}:
2705   If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge
2706   By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word;
2707   Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it:
2708   For I doe know {Fluellen} valiant,
2709   And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder,
2710   And quickly will returne an iniurie.
2711   Follow, and see there be no harme betweene them.
2712   Goe you with me, Vnckle of Exeter.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2713   <D {Enter Gower and Williams}.>
2714   <S {Will}.> I warrant it is to Knight you, Captaine.
2715   <D {Enter Fluellen}.>
2716  *<S {Flu}.> Gods #will, and his pleasure, Captaine, I beseech
2717  *you now, come apace to the King: there is more good
2718  *toward you peraduenture, then is in your knowledge to
2719   dreame of.
2720   <S {Will}.> Sir, know you this Gloue?
2721   <S {Flu}.> Know the Gloue? I know the Gloue is a Gloue.
2722   <S {Will}.> I know this, and thus I challenge it.
2723   <D {Strikes him}.>
2724  *<S {Flu}.> 'Sblud, an arrant Traytor as anyes in the Vniuer-sall
2725   World, or in France, or in England.
2726   <S {Gower}.> How now Sir? you Villaine.
2727   <S {Will}.> Doe you thinke Ile be forsworne?
2728  *<S {Flu}.> Stand away Captaine {Gower}, I will giue Treason
2729   his payment into plowes, I warrant you.
2730   <S {Will}.> I am no Traytor.
2731  *<S {Flu}.> That's a Lye in thy Throat. I charge you in his
2732  *Maiesties Name apprehend him, he's a friend of the Duke
2733   {Alansons}.
2734   <D {Enter Warwick and Gloucester}.>
2735   <S {Warw}.> How now, how now, what's the matter?

2739   Maiestie.  <D {Enter King and Exeter}.>
2740   <S {King}.> How now, what's the matter?
2741  *<S {Flu}.> My Liege, heere is a Villaine, and a Traytor,
2742  *that looke your Grace, ha's strooke the Gloue which
2743  *your Maiestie is take out of the Helmet of {Alan-son}.
2744  _
2745  *<S {Will}.> My Liege, this was my Gloue, here is the fellow
2746  *of it: and he that I gaue it to in change, promis'd to weare
2747  *it in his Cappe: I promis'd to strike him, if he did: I met
2748  *this man with my Gloue in his Cappe, and I haue been as
2749   good as my word.
2750  *<S {Flu}.> Your Maiestie heare now, sauing your Maiesties
2751  *Manhood, what an arrant rascally, beggerly, lowsie
2752  *Knaue it is: I hope your Maiestie is peare me testimonie

2758   'Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike,
2759   And thou hast giuen me most bitter termes.
2760  *<S {Flu}.> #And please your Maiestie, let his Neck answere
2761   for it, if there is any Marshall Law in the World.
2762   <S {King}.> How canst thou make me satisfaction?
2763  *<S {Will}.> All offences, my Lord, come from the heart: ne-uer
2764  *came any from mine, that might offend your Ma-iestie.
2765  _
2766   <S {King}.> It was our selfe thou didst abuse.
2767  *<S {Will}.> Your Maiestie came not like your selfe: you
2768  *appear'd to me but as a common man; witnesse the
2769  *Night, your Garments, your Lowlinesse: and what
2770  *your Highnesse suffer'd vnder that shape, I beseech you
2771  *take it for your owne fault, and not mine: for had you
2772  *beene as I tooke you for, I made no offence; therefore I
2773   beseech your Highnesse pardon me.
2774  *<S {King}.> Here Vnckle {Exeter}, fill this Gloue with Crownes,
2775   And giue it to this fellow. Keepe it fellow,
2776   And weare it for an Honor in thy Cappe,
2777   Till I doe challenge it. Giue him the Crownes:
2778   And Captaine, you must needs be friends with him.
2779  *<S {Flu}.> By this Day and this Light, the fellow ha's met-tell
2780  *enough in his belly: Hold, there is twelue- pence for
2781  *you, and I pray you to serue God, and keepe you out of
2782  *prawles and prabbles, and quarrels and dissentions, and I
2783   warrant you it is the better for you.

2785  *<S {Flu}.> It is with a good #will: I can tell you it will serue

2789   <D {Enter Herauld}.>
2790   <S {King}.> Now Herauld, are the dead numbred?
2791  *<S {Herald}.> Heere is the number of the slaught'red
2792   French.
2793  *<S {King}.> What Prisoners of good sort are taken,
2794   Vnckle?

2797   Of other Lords and Barons, Knights and Squires,
2798   Full fifteene hundred, besides common men.
2799  *<S {King}.> This Note doth tell me of ten thousand French
2800   That in the field lye slaine: of Princes in this number,
2801   And Nobles bearing Banners, there lye dead
2802   One hundred twentie six: added to these,
2803   Of Knights, Esquires, and gallant Gentlemen,
2804   Eight thousand and foure hundred: of the which,
2805   Fiue hundred were but yesterday dubb'd Knights.
2806   So that in these ten thousand they haue lost,
2807   There are but sixteene hundred Mercenaries:
2808   The rest are Princes, Barons, Lords, Knights, Squires,
      <P i6>
2809   And Gentlemen of bloud and qualitie.

2818   {#Grandpree} and {Roussie, Fauconbridge} and {Foyes},
2819   {Beaumont} and {Marle, Vandemont} and {Lestrale}.
2820   Here was a Royall fellowship of death.
2821   Where is the number of our English dead?
2822   {Edward} the Duke of Yorke, the Earle of Suffolke,
2823   Sir {Richard Ketly, Dauy Gam} Esquire;
2824   None else of name: and of all other men,
2825   But fiue and twentie.
2826   O God, thy Arme was heere:
2827   And not to vs, but to thy Arme alone,
2828   Ascribe we all: when, without stratagem,
2829   But in plaine shock, and euen play of Battaile,
2830   Was euer knowne so great and little losse?
2831   On one part and on th' other, take it God,
2832   For it is none but thine.
2833   <S {Exet}.> 'Tis wonderfull.
2834   <S {King}.> Come, goe we in procession to the Village:
2835   And be it death proclaymed through our Hoast,
2836   To boast of this, or take that prayse from God,
2837   Which is his onely.
2838  *<S {Flu}.> Is it not lawfull #and please your Maiestie, to tell
2839   how many is kill'd?
2840  *<S {King}.> Yes Captaine: but with this acknowledgement,
2841   That God fought for vs.
2842   <S {Flu}.> Yes, my conscience, he did vs great good.
2843   <S {King}.> Doe we all holy Rights:
2844   Let there be sung {Non nobis}, and {Te Deum},
2845   The dead with charitie enclos'd in Clay:
2846   And then to Callice, and to England then,
2847   Where ne're from France arriu'd more happy men.
2848   <D {Exeunt}.>
2849   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2850   <D {Enter Chorus}.>
2851   Vouchsafe to those that haue not read the Story,
2852   That I may prompt them: and of such as haue,
2853   I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse
2854   Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
2855   Which cannot in their huge and proper life,
2856   Be here presented. Now we beare the King
2857   Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene,
2858   Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,
2859   Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach
2860   Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes,
2861   Whose shouts & claps out- voyce the deep- mouth'd Sea,
2862   Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King,
2863   Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land,
2864   And solemnly see him set on to London.
2865   So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now
2866   You may imagine him vpon Black- Heath:
2867   Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne
2868   His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword
2869   Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,
2870   Being free from vain-nesse, and selfe- glorious pride;
2871   Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent,
2872   Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold,
2873   In the quick Forge and working- house of Thought,
2874   How London doth powre out her Citizens,
2875   The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort,
2876   Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome,
2877   With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles,
2878   Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring {Caesar} in:
2879   As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood,
2880   Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse,
2881   As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,
2882   Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;
2883   How many would the peacefull Citie quit,
2884   To welcome him? much more, and much more cause,
2885   Did they this {Harry}. Now in London place him.
2886   As yet the lamentation of the French
2887   Inuites the King of Englands stay at home:
2888   The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France,
2889   To order peace betweene them: and omit
2890   All the occurrences, what euer chanc't,
2891   Till {Harryes} backe returne againe to France:
2892   There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd
2893   The {interim}, by remembring you 'tis past.
2894   Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance,
2895   After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France.
2896   <D {Exit}.>
2897   <D {Enter Fluellen and Gower}.>
2898  *<S {Gower}.> Nay, that's right: but why weare you your
2899   Leeke to day? S[aint]. {Dauies} day is past.
2900  *<S {Flu}.> There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
2901  *in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine
2902  *{#Gower}; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging
2903  *Knaue {Pistoll}, which you and your selfe, and all the World,
2904  *know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no
2905  *merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and
2906  *sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
2907  *it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
2908  *with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
2909  *till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
2910   piece of my desires.
2911   <D {Enter Pistoll}.>
2912  *<S {Gower}.> Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turky-cock.
2913  _
2914  *<S {Flu}.> 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turky-cocks.
2915  *God plesse you aunchient {Pistoll}: you scuruie low-sie
2916   Knaue, God plesse you.
2917  *<S {Pist}.> Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base
2918  *Troian, to haue me fold vp {Parcas} fatall Web? Hence;
2919   I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke.
2920  *<S {Flu}.> I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at
2921  *my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate,
2922  *looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not
2923  *loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your
2924  *disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you
2925   to eate it.
2926   <S {Pist}.> Not for {Cadwallader} and all his Goats.
2927   <S {Flu}.> There is one Goat for you. <D  {Strikes him}.>
2928   Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it?
2929   <S {Pist}.> Base Troian, thou shalt dye.
2930  *<S {Flu}.> You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods
2931  *#will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and
2932  *eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You
2933  *call'd me yesterday Mountaine- Squier, but I will make
      <P i6v><C B>
2934  *you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall #too, if
2935   you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke.
2936   <S {Gour}.> Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him.
2937  *<S {Flu}.> I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
2938  *or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
2939  *good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxe-combe.
2940  _
2941   <S {Pist}.> Must I bite.
2942  *<S {Flu}.> Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of que-stion
2943   too, and ambiguities.
2944  *<S {Pist}.> By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I
2945   eate and eate I sweare.
2946  *<S {Flu}.> Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce
2947  *to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by.
2948   <S {Pist}.> Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate.
2949  *<S {Flu}.> Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
2950  *pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
2951  *broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
2952   Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all.
2953   <S {Pist}.> Good.
2954  *<S {Flu}.> #I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to
2955   heale your pate.
2956   <S {Pist}.> Me a groat?
2957  *<S {Flu}.> Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue
2958   another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate.
2959   <S {Pist}.> I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge.
2960  *<S {Flu}.> If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cud-gels,
2961  *you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
2962  *me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, & heale
2963   your pate.  <D {Exit}>
2964   <S {Pist}.> All #hell shall stirre for this.
2965  *<S {Gow}.> Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
2966  *will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
2967  *honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
2968  *of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
2969  *any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking & galling
2970  *at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
2971  *he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
2972  *not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it o-therwise,
2973  *and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
2974   you a good English condition, fare ye well.  <D {Exit}>
2975  *<S {Pist}.> Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now?
2976  *Newes haue I that my {Doll} is dead i'th Spittle of a mala-dy
2977  *of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off:
2978  *Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is
2979  *Cudgeld. Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to
2980  *Cut- purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and
2981   there Ile steale:
2982   And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres,
2983   And swore I got them in the Gallia warres.  <D {Exit}.>
2984  *<D {Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke},
2985   {and other Lords. At another, Queene Isabel},
2986   {the King, the Duke of Bourgougne, and}
2987   {other French}.>
2988  *<S {King}.> Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met;
2989   Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister
2990   Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes
2991   To our most faire and Princely Cosine {Katherine}:
2992   And as a branch and member of this Royalty,
2993   By whom this great assembly is contriu'd,
2994   We do salute you Duke of {Burgogne},
2995   And Princes French and Peeres health to you all.
2996   <S {Fra}.> Right ioyous are we to behold your face,
2997   Most worthy brother England, fairely met,
2998   So are you Princes (English) euery one.
      <C A>
2999   <S {Quee}.> So happy be the Issue brother Ireland
3000   Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting,
3001   As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
3002   Your eyes which hitherto haue borne
3003  *In them against the French that met them in their bent,
3004   The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:
3005   The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope
3006   Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day
3007   Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue.
3008   <S {Eng}.> To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare.
3009   <S {Quee}.> You English Princes all, I doe salute you.
3010   <S {Burg}.> My dutie to you both, on equall loue.
3011  *Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd
3012   With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,
3013   To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties
3014   Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;
3015   Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.
3016   Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,
3017   That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,
3018   You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,
3019   If I demand before this Royall view,
3020   What Rub, or what Impediment there is,
3021   Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,
3022   Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,
3023   Should not in this best Garden of the World,
3024   Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?
3025   Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,
3026   And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,
3027   Corrupting in #it owne fertilitie.
3028   Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,
3029   Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,
3030   Like Prisoners wildly ouer- growne with hayre,
3031   Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,
3032   The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,
3033   Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,
3034   That should deracinate such Sauagery:
3035   The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth
3036   The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,
3037   Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;
3038   Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,
3039   But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,
3040   Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;
3041   And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,
3042   Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.
3043   Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,
3044   Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,
3045   The Sciences that should become our Countrey;
3046   But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,
3047   That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,
3048   To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,
3049   And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.
3050   Which to reduce into our former fauour,
3051   You are assembled: and my speech entreats,
3052   That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace
3053   Should not expell these inconueniences,
3054   And blesse vs with her former qualities.
3055   <S {Eng}.> If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,
3056   Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections
3057   Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace
3058   With full accord to all our iust demands,
3059   Whose Tenures and particular effects
3060   You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands.
3061  *<S {Burg}.> The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet
3062   There is no Answer made.
3063  *<S {Eng}.> Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,
3064   Lyes in his Answer.
      <P k1>
3065   <S {France}.> I haue but with a curselarie eye
3066   O're- glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace
3067   To appoint some of your Councell presently
3068   To sit with vs once more, with better heed
3069   To re- suruey them; we will suddenly
3070   Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer.
3071   <S {England}.> Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle {Exeter},
3072   And Brother {Clarence}, and you Brother {Gloucester},
3073   {Warwick}, and {Huntington}, goe with the King,
3074   And take with you free power, to ratifie,
3075   Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best
3076   Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,
3077   Any thing in or out of our Demands,
3078   And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,
3079   Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?
3080   <S {Quee}.> Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:
3081   Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,
3082   When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on.
3083   <S {England}.> Yet leaue our Cousin {Katherine} here with vs,
3084   She is our capitall Demand, compris'd
3085   Within the fore- ranke of our Articles.
3086   <S {Quee}.> She hath good leaue.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
3087   <D {Manet King and Katherine}.>
3088   <S {King}.> Faire {Katherine}, and most faire,
3089   Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,
3090   Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,
3091   And pleade his Loue- suit to her gentle heart.
3092  *<S {Kath}.> Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake
3093   your England.
3094  *<S {King}.> O faire {Katherine}, if you will loue me soundly
3095  *with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you con-fesse
3096  *it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
3097   like me, {Kate}?
3098   <S {Kath}.> {Pardonne moy}, I cannot tell wat is like me.
3099  *<S {King}.> An Angell is like you {Kate}, and you are like an
3100   Angell.
3101   <S {Kath}.> {Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?}
3102   <S {Lady}.> {Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il}.
3103  *<S {King}.> I said so, deare {Katherine}, and I must not blush
3104   to affirme it.
3105  *<S {Kath}.> {O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de}
3106   {tromperies}.
3107  *<S {King}.> What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of
3108   men are full of deceits?
3109  *<S {Lady}.> {Ouy}, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of de-ceits:
3110   dat is de Princesse.
3111  *<S {King}.> The Princesse is the better English- woman:
3112  *yfaith {Kate}, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
3113  *glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
3114  *could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
3115  *thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
3116  *Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but di-rectly
3117  *to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
3118  *then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
3119  *me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bar-gaine:
3120   how say you, Lady?
3121   <S {Kath}.> {Sauf vostre honeur}, me vnderstand well.
3122  *<S {King}.> Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
3123  *Dance for your sake, {Kate}, why you vndid me: for the one
3124  *I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
3125  *haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
3126  *strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape- frogge, or by
3127  *vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
3128  *vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
3129  *quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
3130  *Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
3131  *like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
3132  *before God {Kate}, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
3133  *my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
3134  *onely downe- right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
3135  *nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
3136  *of this temper, {Kate}, whose face is not worth Sunne- bur-ning?
3137  *that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
3138  *thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
3139  *to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
3140  *take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
3141  *for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
3142  *while thou liu'st, deare {Kate}, take a fellow of plaine and
3143  *vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
3144  *because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
3145  *these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
3146  *into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
3147  *out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
3148  *but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
3149  *stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
3150  *grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
3151  *hollow: but a good Heart, {Kate}, is the Sunne and the
3152  *Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
3153  *shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
3154  *truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
3155  *take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
3156  *And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
3157   and fairely, I pray thee.
3158  *<S {Kath}.> Is  it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
3159   Fraunce?
3160  *<S {King}.> No, it is not possible you should loue the Ene-mie
3161  *of France, {Kate}; but in louing me, you should loue
3162  *the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
3163  *will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
3164  *and {Kate}, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
3165   is France, and you are mine.
3166   <S {Kath}.> I cannot tell wat is dat.
3167  *<S {King}.> No, {Kate}? I will tell thee in French, which I am
3168  *sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new- married Wife
3169  *about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; {Ie}
3170  *{quand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le pos-session}
3171  *{de moy}. (Let mee see, what then? Saint {Dennis} bee
3172  *my speede) {Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne}.
3173  *It is as easie for me, {Kate}, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
3174  *speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
3175   French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me.
3176  *<S {Kath}.> {Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il}
3177   {& melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle}.
3178  *<S {King}.> No faith is't not, {Kate}: but thy speaking of
3179  *my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
3180  *needes be graunted to be much at one. But {Kate}, doo'st
3181  *thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
3182   mee?
3183   <S {Kath}.> I cannot tell.
3184  *<S {King}.> Can any of your Neighbours tell, {Kate}? Ile
3185  *aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
3186  *when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
3187  *Gentlewoman about me; and I know, {Kate}, you will to
3188  *her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
3189  *heart: but good {Kate}, mocke me mercifully, the rather
3190  *gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
3191  *beest mine, {Kate}, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
3192  *me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
3193  *must therefore needes proue a good Souldier- breeder:
3194  *Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint {Dennis} and Saint
3195  *{George}, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
      <P k1v>
3196  *that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
3197  *the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
3198   Flower- de- Luce.
3199   <S {Kate}.> I doe not know dat.
3200  *<S {King}.> No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
3201  *doe but now promise {Kate}, you will endeauour for your
3202  *French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
3203  *take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer
3204  *you. {La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher & deuin}
3205   {deesse}.
3206  *<S {Kath}.> Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to
3207   deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce.
3208  *<S {King}.> Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
3209  *in true English, I loue thee {Kate}; by which Honor, I dare
3210  *not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flat-ter
3211  *me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
3212  *vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
3213  *Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
3214  *when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stub-borne
3215  *out- side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
3216  *to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith {Kate}, the el-der
3217  *I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
3218  *Old Age, that #ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
3219  *spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
3220  *the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
3221  *better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire {Ka-therine},
3222  *will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
3223  *auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
3224  *an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, {Harry} of
3225  *England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
3226  *blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, Eng-land
3227  *is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and {Henry}
3228  *{Plantaginet} is thine; who, though I speake it before his
3229  *Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
3230  *finde the best King of Good- fellowes. Come your An-swer
3231  *in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
3232  *thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, {Katherine},
3233  *breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
3234   haue me?
3235   <S {Kath}.> Dat is as it shall please {de Roy mon pere}.
3236  *<S {King}.> Nay, it will please him well, {Kate}; it shall please
3237   him, {Kate}.
3238   <S {Kath}.> Den it sall also content me.
3239  *<S {King}.> Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my
3240   Queene.
3241  *<S {Kath}.> {Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne}
3242  *{veus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le}
3243  *{main d' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie}
3244   {vous supplie mon tres- puissant Seigneur}.
3245   <S {King}.> Then I will kisse your Lippes, {Kate}.
3246  *<S {Kath}.> {Les Dames & Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant}
3247   {leur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce}.
3248   <S {King}.> Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee?
3249  *<S {Lady}.> Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of
3250   Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish.
3251   <S {King}.> To kisse.
3252   <S {Lady}.> Your Maiestee {entendre bettre que moy}.
3253  *<S {King}.> It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to
3254   kisse before they are marryed, would she say?
3255   <S {Lady}.> {Ouy verayment}.
3256  *<S {King}.> O {Kate}, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
3257  *Deare {Kate}, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
3258  *weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the ma-kers
3259  *of Manners, {Kate}; and the libertie that followes
3260  *our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde- faults, as I
3261  *will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
3262  *Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
3263  *and yeelding. You haue Witch- craft in your Lippes,
3264  *{Kate}: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
3265  *them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
3266  *they should sooner perswade {Harry} of England, then a
3267  *generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
3268   Father.
3269   <D {Enter the French Power, and the English}
3270   {Lords}.>
3271  *<S {Burg}.> God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
3272   teach you our Princesse English?
3273  *<S {King}.> I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
3274   perfectly I loue her, and that is good English.
3275   <S {Burg}.> Is shee not apt?
3276  *<S {King}.> Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Conditi-on
3277  *is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
3278  *the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
3279  *the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
3280   likenesse.
3281  *<S {Burg}.> Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
3282  *you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
3283  *make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
3284  *likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
3285  *blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
3286  *Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
3287  *of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
3288  *(my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
3289   to.
3290  *<S {King}.> Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
3291   and enforces.
3292  *<S {Burg}.> They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
3293   not what they doe.
3294  *<S {King}.> Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to
3295   consent winking.
3296  *<S {Burg}.> I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
3297  *will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
3298  *Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholo-mew- tyde,
3299  *blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
3300  *they will endure handling, which before would not abide
3301   looking on.
3302  *<S {King}.> This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
3303  *Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
3304   the latter end, and she must be blinde #to.
3305   <S {Burg}.> As Loue is my Lord, before it loues.
3306  *<S {King}.> It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke
3307  *Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire
3308  *French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my
3309   way.
3310  *<S {French} {King}.> Yes my Lord, you see them perspec-tiuely:
3311  *the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
3312  *all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath en-tred.
3313  _
3314   <S {England}.> Shall {Kate} be my Wife?
3315   <S {France}.> So please you.
3316  *<S {England}.> I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
3317  *talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
3318  *the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
3319   #Will.
3320  *<S {France}.> Wee haue consented to all tearmes of rea-son.
3321  _
3322   <S {England}.> Is't so, my Lords of England?
3323   <S {West}.> The King hath graunted euery Article:
3324   His Daughter first; and in sequele, all,
3325   According to their firme proposed natures.
      <P k2>
3326   <S {Exet}.> Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:
3327  *Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France
3328  *hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall
3329  *name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this additi-on,

3331  *{Heretere de Fraunce}: and thus in Latine; {Praeclarissimus}
3332   {Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliae & Heres Franciae}.
3333   <S {France}.> Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd,
3334   But your request shall make me let it passe.
3335   <S {England}.> I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,
3336   Let that one Article ranke with the rest,
3337   And thereupon giue me your Daughter.
3338  *<S {France}.> Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp
3339   Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes
3340   Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,
3341   With enuy of each others happinesse,
3342   May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction
3343   Plant Neighbour- hood and Christian- like accord
3344   In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance
3345   His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France.
3346   <S {Lords}.> Amen.

3348   That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.
3349   <D {Flourish}.>

3351   Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:
3352   As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,
3353   So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,
3354   That neuer may #ill Office, or fell Iealousie,
3355   Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,
3356   Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,
3357   To make diuorce of their incorporate League:
3358   That English may as French, French Englishmen,
3359   Receiue each other. God speake this Amen.
3360   <S {All}.> Amen.
3361   <S {King}.> Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,
3362   My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath
3363   And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.
3364   Then shall I sweare to {Kate}, and you to me,
3365   And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be.
3366   <D {Senet. Exeunt}.>
3367   <D {Enter Chorus}.>
3368   Thus farre with rough, and all- vnable Pen,
3369   Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,
3370   In little roome confining mightie men,
3371   Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
3372   Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
3373   This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;
3374   By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
3375   And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.
3376   {Henry} the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
3377   Of France and England, did this King succeed:
3378   Whose State so many had the managing,
3379   That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
3380   Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
3381   In your faire minds let this acceptance take.
