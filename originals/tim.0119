2      <D {Enter Poet, Painter, Ieweller, Merchant, and Mercer},
3      {at seuerall doores}.>
4      <S {Poet}.>
5      Good day Sir.
6      <S {Pain}.> I am glad y'are well.
7     *<S {Poet}.> I haue not seene you long, how goes
8      the World?
9      <S {Pain}.> It weares sir, as it growes.
10     <S {Poet}.> #I that's well knowne:
11     But what particular Rarity? What strange,
12     Which manifold record not matches: see
13     Magicke of Bounty, all these spirits thy power
14     Hath coniur'd to attend.
15     I know the Merchant.
16     <S {Pain}.> I know them both: th' others a Ieweller.
17     <S {Mer}.> O 'tis a worthy Lord.
18     <S {Iew}.> Nay that's most fixt.
19    *<S {Mer}.> A most incomparable man, breath'd as it were,
20     To an vntyreable and continuate goodnesse:
21     He passes.
22     <S {Iew}.> I haue a Iewell heere.
23     <S {Mer}.> O pray let's see't. For the Lord {Timon}, sir?
24     <S {Iewel}.> If he will touch the estimate. But for that===
25    *<S {Poet}.> When we for recompence haue prais'd the vild,
26     It staines the glory in that happy Verse,
27     Which aptly sings the good.
28     <S {Mer}.> 'Tis a good forme.
29     <S {Iewel}.> And rich: heere is a Water looke ye.
30    *<S {Pain}.> You are rapt sir, in some worke, some Dedica-tion
31     to the great Lord.
32     <S {Poet}.> A thing slipt idlely from me.
33     Our Poesie is as a Gowne, which vses
34     From whence 'tis nourisht: the fire i'th' Flint
35     Shewes not, till it be strooke: our gentle flame
36     Prouokes it selfe, and like the currant flyes
37     Each bound it chases. What haue you there?
38     <S {Pain}.> A Picture sir: when comes your Booke forth?
39     <S {Poet}.> Vpon the heeles of my presentment sir.
40     Let's see your peece.
41     <S {Pain}.> 'Tis a good Peece.
42     <S {Poet}.> So 'tis, this comes off well, and excellent.
43     <S {Pain}.> Indifferent.
44     <S {Poet}.> Admirable: How this grace
45     Speakes his owne standing: what a mentall power
46     This eye shootes forth? How bigge imagination
47     Moues in this Lip, to th' dumbnesse of the gesture,
48     One might interpret.
49     <S {Pain}.> It is a pretty mocking of the life:
50     Heere is a touch: Is't good?
51     <S {Poet}.> I will say of it,
52     It Tutors Nature, Artificiall strife
53     Liues in these toutches, liuelier then life.
54     <D {Enter certaine Senators}.>
55     <S {Pain}.> How this Lord is followed.
56     <S {Poet}.> The Senators of Athens, happy men.
57     <S {Pain}.> Looke moe.
58    *<S {Po}.> You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors,
59     I haue in this rough worke, shap'd out a man
60     Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hugge
61     With amplest entertainment: My free drift
62     Halts not particularly, but moues it selfe
63     In a wide Sea of wax, no leuell'd malice
64     Infects one comma in the course I hold,
65     But flies an Eagle flight, bold, and forth on,
66     Leauing no Tract behinde.
67     <S {Pain}.> How shall I vnderstand you?
68     <S {Poet}.> I will vnboult to you.
69     You see how all Conditions, how all Mindes,
70     As well of glib and slipp'ry Creatures, as
71     Of Graue and austere qualitie, tender downe
72     Their seruices to Lord {Timon}: his large Fortune,
73     Vpon his good and gracious Nature hanging,
74     Subdues and properties to his loue and tendance
75     All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glasse- fac'd Flatterer
76     To {Apemantus}, that few things loues better
77     Then to abhorre himselfe; euen hee drops downe
78     The knee before him, and returnes in peace
79     Most rich in {Timons} nod.
80     <S {Pain}.> I saw them speake together.
81     <S {Poet}.> Sir, I haue vpon a high and pleasant hill
82     Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd.
83     The Base o'th' Mount
84     Is rank'd with all deserts, all kinde of Natures
85     That labour on the bosome of this Sphere,
86     To propagate their states; among'st them all,
87     Whose eyes are on this Soueraigne Lady fixt,
88     One do I personate of Lord {Timons} frame,
89     Whom Fortune with her Iuory hand wafts to her,
90     Whose present grace, to present slaues and seruants
91     Translates his Riuals.
92     <S {Pain}.> 'Tis conceyu'd, to scope
93     This Throne, this Fortune, and this Hill me thinkes
      <P Gg2>
94     With one man becken'd from the rest below,
95     Bowing his head against the sleepy Mount
96     To climbe his happinesse, would be well exprest
97     In our Condition.
98     <S {Poet}.> Nay Sir, but heare me on:
99     All those which were his Fellowes but of late,
100    Some better then his valew; on the moment
101    Follow his strides, his Lobbies fill with tendance,
102    Raine Sacrificiall whisperings in his eare,
103    Make Sacred euen his styrrop, and through him
104    Drinke the free Ayre.
105    <S {Pain}.> #I marry, what of these?
106   *<S {Poet}.> When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
107    Spurnes downe her late beloued; all his Dependants
108    Which labour'd after him to the Mountaines top,
109    Euen on their knees and hand, let him sit downe,
110    Not one accompanying his declining foot.
111    <S {Pain}.> Tis common:
112    A thousand morall Paintings I can shew,
113   *That shall demonstrate these quicke blowes of Fortunes,
114    More pregnantly then words. Yet you do well,
115    To shew Lord {Timon}, that meane eyes haue seene
116    The foot aboue the head.
117    <D {Trumpets sound}.>
118    <D {Enter Lord Timon, addressing himselfe curteously}
119    {to euery Sutor}.>
120    <S {Tim}.> Imprison'd is he, say you?
121    <S {Mes}.> #I my good Lord, fiue Talents is his debt,
122    His meanes most short, his Creditors most straite:
123    Your Honourable Letter he desires
124    To those haue shut him vp, which failing,
125    Periods his comfort.
126    <S {Tim}.> Noble {Ventidius}, well:
127    I am not of that Feather, to shake off
128    My Friend when he must neede me. I do know him
129    A Gentleman, that well deserues a helpe,
130    Which he shall haue. Ile pay the debt, and free him.
131    <S {Mes}.> Your Lordship euer bindes him.
132    <S {Tim}.> Commend me to him, I will send his ransome,
133    And being enfranchized bid him come to me;
134    'Tis not enough to helpe the Feeble vp,
135    But to support him after. Fare you well.
136    <S {Mes}.> All happinesse to your Honor.  <D {Exit}.>
137    <D {Enter an old Athenian}.>
138    <S {Oldm}.> Lord {Timon}, heare me speake.
139    <S {Tim}.> Freely good Father.
140    <S {Oldm}.> Thou hast a Seruant nam'd {Lucilius}.
141    <S {Tim}.> I haue so: What of him?
142    <S {Oldm}.> Most Noble {Timon}, call the man before thee.
143    <S {Tim}.> Attends he heere, or no? {Lucillius}.
144    <S {Luc}.> Heere at your Lordships seruice.
145   *<S {Oldm}.> This Fellow heere, L[ord]. {Timon}, this thy Creature,
146    By night frequents my house. I am a man
147    That from my first haue beene inclin'd to thrift,
148    And my estate deserues an Heyre more rais'd,
149    Then one which holds a Trencher.
150    <S {Tim}.> Well: what further?
151    <S {Old}.> One onely Daughter haue I, no Kin else,
152    On whom I may conferre what I haue got:
153    The Maid is faire, a'th' youngest for a Bride,
154    And I haue bred her at my deerest cost
155    In Qualities of the best. This man of thine
156    Attempts her loue: I prythee (Noble Lord)
157    Ioyne with me to forbid him her resort,
158    My selfe haue spoke in vaine.
159    <S {Tim}.> The man is honest.
160    <S {Oldm}.> Therefore he will be {Timon},
161    His honesty rewards him in it selfe,
162    It must not beare my Daughter.
163    <S {Tim}.> Does she loue him?
164    <S {Oldm}.> She is yong and apt:
165    Our owne precedent passions do instruct vs
166    What leuities in youth.
167    <S {Tim}.> Loue you the Maid?
168    <S {Luc}.> #I my good Lord, and she accepts of it.
169    <S {Oldm}.> If in her Marriage my consent be missing,
170    I call the Gods to witnesse, I will choose
171    Mine heyre from forth the Beggers of the world,
172    And dispossesse her all.
173    <S {Tim}.> How shall she be endowed,
174    If she be mated with an equall Husband?
175    <S {Oldm}.> Three Talents on the present; in future, all.
176    <S {Tim}.> This Gentleman of mine
177    Hath seru'd me long:
178    To build his Fortune, I will straine a little,
179    For 'tis a Bond in men. Giue him thy Daughter,
180    What you bestow, in him Ile counterpoize,
181    And make him weigh with her.
182    <S {Oldm}.> Most Noble Lord,
183    Pawne me to this your Honour, she is his.
184    <S {Tim}.> My hand to thee,
185    Mine Honour on my promise.
186    <S {Luc}.> Humbly I thanke your Lordship, neuer may
187    That state or Fortune fall into my keeping,
188    Which is not owed to you.  <D {Exit}>
189    <S {Poet}.> Vouchsafe my Labour,
190    And long liue your Lordship.
191    <S {Tim}.> I thanke you, you shall heare from me anon:
192    Go not away. What haue you there, my Friend?
193    <S {Pain}.> A peece of Painting, which I do beseech
194    Your Lordship to accept.
195    <S {Tim}.> Painting is welcome.
196    The Painting is almost the Naturall man:
197    For since Dishonor Traffickes with mans Nature,
198    He is but out- side: These Pensil'd Figures are
199    Euen such as they giue out. I like your worke,
200    And you shall finde I like it; Waite attendance
201    Till you heare further from me.
202    <S {Pain}.> The Gods preserue ye.
203   *<S {Tim}.> Well fare you Gentleman: giue me your hand.
204    We must needs dine together: sir your Iewell
205    Hath suffered vnder praise.
206    <S {Iewel}.> What my Lord, dispraise?
207    <S {Tim}.> A meere saciety of Commendations,
208    If I should pay you for't as 'tis extold,
209    It would vnclew me quite.
210    <S {Iewel}.> My Lord, 'tis rated
211    As those which sell would giue: but you well know,
212    Things of like valew differing in the Owners,
213    Are prized by their Masters. Beleeu't deere Lord,
214    You mend the Iewell by the wearing it.
215    <S {Tim}.> Well mock'd. <D {Enter Apermantus}.>
216   *<S {Mer}.> No my good Lord, he speakes y common toong
217    Which all men speake with him.
218    <S {Tim}.> Looke who comes heere, will you be chid?
219    <S {Iewel}.> Wee'l beare with your Lordship.
220    <S {Mer}.> Hee'l spare none.
221    <S {Tim}.> Good morrow to thee,
222    Gentle {Apermantus}.
      <P Gg2v>
223   *<S {Ape}.> Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow.
224    When thou art {Timons} dogge, and these Knaues honest.
225   *<S {Tim}.> Why dost thou call them Knaues, thou know'st
226    them not?
227    <S {Ape}.> Are they not Athenians?
228    <S {Tim}.> Yes.
229    <S {Ape}.> Then I repent not.
230    <S {Iew}.> You know me, {Apemantus}?
231    <S {Ape}.> Thou know'st I do, I call'd thee by thy name.
232    <S {Tim}.> Thou art proud {Apemantus}?
233   *<S {Ape}.> Of nothing so much, as that I am not like {Timon}
234    <S {Tim}.> Whether #art going?
235    <S {Ape}.> To knocke out an honest Athenians braines.
236    <S {Tim}.> That's a deed thou't dye for.
237    <S {Ape}.> Right, if doing nothing be death by th' Law.
238    <S {Tim}.> How lik'st thou this picture {Apemantus}?
239    <S {Ape}.> The best, for the innocence.
240    <S {Tim}.> Wrought he not well that painted it.
241   *<S {Ape}.> He wrought better that made the Painter, and
242    yet he's but a filthy peece of worke.
243    <S {Pain}.> Y'are a Dogge.
244   *<S {Ape}.> Thy Mothers of my generation: what's she, if I
245    be a Dogge?
246    <S {Tim}.> Wilt dine with me {Apemantus}?
247    <S {Ape}.> No: I eate not Lords.
248    <S {Tim}.> #And thou should'st, thoud'st anger Ladies.
249    <S {Ape}.> O they eate Lords;
250    So they come by great bellies.
251    <S {Tim}.> That's a lasciuious apprehension.
252    <S {Ape}.> So, thou apprehend'st it,
253    Take it for thy labour.
254    <S {Tim}.> How dost thou like this Iewell, {Apemantus}?
255   *<S {Ape}.> Not so well as plain- dealing, which wil not cast
256    a man a Doit.
257    <S {Tim}.> What dost thou thinke 'tis worth?
258    <S {Ape}.> Not worth my thinking.
259    How now Poet?
260    <S {Poet}.> How now Philosopher?
261    <S {Ape}.> Thou lyest.
262    <S {Poet}.> Art not one?
263    <S {Ape}.> Yes.
264    <S {Poet}.> Then I lye not.
265    <S {Ape}.> Art not a Poet?
266    <S {Poet}.> Yes.
267    <S {Ape}.> Then thou lyest:
268   *Looke in thy last worke, where thou hast feign'd him a
269    worthy Fellow.
270    <S {Poet}.> That's not feign'd, he is so.
271   *<S {Ape}.> Yes he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
272   *labour. He that loues to be flattered, is worthy o'th flat-terer.
273    Heauens, that I were a Lord.
274    <S {Tim}.> What wouldst do then {Apemantus}?
275   *<S {Ape}.> E'ne as {Apemantus} does now, hate a Lord with
276    my heart.
277    <S {Tim}.> What thy selfe?
278    <S {Ape}.> #I.
279    <S {Tim}.> Wherefore?
280    <S {Ape}.> That I had no angry wit to be a Lord.
281    Art not thou a Merchant?
282    <S {Mer}.> #I {Apemantus}.
283    <S {Ape}.> Traffick confound thee, if the Gods will not.
284    <S {Mer}.> If Trafficke do it, the Gods do it.
285    <S {Ape}.> Traffickes thy God, & thy God confound thee.
286    <D {Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger}.>
287    <S {Tim}.> What Trumpets that?
288    <S {Mes}.> 'Tis {Alcibiades}, and some twenty Horse
289    All of Companionship.
290    <S {Tim}.> Pray entertaine them, giue them guide to vs.
291    You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
292    Till I haue thankt you: when dinners done
293    Shew me this peece, I am ioyfull of your sights.
294    <D {Enter Alcibiades with the rest}.>
295    Most welcome Sir.
296   *<S {Ape}.> So, so; their Aches contract, and sterue your
297   *supple ioynts: that there should bee small loue amongest
298   *these sweet Knaues, and all this Curtesie. The straine of
299    mans bred out into Baboon and Monkey.
300    <S {Alc}.> Sir, you haue sau'd my longing, and I feed
301    Most hungerly on your sight.
302    <S {Tim}.> Right welcome Sir:
303    Ere we depart, wee'l share a bounteous time
304    In different pleasures.
305    Pray you let vs in.  <D {Exeunt}.>
306    <D {Enter two Lords}.>
307    <S 1.{Lord}> What time #a day is't {Apemantus}?
308    <S {Ape}.> Time to be honest.
309    <S 1> That time serues still.
310    <S {Ape}.> The most accursed thou that still omitst it.
311    <S 2> Thou art going to Lord {Timons} Feast.
312   *<S {Ape}.> #I, to see meate fill Knaues, and Wine heat fooles.
313    <S 2> Farthee well, farthee well.
314    <S {Ape}.> Thou art a Foole to bid me farewell twice.
315    <S 2> Why {Apemantus}?
316   *<S {Ape}.> Should'st haue kept one to thy selfe, for I meane
317    to giue thee none.
318    <S 1> Hang thy selfe.
319    <S {Ape}.> No I will do nothing at thy bidding:
320    Make thy requests to thy Friend.
321    <S 2> Away vnpeaceable Dogge,
322    Or Ile spurne thee hence.
323    <S {Ape}.> I will flye like a dogge, the heeles a'th' Asse.
324    <S 1> Hee's opposite to humanity.
325    Come shall we in,
326    And taste Lord {Timons} bountie: he out- goes
327    The verie heart of kindnesse.
328    <S 2> He powres it out: {Plutus} the God of Gold
329    Is but his Steward: no meede but he repayes
330    Seuen- fold aboue it selfe: No guift to him,
331    But breeds the giuer a returne: exceeding
332    All vse of quittance.
333    <S 1> The Noblest minde he carries,
334    That euer gouern'd man.
335    <S 2> Long may he liue in Fortunes. Shall we in?
336    Ile keepe you Company.  <D {Exeunt}.>

340   *{from prison. Then comes dropping after all Ape-mantus}
341    {discontentedly like himselfe}.>
342    <S {Ventig}.> Most honoured {Timon},
343    It hath pleas'd the Gods to remember my Fathers age,
344    And call him to long peace:
345    He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
346    Then, as in gratefull Vertue I am bound
347    To your free heart, I do returne those Talents
348    Doubled with thankes and seruice, from whose helpe
349    I deriu'd libertie.
350    <S {Tim}.> O by no meanes,
351    Honest {Ventigius}: You mistake my loue,
      <P Gg3>
352    I gaue it freely euer, and ther's none
353    Can truely say he giues, if he receiues:
354    If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
355    To imitate them: faults that are rich are faire.
356    <S {Vint}.> A Noble spirit.
357   *<S {Tim}.> Nay my Lords, Ceremony was but deuis'd at first
358    To set a glosse on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
359    Recanting goodnesse, sorry ere 'tis showne:
360    But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
361    Pray sit, more welcome are ye to my Fortunes,
362    Then my Fortunes to me.
363    <S 1.{Lord}.> My Lord, we alwaies haue confest it.
364   *<S {Aper}.> Ho ho, confest it? Handg'd it? Haue you not?
365    <S {Timo}.> O {Apermantus}, you are welcome.
366    <S {Aper}.> No: You shall not make me welcome:
367    I come to haue thee thrust me out of doores.
368   *<S {Tim}.> Fie, th'art a churle, ye'haue got a humour there
369    Does not become a man, 'tis much #too blame:
370    They say my Lords, {Ira furor breuis est},
371    But yond man is verie angrie.
372    Go, let him haue a Table by himselfe:
373    For he does neither affect companie,
374    Nor is he fit for't indeed.
375    <S {Aper}.> Let me stay at thine apperill {Timon},
376    I come to obserue, I giue thee warning on't.
377   *<S {Tim}.> I take no heede of thee: Th'art an {Athenian},
378   *therefore welcome: I my selfe would haue no power,
379    prythee let my meate make thee silent.
380   *<S {Aper}.> I scorne thy meate, 'twould choake me: for I
381   *should nere flatter thee. Oh you Gods! What a number
382   *of men eats {Timon}, and he sees 'em not? It greeues me
383   *to see so many dip #there meate in one mans blood, and
384    all the madnesse is, he cheeres them vp too.
385    I wonder men dare trust themselues with men.
386    Me thinks they should enuite them without kniues,
387    Good for #there meate, and safer for their liues.
388   *There's much example for't, the fellow that sits next him,
389   *now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in
390   *a diuided draught: is the readiest man to kill him. 'Tas
391   *beene proued, if I were a huge man I should feare to
392   *drinke at meales, least they should spie my wind- pipes
393   *dangerous noates, great men should drinke with harnesse
394    on their throates.
395   *<S {Tim}.> My Lord in heart: and let the health go round.
396    <S 2.{Lord}.> Let it flow this way my good Lord.
397   *<S {Aper}.> Flow this way? A braue fellow. He keepes his
398   *tides well, those healths will make thee and thy state
399    looke #ill, {Timon}.
400    Heere's that which is too weake to be a sinner,
401    Honest water, which nere left man i'th' mire:
402    This and my food are equals, there's no ods,
403    Feasts are #to proud to giue thanks to the Gods.
404    <D {Apermantus Grace}.>
405    {Immortall Gods, I craue no pelfe},
406    {I pray for no man but my selfe},
407    {Graunt I may neuer proue so fond},
408    {To trust man on his Oath or Bond}.
409    {Or a Harlot for her weeping},
410    {Or a Dogge that seemes asleeping},
411    {Or a keeper with my freedome},
412    {Or my friends if I should need 'em}.
413    {Amen. So fall too't:}
414    {Richmen sin, and I eat root}.
415    Much good dich thy good heart, {Apermantus}
416    <S {Tim}.> Captaine,
417    {Alcibiades}, your hearts in the field now.
418    <S {Alci}.> My heart is euer at your seruice, my Lord.
419   *<S {Tim}.> You had rather be at a breakefast of Enemies,
420    then a dinner of Friends.
421   *<S {Alc}.> So they were bleeding new my Lord, there's no
422   *meat like 'em, I could wish my best friend at such a Feast.
423   *<S {Aper}.> Would all those Flatterers were thine Enemies
424   *then, that then thou might'st kill 'em: & bid me to 'em.
425   *<S 1.{Lord}.> Might we but haue that happinesse my Lord,
426   *that you would once vse our hearts, whereby we might
427   *expresse some part of our zeales, we should thinke our
428    selues for euer perfect.
429   *<S {Timon}.> Oh no doubt my good Friends, but the Gods
430   *themselues haue prouided that I shall haue much helpe
431   *from you: how had you beene my Friends else. Why
432   *haue you that charitable title from thousands? Did not
433   *you chiefely belong to my heart? I haue told more of
434   *you to my selfe, then you can with modestie speake in
435   *your owne behalfe. And thus farre I confirme you. Oh
436   *you Gods (thinke I,) what need we haue any Friends; if
437   *we should nere haue need of 'em? They were the most
438   *needlesse Creatures liuing; should we nere haue vse for
439   *'em? And would most resemble sweete Instruments
440   *hung vp in Cases, that keepes #there sounds to them-selues.
441   *Why I haue often wisht my selfe poorer, that
442   *I might come neerer to you: we are borne to do bene-fits.
443   *And what better or properer can we call our owne,
444   *then the riches of our Friends? Oh what a pretious com-fort
445   *'tis, to haue so many like Brothers commanding
446   *one anothers Fortunes. Oh ioyes, e'ne made away er't
447   *can be borne: mine eies cannot hold out water me thinks
448    to forget their Faults. I drinke to you.
449    <S {Aper}.> Thou weep'st to make them drinke, {Timon}.
450    <S 2.{Lord}.> Ioy had the like conception in our eies,
451    And at that instant, like a babe sprung vp.
452   *<S {Aper}.> Ho, ho: I laugh to thinke that babe a bastard.
453   *<S 3.{Lord}.> I promise you my Lord you mou'd me much.
454    <S {Aper}.> Much.
455    <D {Sound Tucket. Enter the Maskers of Amazons, with}
456    {Lutes in their hands, dauncing and playing}.>
457    <S {Tim}.> What meanes that Trumpe? How now?
458    <D {Enter Seruant}.>
459    <S {Ser}.> Please you my Lord, there are certaine Ladies
460    Most desirous of admittance.
461    <S {Tim}.> Ladies? what are their wils?
462   *<S {Ser}.> There comes with them a fore- runner my Lord,
463    which beares that office, to signifie their pleasures.
464    <S {Tim}.> I pray let them be admitted.
465    <D {Enter Cupid with the Maske of Ladies}.>
466   *<S {Cup}.> Haile to thee worthy {Timon} and to all that of
467   *his Bounties taste: the fiue best Sences acknowledge thee
468   *their Patron, and come freely to gratulate thy plentious
469    bosome.
470    There tast, touch all, pleas'd from thy Table rise:
471    They onely now come but to Feast thine eies.
472   *<S {Timo}.> #They'r welcome all, let 'em haue kind admit-tance.
473    Musicke make their welcome.
474    <S {Luc}.> You see my Lord, how ample y'are belou'd.
475    <S {Aper}.> Hoyday,
476    What a sweepe of vanitie comes this way.
477    They daunce? They are madwomen,
      <P Gg3v><C E>
478    Like Madnesse is the glory of this life,
479    As this pompe shewes to a little oyle and roote.
480    We make our selues Fooles, to disport our selues,
481    And spend our Flatteries, to drinke those men,
482    Vpon whose Age we voyde it vp agen
483    With poysonous Spight and Enuy.
484    Who liues, that's not depraued, or depraues;
485    Who dyes, that beares not one spurne to their graues
486    Of their Friends guift:
487    I should feare, those that dance before me now,
488    Would one day stampe vpon me: 'Tas bene done,
489    Men shut their doores against a setting Sunne.
490   *<D {The Lords rise from Table, with much adoring of Timon, and}

492   *{Dance, men with women, a loftie straine or two to the}
493    {Hoboyes, and cease}.>
494    <S {Tim}.> You haue done our pleasures
495    Much grace (faire Ladies)
496    Set a faire fashion on our entertainment,
497    Which was not halfe so beautifull, and kinde:
498    You haue added worth vntoo't, and luster,
499    And entertain'd me with mine owne deuice.
500    I am to thanke you for't.
501    <S 1 {Lord}.> My Lord you take vs euen at the best.
502   *<S {Aper}.> Faith for the worst is filthy, and would not hold
503    taking, I doubt me.
504    <S {Tim}.> Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you,
505    Please you to dispose your selues.
506    <S {All} {La}.> Most thankfully, my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}.>
507    <S {Tim}.> {Flauius}.
508    <S {Fla}.> My Lord.
509    <S {Tim}.> The little Casket bring me hither.
510    <S {Fla}.> Yes, my Lord. More Iewels yet?
511    There is no crossing him in's humor,
512    Else I should tell him well, yfaith I should;
513    When all's spent, hee'ld be crost then, #and he could:
514    'Tis pitty Bounty had not eyes behinde,
515    That man might ne're be wretched for his minde.  <D {Exit}.>
516    <S 1 {Lord}.> Where be our men?
517    <S {Ser}.> Heere my Lord, in readinesse.
518    <S 2 {Lord}.> Our Horses.
519    <S {Tim}.> O my Friends:
520   *I haue one word to say to you: Looke you, my good L[ord].
521    I must intreat you honour me so much,
522    As to aduance this Iewell, accept it, and weare it,
523    Kinde my Lord.
524    <S 1 {Lord}.> I am so farre already in your guifts.
525    <S {All}.> So are we all.
526    <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
527   *<S {Ser}.> My Lord, there are certaine Nobles of the Senate
528    newly alighted, and come to visit you.
529    <S {Tim}.> They are fairely welcome.
530    <D {Enter Flauius}.>
531   *<S {Fla}.> I beseech your Honor, vouchsafe me a word, it
532    does concerne you neere.
533    <S {Tim}.> Neere? why then another time Ile heare thee.
534   *I prythee let's be prouided to shew them entertainment.
535    <S {Fla}.> I scarse know how.
536    <D {Enter another Seruant}.>
537    <S {Ser}.> May it please your Honor, Lord {Lucius}
538    (Out of his free loue) hath presented to you
539    Foure Milke- white Horses, trapt in Siluer.
540    <S {Tim}.> I shall accept them fairely: let the Presents
541    Be worthily entertain'd.
542    <D {Enter a third Seruant}.>
543    How now? What newes?
544   *<S 3.{Ser}.> Please you my Lord, that honourable Gentle-man
545   *Lord {Lucullus}, entreats your companie to morrow,
546   *to hunt with him, and ha's sent your Honour two brace
547    of Grey- hounds.
548    <S {Tim}.> Ile hunt with him,
549    And let them be receiu'd, not without faire Reward.
550    <S {Fla}.> What will this come to?
551   *He commands vs to prouide, and giue great guifts, and
552    all out of an empty Coffer:
553    Nor will he know his Purse, or yeeld me this,
554    To shew him what a Begger his heart is,
555    Being of no power to make his wishes good.
556    His promises flye so beyond his state,
557   *That what he speaks is all in debt, he ows for eu'ry word:
558    He is so kinde, that he now payes interest for't;
559    His Land's put to their Bookes. Well, would I were
560    Gently put out of Office, before I were forc'd out:
561    Happier is he that has no friend to feede,
562    Then such that do e'ne Enemies exceede.
563    I bleed inwardly for my Lord.  <D {Exit}>
564    <S {Tim}.> You do your selues much wrong,
565    You bate too much of your owne merits.
566    Heere my Lord, a trifle of our Loue.
567    <S 2.{Lord}.> With more then common thankes
568    I will receyue it.
569    <S 3.{Lord}.> O he's the very soule of Bounty.
570   *<S {Tim}.> And now I remember my Lord, you gaue good
571   *words the other day of a Bay Courser I rod on. Tis yours
572    because you lik'd it.
573   *<S 1.{L}.> Oh, I beseech you pardon mee, my Lord, in that.
574   *<S {Tim}.> You may take my word my Lord: I know no
575   *man can iustly praise, but what he does affect. I weighe
576   *my Friends affection with mine owne: Ile tell you true,
577    Ile call to you.
578    <S {All} {Lor}.> O none so welcome.
579    <S {Tim}.> I take all, and your seuerall visitations
580    So kinde to heart, 'tis not enough to giue:
581    Me thinkes, I could deale Kingdomes to my Friends,
582    And nere be wearie. {Alcibiades},
583    Thou art a Soldiour, therefore sildome rich,
584    It comes in Charitie to thee: for all thy liuing
585    Is mong'st the dead: and all the Lands thou hast
586    Lye in a pitcht field.
587    <S {Alc}.> #I, defil'd Land, my Lord.
588    <S 1.{Lord}.> We are so vertuously bound.
589    <S {Tim}.> And so am I to you.
590    <S 2.{Lord}.> So infinitely endeer'd.
591    <S {Tim}.> All to you. Lights, more Lights.
592    <S 1.{Lord}.> The best of Happines, Honor, and Fortunes
593    Keepe with you Lord {Timon}.
594    <S {Tim}.> Ready for his Friends.  <D {Exeunt Lords}>
595   *<S {Aper}.> What a coiles heere, seruing of beckes, and iut-ting
596   *out of bummes. I doubt whether their Legges be
597    worth the summes that are giuen for 'em.
598    Friendships full of dregges,
599   *Me thinkes false hearts, should neuer haue sound legges.
600    Thus honest Fooles lay out their wealth on Curtsies.
601    <S {Tim}.> Now {Apermantus} (if thou wert not sullen)
602    I would be good to thee.
603   *<S {Aper}.> No, Ile nothing; for if I should be brib'd too,
604   *there would be none left to raile vpon thee, and then thou
605   *wouldst sinne the faster. Thou giu'st so long {Timon} (I
606   *feare me) thou wilt giue away thy selfe in paper shortly.
607    What needs these Feasts, pompes, and Vaine- glories?
      <P Gg4><C B>
608   *<S {Tim}.> Nay, #and you begin to raile on Societie once, I
609   *am sworne not to giue regard to you. Farewell, & come
610    with better Musicke.  <D {Exit}>
611   *<S {Aper}.> So: Thou wilt not heare mee now, thou shalt
612    not then. Ile locke thy heauen from thee:
613    Oh that mens eares should be
614    To Counsell deafe, but not to Flatterie.  <D {Exit}>
      <A S>
615    <D {Enter a Senator}.>
616    <S {Sen}.> And late fiue thousand: to {Varro} and to {Isidore}
617    He owes nine thousand, besides my former summe,
618    Which makes it fiue and twenty. Still in motion
619    Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not.
620    If I want Gold, steale but a beggers Dogge,
621    And giue it {Timon}, why the Dogge coines Gold.
622    If I would sell my Horse, and buy twenty moe
623    Better then he; why giue my Horse to {Timon}.
624    Aske nothing, giue it him, it Foles me straight
625    And able Horses: No Porter at his gate,
626    But rather one that smiles, and still inuites
627    All that passe by. It cannot hold, no reason
628    Can sound his state in safety. {Caphis} hoa,
629    {Caphis} I say.
630    <D {Enter Caphis}.>
631    <S {Ca}.> Heere sir, what is your pleasure.
632   *<S {Sen}.> Get on your cloake, & #hast you to Lord {Timon},
633    Importune him for my Moneyes, be not ceast
634    With slight deniall; nor then silenc'd, when
635    Commend me to your Master, and the Cap
636    Playes in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
637    My Vses cry to me; I must serue my turne
638    Out of mine owne, his dayes and times are past,
639    And my reliances on his fracted dates
640    Haue smit my credit. I loue, and honour him,
641    But must not breake my backe, to heale his finger.
642    Immediate are my needs, and my releefe
643    Must not be tost and turn'd to me in words,
644    But finde supply immediate. Get you gone,
645    Put on a most importunate aspect,
646    A visage of demand: for I do feare
647    When euery Feather stickes in his owne wing,
648    Lord {Timon} will be left a naked gull,
649    Which flashes now a Phoenix, get you gone.
650    <S {Ca}.> I go sir.
651    <S {Sen}.> I go sir?
652    Take the Bonds along with you,
653    And haue the dates in. Come.
654    <S {Ca}.> I will Sir.
655    <S {Sen}.> Go.  <D {Exeunt}>
656    <D {Enter Steward, with many billes in his hand}.>
657    <S {Stew}.> No care, no stop, so senselesse of expence,
658    That he will neither know how to maintaine it,
659    Nor cease his flow of Riot. Takes no accompt
660    How things go from him, nor resume no care
661    Of what is to continue: neuer minde,
662    Was to be so vnwise, to be so kinde.
663    What shall be done, he will not heare, till feele:
664    I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
665    Fye, fie, fie, fie.
666    <D {Enter Caphis, Isidore, and Varro}.>
667   *<S {Cap}.> Good euen {Varro}: what, you come for money?
668    <S {Var}.> Is't not your businesse too?
669    <S {Cap}.> It is, and yours too, {Isidore}?
670    <S {Isid}.> It is so.
671    <S {Cap}.> Would we were all discharg'd.
672    <S {Var}.> I feare it,
673    <S {Cap}.> Heere comes the Lord.
674    <D {Enter Timon, and his Traine}.>
675    <S {Tim}.> So soone as dinners done, wee'l forth againe
676    My {Alcibiades}. With me, what is your #will?
677    <S {Cap}.> My Lord, heere is a note of certaine dues.
678    <S {Tim}.> Dues? whence are you?
679    <S {Cap}.> Of Athens heere, my Lord.
680    <S {Tim}.> Go to my Steward.
681    <S {Cap}.> Please it your Lordship, he hath put me off
682    To the succession of new dayes this moneth:
683    My Master is awak'd by great Occasion,
684    To call vpon his owne, and humbly prayes you,
685    That with your other Noble parts, you'l suite,
686    In giuing him his right.
687    <S {Tim}.> Mine honest Friend,
688    I prythee but repaire to me next morning.
689    <S {Cap}.> Nay, good my Lord.
690    <S {Tim}.> Containe thy selfe, good Friend.
691    <S {Var}.> One {Varroes} seruant, my good Lord.
692   *<S {Isid}.> From {Isidore}, he humbly prayes your speedy pay-ment.
693   _
694    <S {Cap}.> If you did know my Lord, my Masters wants.
695   *<S {Var}.> 'Twas due on forfeyture my Lord, sixe weekes,
696    and past.
697    <S {Isi}.> Your Steward puts me off my Lord, and I
698    Am sent expressely to your Lordship.
699    <S {Tim}.> Giue me breath:
700    I do beseech you good my Lords keepe on,
701    Ile waite vpon you instantly. Come hither: pray you
702    How goes the world, that I am thus encountred
703    With clamorous demands of debt, broken Bonds,
704    And the detention of long since due debts
705    Against my Honor?
706    <S {Stew}.> Please you Gentlemen,
707    The time is vnagreeable to this businesse:
708    Your importunacie cease, till after dinner,
709    That I may make his Lordship vnderstand
710    Wherefore you are not paid.
711    <S {Tim}.> Do so my Friends, see them well entertain'd.
712    <S {Stew}.> Pray draw neere.  <D {Exit}.>
713    <D {Enter Apemantus and Foole}.>
714   *<S {Caph}.> Stay, stay, here comes the Foole with {Apeman-tus},
715    let's #ha some sport with 'em.
716    <S {Var}.> Hang him, hee'l abuse vs.
717    <S {Isid}.> A plague vpon him dogge.
718    <S {Var}.> How dost Foole?
719    <S {Ape}.> Dost Dialogue with thy shadow?
720    <S {Var}.> I speake not to thee.
721    <S {Ape}.> No 'tis to thy selfe. Come away.
722    <S {Isi}.> There's the Foole hangs on your backe already.
723    <S {Ape}.> No thou stand'st single, th'art not on him yet.
724    <S {Cap}.> Where's the Foole now?
725   *<S {Ape}.> He last ask'd the question. Poore Rogues, and
726    Vsurers men, Bauds betweene Gold and want.
727    <S {Al}.> What are we {Apemantus}?
728    <S {Ape}.> Asses.
729    <S {All}.> Why?
730   *<S {Ape}.> That you ask me what you are, & do not know
731    your selues. Speake to 'em Foole.

735   *<S {Foole}.> She's e'ne setting on water to scal'd such Chic-kens
736    as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth.
737    <S {Ape}.> Good, Gramercy.
738    <D {Enter Page}.>
739    <S {Foole}.> Looke you, heere comes my Masters Page.
740   *<S {Page}.> Why how now Captaine? what do you in this
741    wise Company.
742    How dost thou {Apermantus}?
743   *<S {Ape}.> Would I had a Rod in my mouth, that I might
744    answer thee profitably.
745   *<S {Boy}.> Prythee {Apemantus} reade me the superscripti-on
746    of these Letters, I know not which is which.
747    <S {Ape}.> Canst not read?
748    <S {Page}.> No.
749   *<S {Ape}.> There will litle Learning dye then that day thou
750   *art hang'd. This is to Lord {Timon}, this to {Alcibiades}. Go
751    thou was't borne a Bastard, and thou't dye a Bawd.
752   *<S {Page}.> Thou was't whelpt a Dogge, and thou shalt
753    famish a Dogges death.
754    Answer not, I am gone.  <D {Exit}>
755    <S {Ape}.> E'ne so thou out- runst Grace,
756    Foole I will go with you to Lord {Timons}.
757    <S {Foole}.> Will you leaue me there?
758    <S {Ape}.> If {Timon} stay at home.
759    You three serue three Vsurers?
760    <S {All}.> #I would they seru'd vs.
761    <S {Ape}.> So would I:
762    As good a tricke as euer Hangman seru'd Theefe.
763    <S {Foole}.> Are you three Vsurers men?
764    <S {All}.> #I Foole.
765   *<S {Foole}.> I thinke no Vsurer, but ha's a Foole to his Ser-uant.
766   *My Mistris is one, and I am her Foole: when men
767   *come to borrow of your Masters, they approach sadly,
768   *and go away merry: but they enter my Masters house
769    merrily, and go away sadly. The reason of this?
770    <S {Var}.> I could render one.
771   *<S {Ap}.> Do it then, that we may account thee a Whore-master,
772   *and a Knaue, which notwithstanding thou shalt
773    be no lesse esteemed.
774    <S {Varro}.> What is a Whoremaster Foole?
775   *<S {Foole}.> A Foole in good cloathes, and something like
776   *thee. 'Tis a spirit, sometime t' appeares like a Lord, som-time
777   *like a Lawyer, sometime like a Philosopher, with
778   *two stones moe then's artificiall one. Hee is verie often
779   *like a Knight; and generally, in all shapes that man goes
780   *vp and downe in, from fourescore to thirteen, this spirit
781    walkes in.
782    <S {Var}.> Thou art not altogether a Foole.
783    <S {Foole}.> Nor thou altogether a Wise man,
784    As much foolerie as I haue, so much wit thou lack'st.
785    <S {Ape}.> That answer might haue become {Apemantus}.
786    <S {All}.> Aside, aside, heere comes Lord {Timon}.
787    <D {Enter Timon and Steward}.>
788    <S {Ape}.> Come with me (Foole) come.
789   *<S {Foole}.> I do not alwayes follow Louer, elder Brother,
790    and Woman, sometime the Philosopher.
791    <S {Stew}.> Pray you walke neere,
792    Ile speake with you anon.  <D {Exeunt}.>
793    <S {Tim}.> You make me meruell wherefore ere this time
794    Had you not fully laide my state before me,
795    That I might so haue rated my expence
796    As I had leaue of meanes.
797    <S {Stew}.> You would not heare me:
798    At many leysures I propose.
799    <S {Tim}.> Go #too:
800    Perchance some single vantages you tooke,
801    When my indisposition put you backe,
802    And that vnaptnesse made your minister
803    Thus to excuse your selfe.
804    <S {Stew}.> O my good Lord,
805    At many times I brought in my accompts,
806    Laid them before you, you would throw them off,
807    And say you sound them in mine honestie,
808    When for some trifling present you haue bid me
809    Returne so much, I haue shooke my head, and wept:
810    Yea 'gainst th' Authoritie of manners, pray'd you
811    To hold your hand more close: I did indure
812    Not sildome, nor no slight checkes, when I haue
813    Prompted you in the ebbe of your estate,
814    And your great flow of debts; my lou'd Lord,
815    Though you heare now (too late) yet nowes a time,
816    The greatest of your #hauing, lackes a halfe,
817    To pay your present debts.
818    <S {Tim}.> Let all my Land be sold.
819    <S {Stew}.> 'Tis all engag'd, some forfeyted and gone,
820    And what remaines will hardly stop the mouth
821    Of present dues; the future comes apace:
822    What shall defend the interim, and at length
823    How goes our reck'ning?
824    <S {Tim}.> To Lacedemon did my Land extend.
825    <S {Stew}.> O my good Lord, the world is but a word,
826    Were it all yours, to giue it in a breath,
827    How quickely were it gone.
828    <S {Tim}.> You tell me true.
829    <S {Stew}.> If you suspect my Husbandry or Falshood,
830    Call me before th' exactest Auditors,
831    And set me on the proofe. So the Gods blesse me,
832    When all our Offices haue beene opprest
833    With riotous Feeders, when our Vaults haue wept
834    With drunken spilth of Wine; when euery roome
835    Hath blaz'd with Lights, and braid with Minstrelsie,
836    I haue retyr'd me to a wastefull cocke,
837    And set mine eyes at flow.
838    <S {Tim}.> Prythee no more.
839    <S {Stew}.> Heauens, haue I said, the bounty of this Lord:
840    How many prodigall bits haue Slaues and Pezants
841    This night englutted: who is not {Timons},
842   *What heart, head, sword, force, meanes, but is L[ord]. {Timons}:
843    Great {Timon}, Noble, Worthy, Royall {Timon}:
844    Ah, when the meanes are gone, that buy this praise,
845    The breath is gone, whereof this praise is made:
846    Feast won, fast lost; one cloud of Winter showres,
847    These flyes are coucht.
848    <S {Tim}.> Come sermon me no further.
849    No villanous bounty yet hath past my heart;
850    Vnwisely, not ignobly haue I giuen.
851    Why dost thou weepe, canst thou the conscience lacke,
852    To thinke I shall lacke friends: secure thy heart,
853    If I would broach the vessels of my loue,
854    And try the argument of hearts, by borrowing,
855    Men, and mens fortunes could I frankely vse
856    As I can bid thee speake.
      <A A>
857    <S {Ste}.> Assurance blesse your thoughts.
858   *<S {Tim}.> And in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd,
859    That I account them blessings. For by these
860    Shall I trie Friends. You shall perceiue
861    How you mistake my Fortunes:
862    I am wealthie in my Friends.
863    Within there, {Flauius}, {Seruilius}?
      <P Gg5>
864    <D {Enter three Seruants}.>
865    <S {Ser}.> My Lord, my Lord.
866    <S {Tim}.> I will dispatch you seuerally.
867   *You to Lord {Lucius}, to Lord {Lucullus} you, I hunted
868   *with his Honor to day; you to {Sempronius}; commend me
869   *to their loues; and I am proud say, that my occasions
870   *haue found time to vse 'em toward a supply of mony: let
871    the request be fifty Talents.
872    <S {Flam}.> As you haue said, my Lord.
873    <S {Stew}.> Lord {Lucius} and {Lucullus}? Humh.
874    <S {Tim}.> Go you sir to the Senators;
875    Of whom, euen to the States best health; I haue
876    Deseru'd this Hearing: bid 'em send o'th' instant
877    A thousand Talents to me.
878    <S {Ste}.> I haue beene bold
879    (For that I knew it the most generall way)
880    To them, to vse your Signet, and your Name,
881    But they do shake their heads, and I am heere
882    No richer in returne.
883    <S {Tim}.> Is't true? Can't be?
884    <S {Stew}.> They answer in a ioynt and corporate voice,
885    That now they are at fall, want Treasure cannot
886    Do what they would, are sorrie: you are Honourable,
887    But yet they could haue wisht, they know not,
888    Something hath beene amisse; a Noble Nature
889    May catch a wrench; would all were well; tis pitty,
890    And so intending other serious matters,
891    After distastefull lookes; and these hard Fractions
892    With certaine halfe- caps, and cold mouing nods,
893    They froze me into Silence.
894    <S {Tim}.> You Gods reward them:
895    Prythee man looke cheerely. These old Fellowes
896    Haue their ingratitude in them Hereditary:
897    Their blood is cak'd, 'tis cold, it sildome flowes,
898    'Tis lacke of kindely warmth, they are not kinde;
899    And Nature, as it growes againe toward earth,
900    Is fashion'd for the iourney, dull and heauy.
901    Go to {Ventiddius} (prythee be not sad,
902    Thou art true, and honest; Ingeniously I speake,
903    No blame belongs to thee:) {Ventiddius} lately
904    Buried his Father, by whose death hee's stepp'd
905    Into a great estate: When he was poore,
906    Imprison'd, and in scarsitie of Friends,
907    I cleer'd him with fiue Talents: Greet him from me,
908    Bid him suppose, some good necessity
909    Touches his Friend, which craues to be remembred
910   *With those fiue Talents; that had, giue't these Fellowes
911    To whom 'tis instant due. Neu'r speake, or thinke,
912    That {Timons} fortunes 'mong his Friends can sinke.
913    <S {Stew}.> I would I could not thinke it:
914    That thought is Bounties Foe;
915    Being free it selfe, it thinkes all others so. <D {Exeunt}>
      <A M>
916    <D {Flaminius waiting to speake with a Lord from his Master},
917    {enters a seruant to him}.>
918   *<S {Ser}.> I haue told my Lord of you, he is comming down
919    to you.
920    <S {Flam}.> I thanke you Sir.
921    <D {Enter Lucullus}.>
922    <S {Ser}.> Heere's my Lord.
923   *<S {Luc}.> One of Lord {Timons} men? A Guift I warrant.
924   *Why this hits right: I dreampt of a Siluer Bason & Ewre
925   *to night. {Flaminius}, honest {Flaminius}, you are verie re-spectiuely
926   *welcome sir. Fill me some Wine. And how
927   *does that Honourable, Compleate, Free- hearted Gentle-man
928   *of Athens, thy very bountifull good Lord and May-ster?
929   _
930    <S {Flam}.> His health is well sir.
931   *<S {Luc}.> I am right glad that his health is well sir: and
932   *what hast thou there vnder thy Cloake, pretty {Flaminius}?
933   *<S {Flam}.> Faith, nothing but an empty box Sir, which in
934   *my Lords behalfe, I come to intreat your Honor to sup-ply:
935   *who hauing great and instant occasion to vse fiftie
936   *Talents, hath sent to your Lordship to furnish him: no-thing
937    doubting your present assistance therein.
938   *<S {Luc}.> La, la, la, la: Nothing doubting sayes hee? Alas
939   *good Lord, a Noble Gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep
940   *so good a house. Many a time and often I #ha din'd with
941   *him, and told him on't, and come againe to supper to him
942   *of purpose, to haue him spend lesse, and yet he wold em-brace
943   *no counsell, take no warning by my comming, eue-ry
944   *man has his fault, and honesty is his. I #ha told him on't,
945    but I could nere get him from't.
946    <D {Enter Seruant with Wine}.>
947    <S {Ser}.> Please your Lordship, heere is the Wine.
948    <S {Luc}.> {Flaminius}, I haue noted thee alwayes wise.
949    Heere's to thee.
950    <S {Flam}.> Your Lordship speakes your pleasure.
951   *<S {Luc}.> I haue obserued thee alwayes for a towardlie
952   *prompt spirit, giue thee thy due, and one that knowes
953   *what belongs to reason; and canst vse the time wel, if the
954   *time vse thee well. Good parts in thee; get you gone sir-rah.
955   *Draw neerer honest {Flaminius}. Thy Lords a boun-tifull
956   *Gentleman, but thou art wise, and thou know'st
957   *well enough (although thou com'st to me) that this is no
958   *time to lend money, especially vpon bare friendshippe
959   *without securitie. Here's three {Solidares} for thee, good
960   *Boy winke at me, and say thou saw'st mee not. Fare thee
961    well.
962    <S {Flam}.> Is't possible the world should so much differ,
963    And we aliue that liued? Fly damned basenesse
964    To him that worships thee.
965   *<S {Luc}.> Ha? Now I see thou art a Foole, and fit for thy
966    Master.  <D {Exit L[ucullus]}.>
967   *<S {Flam}.> May these adde to the number y may scald thee:
968    Let moulten Coine be thy damnation,
969    Thou disease of a friend, and not himselfe:
970    Has friendship such a faint and milkie heart,
971    It turnes in lesse then two nights? O you Gods!
972    I feele my Masters passion. This Slaue vnto his Honor,
973    Has my Lords meate in him:
974    Why should it thriue, and turne to Nutriment,
975    When he is turn'd to poyson?
976    O may Diseases onely worke vpon't:
977    And when he's sicke to death, let not that part of Nature
978    Which my Lord payd for, be of any power
979    To expell sicknesse, but prolong his hower.  <D {Exit}.>
980    <D {Enter Lucius, with three strangers}.>
981   *<S {Luc}.> Who the Lord {Timon}? He is my very good friend
982    and an Honourable Gentleman.
983   *<S 1> We know him for no lesse, thogh we are but stran-gers
984   *to him. But I can tell you one thing my Lord, and
985   *which I heare from common rumours, now Lord {Timons}
986   *happie howres are done and past, and his estate shrinkes
987    from him.
988   *<S {Lucius}.> Fye no, doe not beleeue it: hee cannot want
989    for money.
990   *<S 2> But beleeue you this my Lord, that not long agoe,
991   *one of his men was with the Lord {Lucullus}, to borrow so
992   *many Talents, nay vrg'd extreamly for't, and shewed
      <P Gg5v>
993    what necessity belong'd too't, and yet was deny'de.
994    <S {Luci}.> How?
995    <S 2> I tell you, deny'de my Lord.
996   *<S {Luci}.> What a strange case was that? Now before the
997   *Gods I am asham'd on't. Denied that honourable man?
998   *There was verie little Honour shew'd in't. For my owne
999   *part, I must needes confesse, I haue receyued some small
1000  *kindnesses from him, as Money, Plate, Iewels, and such
1001  *like Trifles; nothing comparing to his: yet had hee mi-stooke
1002  *him, and sent to me, I should ne're haue denied his
1003   Occasion so many Talents.
1004   <D {Enter Seruilius}.>
1005  *<S {Seruil}.> See, by good hap yonders my Lord, I haue
1006   swet to see his Honor. My Honor'd Lord.
1007  *<S {Lucil}.> {Seruilius}? You are kindely met sir. Farthewell,
1008  *commend me to thy Honourable vertuous Lord, my ve-ry
1009   exquisite Friend.
1010  *<S {Seruil}.> May it please your Honour, my Lord hath
1011   sent===
1012  *<S {Luci}.> Ha? what ha's he sent? I am so much endeered
1013  *to that Lord; hee's euer sending: how shall I thank him
1014   think'st thou? And what has he sent now?
1015  *<S {Seruil}.> #Has onely sent his present Occasion now my
1016  *Lord: requesting your Lordship to supply his instant vse
1017   with so many Talents.
1018   <S {Lucil}.> I know his Lordship is but merry with me,
1019   He cannot want fifty fiue hundred Talents.
1020  *<S {Seruil}.> But in the mean time he wants lesse my Lord.
1021   If his occasion were not vertuous,
1022   I should not vrge it halfe so faithfully.
1023   <S {Luc}.> Dost thou speake seriously {Seruilius}?
1024   <S {Seruil}.> Vpon my soule 'tis true Sir.
1025  *<S {Luci}.> What a wicked Beast was I to disfurnish my
1026  *self against such a good time, when I might #ha shewn my
1027  *selfe Honourable? How vnluckily it hapned, that I shold
1028  *Purchase the day before for a little part, and vndo a great
1029  *deale of Honour? {Seruilius}, now before the Gods I am
1030  *not able to do (the more beast I say) I was sending to vse
1031  *Lord {Timon} my selfe, these Gentlemen can witnesse; but
1032  *I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now.
1033  *Commend me bountifully to his good Lordship, and I
1034  *hope his Honor will conceiue the fairest of mee, because
1035  *I haue no power to be kinde. And tell him this from me,
1036  *I count it one of my greatest afflictions say, that I cannot
1037  *pleasure such an Honourable Gentleman. Good {Seruili-us},
1038  *will you befriend mee so farre, as to vse mine owne
1039   words to him?
1040   <S {Ser}.> Yes sir, I shall.  <D {Exit Seruil[ius]}.>
1041   <S {Lucil}.> Ile looke you out a good turne {Seruilius}.
1042   True as you said, {Timon} is shrunke indeede,
1043   And he that's once deny'de, will hardly speede.  <D {Exit}.>
1044   <S 1> Do you obserue this {Hostilius}?
1045   <S 2> #I, #to well.
1046   <S 1> Why this is the worlds soule,
1047   And iust of the same peece
1048   Is euery Flatterers sport: who can call him his Friend
1049   That dips in the same dish? For in my knowing
1050   {#Timon} has bin this Lords Father,
1051   And kept his credit with his purse:
1052   Supported his estate, nay {Timons} money
1053   Has paid his men their wages. He ne're drinkes,
1054   But {Timons} Siluer treads vpon his Lip,
1055   And yet, oh see the monstrousnesse of man,
1056   When he lookes out in an vngratefull shape;
1057   He does deny him (in respect of his)
1058   What charitable men affoord to Beggers.
1059   <S 3> Religion grones at it.
1060  *<S 1> For mine owne part, I neuer tasted {Timon} in my life
1061   Nor came any of his bounties ouer me,
1062   To marke me for his Friend. Yet I protest,
1063   For his right Noble minde, illustrious Vertue,
1064   And Honourable Carriage,
1065   Had his necessity made vse of me,
1066   I would haue put my wealth into Donation,
1067   And the best halfe should haue return'd to him,
1068   So much I loue his heart: But I perceiue,
1069   Men must learne now with pitty to dispence,
1070   For Policy sits aboue Conscience.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1071   <D {Enter a third seruant with Sempronius, another}
1072   {of Timons Friends}.>
1073   <S {Semp}.> Must he needs trouble me in't? Hum.
1074   'Boue all others?
1075   He might haue tried Lord {Lucius}, or {Lucullus},
1076   And now {Ventidgius} is wealthy too,
1077   Whom he redeem'd from prison. All these
1078   Owes their estates vnto him.
1079   <S {Ser}.> My Lord,
1080   They haue all bin touch'd, and found Base- Mettle,
1081   For they haue all denied him.
1082   <S {Semp}.> How? Haue they deny'de him?
1083   Has {Ventidgius} and {Lucullus} deny'de him,
1084   And does he send to me? Three? Humh?
1085   It shewes but little loue, or iudgement in him.
1086   Must I be his last Refuge? His Friends (like Physitians)
1087   Thriue, giue him ouer: Must I take th' Cure vpon me?
1088   #Has much disgrac'd me in't, I'me angry at him,
1089  *That might haue knowne my place. I see no sense for't,
1090   But his Occasions might haue wooed me first:
1091   For in my conscience, I was the first man
1092   That ere receiued guift from him.
1093   And does he thinke so backwardly of me now,
1094   That Ile requite it last? No:
1095   So it may proue an Argument of Laughter
1096   To th' rest, and 'mong'st Lords be thought a Foole:
1097   I'de rather then the worth of thrice the summe,
1098   #Had sent to me first, but for my mindes sake:
1099   I'de such a courage to do him good. But now returne,
1100   And with their faint reply, this answer ioyne;
1101  *Who bates mine Honor, shall not know my Coyne.  <D {Exit}>
1102  *<S {Ser}.> Excellent: Your Lordships a goodly Villain: the
1103  *diuell knew not what he did, when hee made man Poli-ticke;
1104  *he crossed himselfe by't: and I cannot thinke, but
1105  *in the end, the Villanies of man will set him cleere. How
1106  *fairely this Lord striues to appeare foule? Takes Vertu-ous
1107  *Copies to be wicked: like those, that vnder hotte ar-dent
1108  *zeale, would set whole Realmes on fire, of such a na-ture
1109   is his politike loue.
1110   This was my Lords best hope, now all are fled
1111   Saue onely the Gods. Now his Friends are dead,
1112   Doores that were ne're acquainted with their Wards
1113   Many a bounteous yeere, must be imploy'd
1114   Now to guard sure their Master:
1115   And this is all a liberall course allowes,
1116  *Who cannot keepe his wealth, must keep his house.  <D {Exit}.>
1117  *<D {Enter Varro's man, meeting others. All Timons Creditors to}
1118   {wait for his comming out. Then enter Lucius}
1119   {and Hortensius}.>
1120  *<S {Var.man}.> Well met, goodmorrow {Titus} & {Hortensius}
      <P Gg6>
1121   <S {Tit}.> The like to you kinde {Varro}.
1122   <S {Hort}.> {Lucius}, what do we meet together?
1123  *<S {Luci}.> #I, and I think one businesse do's command vs all.
1124   For mine is money.
1125   <S {Tit}.> So is theirs, and ours.
1126   <D {Enter Philotus}.>
1127   <S {Luci}.> And sir {Philotus} too.
1128   <S {Phil}.> Good day at once.
1129   <S {Luci}.> Welcome good Brother.
1130   What do you thinke the houre?
1131   <S {Phil}.> Labouring for Nine.
1132   <S {Luci}.> So much?
1133   <S {Phil}.> Is not my Lord seene yet?
1134   <S {Luci}.> Not yet.
1135   <S {Phil}.> I wonder on't, he was wont to shine at seauen.
1136   <S {Luci}.> #I, but the dayes are waxt shorter with him:
1137   You must consider, that a Prodigall course
1138   Is like the Sunnes, but not like his recouerable, I feare:
1139  *'Tis deepest Winter in Lord {Timons} purse, that is: One
1140   may reach deepe enough, and yet finde little.
1141   <S {Phil}.> I am of your feare, for that.
1142   <S {Tit}.> Ile shew you how t' obserue a strange euent:
1143   Your Lord sends now for Money?
1144   <S {Hort}.> Most true, he doe's.
1145   <S {Tit}.> And he weares Iewels now of {Timons} guift,
1146   For which I waite for money.
1147   <S {Hort}.> It is against my heart.
1148   <S {Luci}.> Marke how strange it showes,
1149   {#Timon} in this, should pay more then he owes:
1150   And e'ne as if your Lord should weare rich Iewels,
1151   And send for money for 'em.
1152   <S {Hort}.> I'me weary of this Charge,
1153   The Gods can witnesse:
1154   I know my Lord hath spent of {Timons} wealth,
1155   And now Ingratitude, makes it worse then stealth.
1156   <S {Varro}.> Yes, mine's three thousand Crownes:
1157   What's yours?
1158   <S {Luci}.> Fiue thousand mine.
1159  *<S {Varro}.> 'Tis much deepe, and it should seem by th' sum
1160   Your Masters confidence was aboue mine,
1161   Else surely his had equall'd.
1162   <D {Enter Flaminius}.>
1163   <S {Tit}.> One of Lord {Timons} men.
1164  *<S {Luc}.> {Flaminius}? Sir, a word: Pray is my Lord readie
1165   to come forth?
1166   <S {Flam}.> No, indeed he is not.
1167  *<S {Tit}.> We attend his Lordship: pray signifie so much.
1168  *<S {Flam}.> I need not tell him that, he knowes you are too |(diligent.
1169   <D {Enter Steward in a Cloake, muffled}.>
1170   <S {Luci}.> Ha: is not that his Steward muffled so?
1171   He goes away in a Clowd: Call him, call him.
1172   <S {Tit}.> Do you heare, sir?
1173   <S 2.{Varro}.> By your leaue, sir.
1174   <S {Stew}.> What do ye aske of me, my Friend.
1175   <S {Tit}.> We waite for certaine Money heere, sir.
1176   <S {Stew}.> #I, if Money were as certaine as your waiting,
1177   'Twere sure enough.
1178   Why then preferr'd you not your summes and Billes
1179   When your false Masters eate of my Lords meat?
1180   Then they could smile, and fawne vpon his debts.
1181  *And take downe th' Intrest into their glutt'nous Mawes.
1182   You do your selues but wrong, to stirre me vp,
1183   Let me passe quietly:
1184   Beleeue't, my Lord and I haue made an end,
1185   I haue no more to reckon, he to spend.
1186   <S {Luci}.> #I, but this answer will not serue.
1187   <S {Stew}.> If't 'twill not serue, 'tis not so base as you,
1188   For you serue Knaues.
1189   <S 1.{Varro}.> How? What does his casheer'd Worship
1190   mutter?
1191  *<S 2.{Varro}.> No matter what, hee's poore, and that's re-uenge
1192  *enough. Who can speake broader, then hee that
1193  *has no house to put his head in? Such may rayle against
1194   great buildings.
1195   <D {Enter Seruilius}.>
1196  *<S {Tit}.> Oh heere's {Seruilius}: now wee shall know some
1197   answere.
1198  *<S {Seru}.> If I might beseech you Gentlemen, to repayre
1199  *some other houre, I should deriue much from't. For tak't
1200  *of my soule, my Lord leanes wondrously to discontent:
1201  *His comfortable temper has forsooke him, he's much out
1202   of health, and keepes his Chamber.
1203   <S {Luci}.> Many do keepe their Chambers, are not sicke:
1204   And if it be so farre beyond his health,
1205   Me thinkes he should the sooner pay his debts,
1206   And make a cleere way to the Gods.
1207   <S {Seruil}.> Good Gods.
1208   <S {Titus}.> We cannot take this for answer, sir.
1209  *<S {Flaminius within}.> {Seruilius} helpe, my Lord, my Lord.
1210   <D {Enter Timon in a rage}.>
1211  *<S {Tim}.> What, are my dores oppos'd against my passage?
1212   Haue I bin euer free, and must my house
1213   Be my retentiue Enemy? My Gaole?
1214   The place which I haue Feasted, does it now
1215   (Like all Mankinde) shew me an Iron heart?
1216   <S {Luci}.> Put in now {Titus}.
1217   <S {Tit}.> My Lord, heere is my Bill.
1218   <S {Luci}.> Here's mine.
1219   <S 1.{Var}.> And mine, my Lord.
1220   <S 2.{Var}.> And ours, my Lord.
1221   <S {Philo}.> All our Billes.
1222  *<S {Tim}.> Knocke me downe with 'em, cleaue mee to the
1223   Girdle.
1224   <S {Luc}.> Alas, my Lord.
1225   <S {Tim}.> Cut my heart in summes.
1226   <S {Tit}.> Mine, fifty Talents.
1227   <S {Tim}.> Tell out my blood.
1228   <S {Luc}.> Fiue thousand Crownes, my Lord.
1229   <S {Tim}.> Fiue thousand drops payes that.
1230   What yours? and yours?
1231   <S 1.{Var}.> My Lord.
1232   <S 2.{Var}.> My Lord.
1233  *<S {Tim}.> Teare me, take me, and the Gods fall vpon you.
1234   <D {Exit Timon}.>
1235  *<S {Hort}.> Faith I perceiue our Masters may throwe their
1236  *caps at their money, these debts may well be call'd despe-rate
1237   ones, for a madman owes 'em.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1238   <D {Enter Timon}.>
1239  *<S {Timon}.> They haue e'ene put my breath from mee the
1240   slaues. Creditors? Diuels.
1241   <S {Stew}.> My deere Lord.
1242   <S {Tim}.> What if it should be so?
1243   <S {Stew}.> My Lord.
1244   <S {Tim}.> Ile haue it so. My Steward?
1245   <S {Stew}.> Heere my Lord.
1246   <S {Tim}.> So fitly? Go, bid all my Friends againe,
1247   {#Lucius}, {Lucullus}, and {Sempronius Vllorxa}: All,
1248   Ile once more feast the Rascals.
1249  *<S {Stew}.> O my Lord, you onely speake from your distra-cted
1250  *soule; there's not so much left to furnish out a mo-derate
1251   Table.
      <P Gg6v>
1252   <S {Tim}.> Be it not in thy care:
1253   Go I charge thee, inuite them all, let in the tide
1254  *Of Knaues once more: my Cooke and Ile prouide.  <D {Exeunt}>
1255  *<D {Enter three Senators at one doore, Alcibiades meeting them},
1256   {with Attendants}.>
1257   <S 1.{Sen}.> My Lord, you haue my voyce, too't,
1258   The faults Bloody:
1259   'Tis necessary he should dye:
1260   Nothing imboldens sinne so much, as Mercy.
1261   <S 2> Most true; the Law shall bruise 'em.
1262   <S {Alc}.> Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate.
1263   <S 1> Now Captaine.
1264   <S {Alc}.> I am an humble Sutor to your Vertues;
1265   For pitty is the vertue of the Law,
1266   And none but Tyrants vse it cruelly.
1267   It pleases time and Fortune to lye heauie
1268   Vpon a Friend of mine, who in hot blood
1269   Hath stept into the Law: which is past depth
1270   To those that (without heede) do plundge intoo't.
1271   He is a Man (setting his Fate aside) of comely Vertues,
1272   Nor did he soyle the fact with Cowardice.
1273   (And Honour in him, which buyes out his fault)
1274   But with a Noble Fury, and faire spirit,
1275   Seeing his Reputation touch'd to death,
1276   He did oppose his Foe:
1277   And with such sober and vnnoted passion
1278   He did behooue his anger ere 'twas spent,
1279   As if he had but prou'd an Argument.
1280   <S 1.{Sen}.> You vndergo too strict a Paradox,
1281   Striuing to make an vgly deed looke faire:
1282   Your words haue tooke such paines, as if they labour'd
1283  *To bring Man- slaughter into forme, and set Quarrelling
1284   Vpon the head of Valour; which indeede
1285   Is Valour mis- begot, and came into the world,
1286   When Sects, and Factions were newly borne.
1287   Hee's truly Valiant, that can wisely suffer
1288   The worst that man can breath,
1289   And make his Wrongs, his Out- sides,
1290   To weare them like his Rayment, carelessely,
1291   And ne're preferre his iniuries to his heart,
1292   To bring it into danger.
1293   If Wrongs be euilles, and inforce vs kill,
1294   What Folly 'tis, to hazard life for #Ill.
1295   <S {Alci}.> My Lord.
1296   <S 1.{Sen}.> You cannot make grosse sinnes looke cleare,
1297   To reuenge is no Valour, but to beare.
1298   <S {Alci}.> My Lords, then vnder fauour, pardon me,
1299   If I speake like a Captaine.
1300   Why do fond men expose themselues to Battell,
1301   And not endure all threats? Sleepe vpon't,
1302   And let the Foes quietly cut their Throats
1303   Without repugnancy? If there be
1304   Such Valour in the bearing, what make wee
1305   Abroad? Why then, Women are more valiant
1306   That stay at home, if Bearing carry it:
1307   And the Asse, more Captaine then the Lyon?
1308   The fellow loaden with Irons, wiser then the Iudge?
1309   If Wisedome be in suffering. Oh my Lords,
1310   As you are great, be pittifully Good,
1311   Who cannot condemne rashnesse in cold blood?
1312   To kill, I grant, is sinnes extreamest Gust,
1313   But in defence, by Mercy, 'tis most iust.
1314   To be in Anger, is impietie:
1315   But who is Man, that is not Angrie.
1316   Weigh but the Crime with this.
1317   <S 2.{Sen}.> You breath in vaine.
1318   <S {Alci}.> In vaine?
1319   His seruice done at Lacedemon, and Bizantium,
1320   Were a sufficient briber for his life.
1321   <S 1> What's that?
1322   <S {Alc}.> Why say my Lords #ha's done faire seruice,
1323   And slaine in fight many of your enemies:
1324   How full of valour did he beare himselfe
1325   In the last Conflict, and made plenteous wounds?
1326   <S 2> He has made too much plenty with him:
1327   He's a sworne Riotor, he has a sinne
1328   That often drownes him, and takes his valour prisoner.
1329   If there were no Foes, that were enough
1330   To ouercome him. In that Beastly furie,
1331   He has bin knowne to commit outrages,
1332   And cherrish Factions. 'Tis inferr'd to vs,
1333   His dayes are foule, and his drinke dangerous.
1334   <S 1> He dyes.
1335   <S {Alci}.> Hard fate: he might haue dyed in warre.
1336   My Lords, if not for any parts in him,
1337   Though his right arme might purchase his owne time,
1338   And be in debt to none: yet more to moue you,
1339   Take my deserts to his, and ioyne 'em both.
1340   And for I know, your reuerend Ages loue Security,
1341   Ile pawne my Victories, all my Honour to you
1342   Vpon his good returnes.
1343   If by this Crime, he owes the Law his life,
1344   Why let the Warre receiue't in valiant gore,
1345   For Law is strict, and Warre is nothing more.
1346   <S 1> We are for Law, he dyes, vrge it no more
1347   On height of our displeasure: Friend, or Brother,
1348   He forfeits his owne blood, that spilles another.
1349   <S {Alc}.> Must it be so? It must not bee:
1350   My Lords, I do beseech you know mee.
1351   <S 2> How?
1352   <S {Alc}.> Call me to your remembrances.
1353   <S 3> What.
1354   <S {Alc}.> I cannot thinke but your Age has forgot me,
1355   It could not else be, I should proue so bace,
1356   To sue and be deny'de such common Grace.
1357   My wounds ake at you.
1358   <S 1> Do you dare our anger?
1359   'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
1360   We banish thee for euer.
1361   <S {Alc}.> Banish me?
1362   Banish your dotage, banish vsurie,
1363   That makes the Senate vgly.
1364   <S 1> If after two dayes shine, Athens containe thee,
1365   Attend our waightier Iudgement.
1366   And not to swell our Spirit,
1367   He shall be executed presently.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1368   <S {Alc}.> Now the Gods keepe you old enough,
1369   That you may liue
1370   Onely in bone, that none may looke on you.
1371   I'm worse then mad: I haue kept backe their Foes
1372   While they haue told their Money, and let out
1373   Their Coine vpon large interest. I my selfe,
1374   Rich onely in large hurts. All those, for this?
1375   Is this the Balsome, that the vsuring Senat
1376   Powres into Captaines wounds? Banishment.
1377   It comes not #ill: I hate not to be banisht,
1378   It is a cause worthy my Spleene and Furie,
1379   That I may strike at Athens. Ile cheere vp
1380   My discontented Troopes, and lay for hearts;
1381   'Tis Honour with most Lands to be at ods,
1382   Souldiers should brooke as little wrongs as Gods.  <D {Exit}.>
      <P hh1>
1383   <D {Enter diuers Friends at seuerall doores}.>
1384   <S 1> The good time of day to you, sir.
1385  *<S 2> I also wish it to you: I thinke this Honorable Lord
1386   did but try vs this other day.
1387  *<S 1> Vpon that were my thoughts tyring when wee en-countred.
1388  *I hope it is not so low with him as he made it
1389   seeme in the triall of his seuerall Friends.
1390  *<S 2> It should not be, by the perswasion of his new Fea-sting.
1391  _
1392  *<S 1> I should thinke so. He hath sent mee an earnest in-uiting,
1393  *which many my neere occasions did vrge mee to
1394  *put off: but he hath coniur'd mee beyond them, and I
1395   must needs appeare.
1396  *<S 2> In like manner was I in debt to my importunat bu-sinesse,
1397  *but he would not heare my excuse. I am sorrie,
1398  *when he sent to borrow of mee, that my Prouision was
1399   out.
1400  *<S 1> I am sicke of that greefe too, as I vnderstand how all
1401   things go.
1402  *<S 2> Euery man heares so: what would hee haue borro-wed
1403   of you?
1404   <S 1> A thousand Peeces.
1405   <S 2> A thousand Peeces?
1406   <S 1> What of you?
1407   <S 2> He sent to me sir=== Heere he comes.
1408   <D {Enter Timon and Attendants}.>
1409   <S {Tim}.> With all my heart Gentlemen both; and how
1410   fare you?
1411   <S 1> Euer at the best, hearing well of your Lordship.
1412  *<S 2> The Swallow followes not Summer more willing,
1413   then we your Lordship.
1414  *<S {Tim}.> Nor more willingly leaues Winter, such Sum-mer
1415  *Birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not re-compence
1416  *this long stay: Feast your eares with the Mu-sicke
1417  *awhile: If they will fare so harshly o'th' Trumpets
1418   sound: we shall too't presently.
1419  *<S 1> I hope it remaines not vnkindely with your Lord-ship,
1420   that I return'd you an empty Messenger.
1421   <S {Tim}.> O sir, let it not trouble you.
1422   <S 2> My Noble Lord.
1423   <S {Tim}.> Ah my good Friend, what cheere?
1424   <D {The Banket brought in}.>
1425  *<S 2> My most Honorable Lord, I am e'ne sick of shame,
1426  *that when your Lordship this other day sent to me, I was
1427   so vnfortunate a Beggar.
1428   <S {Tim}.> Thinke not on't, sir.
1429   <S 2> If you had sent but two houres before.
1430   <S {Tim}.> Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
1431   Come bring in all together.
1432   <S 2> All couer'd Dishes.
1433   <S 1> Royall Cheare, I warrant you.
1434  *<S 3> Doubt not that, if money and the season can yeild it
1435   <S 1> How do you? What's the newes?
1436   <S 3> {Alcibiades} is banish'd: heare you of it?
1437   <S {Both}.> {Alcibiades} banish'd?
1438   <S 3> 'Tis so, be sure of it.
1439   <S 1> How? How?
1440   <S 2> I pray you vpon what?
1441   <S {Tim}.> My worthy Friends, will you draw neere?
1442  *<S 3> Ile tell you more anon. Here's a Noble feast toward
1443   <S 2> This is the old man still.
1444   <S 3> #Wilt hold? #Wilt hold?
1445   <S 2> It do's: but time will, and so.
1446   <S 3> I do conceyue.
1447  *<S {Tim}.> Each man to his stoole, with that spurre as hee
1448  *would to the lip of his Mistris: your dyet shall bee in all
1449  *places alike. Make not a Citie Feast of it, to let the meat
1450   coole, ere we can agree vpon the first place. Sit, sit.
1451   The Gods require our Thankes.
1452  *{You great Benefactors, sprinkle our Society with Thanke-fulnesse}.
1453  *{For your owne guifts, make your selues prais'd: But}
1454  *{reserue still to giue, least your Deities be despised. Lend to each}
1455  *{man enough, that one neede not lend to another. For were your}
1456  *{Godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the Gods. Make}
1457  *{the Meate be beloued, more then the Man that giues it. Let}
1458  *{no Assembly of Twenty, be without a score of Villaines. If there}
1459  *{sit twelue Women at the Table, let a dozen of them bee as they}
1460  *{are. The rest of your Fees, O Gods, the Senators of Athens},
1461  *{together with the common legge of People, what is amisse in}
1462  *{them, you Gods, make suteable for destruction. For these my}
1463  *{present Friends, as they are to mee nothing, so in nothing blesse}
1464   {them, and to nothing are they welcome}.
1465   Vncouer Dogges, and lap.
1466   <S {Some} {speake}.> What do's his Lordship meane?
1467   <S {Some} {other}.> I know not.
1468   <S {Timon}.> May you a better Feast neuer behold
1469  *You knot of Mouth- Friends: Smoke, & lukewarm water
1470   Is your perfection. This is {Timons} last,
1471   Who stucke and spangled you with Flatteries,
1472   Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
1473   Your reeking villany. Liue loath'd, and long
1474   Most smiling, smooth, detested Parasites,
1475   Curteous Destroyers, affable Wolues, meeke Beares:
1476   You Fooles of Fortune, Trencher- friends, Times Flyes,
1477   Cap and knee- Slaues, vapours, and Minute Iackes.
1478   Of Man and Beast, the infinite Maladie
1479   Crust you quite o're. What do'st thou go?
1480   Soft, take thy Physicke first; thou too, and thou:
1481   Stay I will lend thee money, borrow none.
1482   What? All in Motion? Henceforth be no Feast,
1483   Whereat a Villaine's not a welcome Guest.
1484   Burne house, sinke Athens, henceforth hated be
1485   Of {Timon} Man, and all Humanity.  <D {Exit}>
1486   <D {Enter the Senators, with other Lords}.>
1487   <S 1> How now, my Lords?
1488   <S 2> Know you the quality of Lord {Timons} fury?
1489   <S 3> Push, did you see my Cap?
1490   <S 4> I haue lost my Gowne.
1491  *<S 1> He's but a mad Lord, & nought but humors swaies
1492  *him. He gaue me a Iewell th' other day, and now hee has
1493   beate it out of my hat.
1494   Did you see my Iewell?
1495   <S 2> Did you see my Cap.
1496   <S 3> Heere 'tis.
1497   <S 4> Heere lyes my Gowne.
1498   <S 1> Let's make no stay.
1499   <S 2> Lord {Timon}s mad.
1500   <S 3> I feel't vpon my bones.
1501   <S 4> One day he giues vs Diamonds, next day stones.
1502   <D {Exeunt the Senators}.>
      <A S>
1503   <D {Enter Timon}.>
1504   <S {Tim}.> Let me looke backe vpon thee. O thou Wall
1505   That girdles in those Wolues, diue in the earth,
1506   And fence not Athens. Matrons, turne incontinent,
1507   Obedience fayle in Children: Slaues and Fooles
      <P hh1v>
1508   Plucke the graue wrinkled Senate from the Bench,
1509   And minister in their steeds, to generall Filthes.
1510   Conuert o'th' Instant greene Virginity,
1511   Doo't in your Parents eyes. Bankrupts, hold fast
1512   Rather then render backe; out with your Kniues,
1513  *And cut your Trusters throates. Bound Seruants, steale,
1514   Large- handed Robbers your graue Masters are,
1515   And pill by Law. Maide, to thy Masters bed,
1516   Thy Mistris is o'th' Brothell. Some of sixteen,
1517   Plucke the lyn'd Crutch from thy old limping Sire,
1518   With it, beate out his Braines. Piety, and Feare,
1519   Religion to the Gods, Peace, Iustice, Truth,
1520   Domesticke awe, Night- rest, and Neighbour-hood,
1521   Instruction, Manners, Mysteries, and Trades,
1522   Degrees, Obseruances, Customes, and Lawes,
1523   Decline to your confounding contraries.
1524   And yet Confusion liue: Plagues incident to men,
1525   Your potent and infectious Feauors, heape
1526   On Athens ripe for stroke. Thou cold Sciatica,
1527   Cripple our Senators, that their limbes may halt
1528   As lamely as their Manners. Lust, and Libertie
1529   Creepe in the Mindes and Marrowes of our youth,
1530   That 'gainst the streame of Vertue they may striue,
1531   And drowne themselues in Riot. Itches, Blaines,
1532   So we all th' Athenian bosomes, and their crop
1533   Be generall Leprosie: Breath, infect breath,
1534   That their Society (as their Friendship) may
1535   Be meerely poyson. Nothing Ile beare from thee
1536   But nakednesse, thou detestable Towne,
1537   Take thou that too, with multiplying Bannes:
1538   {#Timon} will to the Woods, where he shall finde
1539   Th' vnkindest Beast, more kinder then Mankinde.
1540   The Gods confound (heare me you good Gods all)
1541   Th' Athenians both within and out that Wall:
1542   And graunt as {Timon} growes, his hate may grow
1543   To the whole race of Mankinde, high and low.
1544   Amen.  <D {Exit}.>
1545   <D {Enter Steward with two or three Seruants}.>
1546   <S 1> Heare you M[aster]. Steward, where's our Master?
1547   Are we vndone, cast off, nothing remaining?
1548  *<S {Stew}.> Alack my Fellowes, what should I say to you?
1549   Let me be recorded by the righteous Gods,
1550   I am as poore as you.
1551   <S 1> Such a House broke?
1552   So Noble a Master falne, all gone, and not
1553   One Friend to take his Fortune by the arme,
1554   And go along with him.
1555   <S 2> As we do turne our backes
1556   From our Companion, throwne into his graue,
1557   So his Familiars to his buried Fortunes
1558   Slinke all away, leaue their false vowes with him
1559   Like empty purses pickt; and his poore selfe
1560   A dedicated Beggar to the Ayre,
1561   With his disease, of all shunn'd pouerty,
1562   Walkes like contempt alone. More of our Fellowes.
1563   <D {Enter other Seruants}.>
1564   <S {Stew}.> All broken Implements of a ruin'd house.
1565   <S 3> Yet do our hearts weare {Timons} Liuery,
1566   That see I by our Faces: we are Fellowes still,
1567   Seruing alike in sorrow: Leak'd is our Barke,
1568   And we poore Mates, stand on the dying Decke,
1569   Hearing the Surges threat: we must all part
1570   Into this Sea of Ayre.
1571   <S {Stew}.> Good Fellowes all,
1572   The latest of my wealth Ile share among'st you.
1573   Where euer we shall meete, for {Timons} sake,
1574   Let's yet be Fellowes. Let's shake our heads, and say
1575   As 'twere a Knell vnto our Masters Fortunes,
1576   We haue seene better dayes. Let each take some:
1577   Nay put out all your hands: Not one word more,
1578   Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poore.
1579   <D {Embrace and part seuerall wayes}.>
      <A M>
1580   Oh the fierce wretchednesse that Glory brings vs!
1581   Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
1582   Since Riches point to Misery and Contempt?
1583   Who would be so mock'd with Glory, or to liue
1584   But in a Dreame of Friendship,
1585   To haue his pompe, and all what state compounds,
1586   But onely painted like his varnisht Friends:
1587   Poore honest Lord, brought lowe by his owne heart,
1588   Vndone by Goodnesse: Strange vnvsuall blood,
1589   When mans worst sinne is, He do's too much Good.
1590   Who then dares to be halfe so kinde agen?
1591   For Bounty that makes Gods, do still marre Men.
1592   My deerest Lord, blest to be most accurst,
1593   Rich onely to be wretched; thy great Fortunes
1594   Are made thy cheefe Afflictions. Alas (kinde Lord)
1595   Hee's flung in Rage from this ingratefull Seate
1596   Of monstrous Friends:
1597   Nor ha's he with him to supply his life,
1598   Or that which can command it:
1599   Ile follow and enquire him out.
1600   Ile euer serue his minde, with my best #will,
1601   Whilst I haue Gold, Ile be his Steward still.  <D {Exit}.>
      <A S>
1602   <D {Enter Timon in the woods}.>
1603   <S {Tim}.> O blessed breeding Sun, draw from the earth
1604   Rotten humidity: below thy Sisters Orbe
1605   Infect the ayre. Twin'd Brothers of one wombe,
1606   Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
1607   Scarse is diuidant; touch them with seuerall fortunes,
1608   The greater scornes the lesser. Not Nature
1609   (To whom all sores lay siege) can beare great Fortune
1610   But by contempt of Nature.
1611   Raise me this Begger, and deny't that Lord,
1612   The Senators shall beare contempt Hereditary,
1613   The Begger Natiue Honor.
1614   It is the Pastour Lards, the Brothers sides,
1615   The want that makes him leaue: who dares? who dares
1616   In puritie of Manhood stand vpright
1617   And say, this mans a Flatterer. If one be,
1618   So are they all: for euerie grize of Fortune
1619   Is smooth'd by that below. The Learned pate
1620   Duckes to the Golden Foole. All's obliquie:
1621   There's nothing leuell in our cursed Natures
1622   But direct villanie. Therefore be abhorr'd,
1623   All Feasts, Societies, and Throngs of men.
1624   His semblable, yea himselfe {Timon} disdaines,
1625   Destruction phang mankinde; Earth yeeld me Rootes,
1626   Who seekes for better of thee, sawce his pallate
1627   With thy most operant Poyson. What is heere?
1628   Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious Gold?
1629   No Gods, I am no idle Votarist,
1630  *Roots you cleere Heauens. Thus much of this will make
1631   Blacke, white; fowle, faire; wrong, right;
1632   Base, Noble; Old, young; Coward, valiant.
1633  *Ha you Gods! why this? what this, you Gods? why this
1634   Will lugge your Priests and Seruants from your sides:
1635   Plucke stout mens pillowes from below their heads.
      <P hh2>
1636   This yellow Slaue,
1637   Will knit and breake Religions, blesse th' accurst,
1638   Make the hoare Leprosie ador'd, place Theeues,
1639   And giue them Title, knee, and approbation
1640   With Senators on the Bench: This is it
1641   That makes the wappen'd Widdow wed againe;
1642   Shee, whom the Spittle- house, and vlcerous sores,
1643   Would cast the gorge at. This Embalmes and Spices
1644   To'th' Aprill day againe. Come damn'd Earth,
1645   Thou common whore of Mankinde, that puttes oddes
1646   Among the rout of Nations, I will make thee
1647   Do thy right Nature.  <D {March afarre off}.>
1648   Ha? A Drumme? Th'art quicke,
1649   But yet Ile bury thee: Thou't go (strong Theefe)
1650   When Gowty keepers of thee cannot stand:
1651   Nay stay thou out for earnest.
1652  *<D {Enter Alcibiades with Drumme and Fife in warlike manner},
1653   {and Phrynia and Timandra}.>
1654   <S {Alc}.> What art thou there? speake.
1655  *<S {Tim}.> A Beast as thou art. The Canker gnaw thy hart
1656   For shewing me againe the eyes of Man.
1657   <S {Alc}.> What is thy name? Is man so hatefull to thee,
1658   That art thy selfe a Man?
1659   <S {Tim}.> I am {Misantropos}, and hate Mankinde.
1660   For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dogge,
1661   That I might loue thee something.
1662   <S {Alc}.> I know thee well:
1663   But in thy Fortunes am vnlearn'd, and strange.
1664  *<S {Tim}.> I know thee too, and more then that I know thee
1665   I not desire to know. Follow thy Drumme,
1666   With mans blood paint the ground Gules, Gules:
1667   Religious Cannons, ciuill Lawes are cruell,
1668   Then what should warre be? This fell whore of thine,
1669   Hath in her more destruction then thy Sword,
1670   For all her Cherubin looke.
1671   <S {Phrin}.> Thy lips rot off.
1672   <S {Tim}.> I will not kisse thee, then the rot returnes
1673   To thine owne lippes againe.
1674   <S {Alc}.> How came the Noble {Timon} to this change?
1675   <S {Tim}.> As the Moone do's, by wanting light to giue:
1676   But then renew I could not like the Moone,
1677   There were no Sunnes to borrow of.
1678   <S {Alc}.> Noble {Timon}, what friendship may I do thee?
1679   <S {Tim}.> None, but to maintaine my opinion.
1680   <S {Alc}.> What is it {Timon}?
1681   <S {Tim}.> Promise me Friendship, but performe none.
1682  *If thou wilt not promise, the Gods plague thee, for thou
1683  *art a man: if thou do'st performe, confound thee, for
1684   thou art a man.
1685   <S {Alc}.> I haue heard in some sort of thy Miseries.
1686   <S {Tim}.> Thou saw'st them when I had prosperitie.
1687   <S {Alc}.> I see them now, then was a blessed time.
1688   <S {Tim}.> As thine is now, held with a brace of Harlots.
1689   <S {Timan}.> Is this th' Athenian Minion, whom the world
1690   Voic'd so regardfully?
1691   <S {Tim}.> Art thou {Timandra}? <S {Timan}.> Yes.
1692  *<S {Tim}.> Be a whore still, they loue thee not that vse thee,
1693  *giue them diseases, leauing with thee their Lust. Make
1694  *vse of thy salt houres, season the slaues for Tubbes and
1695  *Bathes, bring downe Rose- cheekt youth to the Fubfast,
1696   and the Diet.
1697   <S {Timan}.> Hang thee Monster.
1698   <S {Alc}.> Pardon him sweet {Timandra}, for his wits
1699   Are drown'd and lost in his Calamities.
1700   I haue but little Gold of late, braue {Timon},
1701   The want whereof, doth dayly make reuolt
1702   In my penurious Band. I haue heard and greeu'd
1703   How cursed Athens, mindelesse of thy worth,
1704   Forgetting thy great deeds, when Neighbour states
1705   But for thy Sword and Fortune trod vpon them.
1706   <S {Tim}.> I prythee beate thy Drum, and get thee gone.
1707   <S {Alc}.> I am thy Friend, and pitty thee deere {Timon}.
1708  *<S {Tim}.> How doest thou pitty him whom y dost troble,
1709   I had rather be alone.
1710   <S {Alc}.> Why fare thee well:
1711   Heere is some Gold for thee.
1712   <S {Tim}.> Keepe it, I cannot eate it.
1713   <S {Alc}.> When I haue laid proud Athens on a heape.
1714   <S {Tim}.> Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens.
1715   <S {Alc}.> #I {Timon}, and haue cause.
1716   <S {Tim}.> The Gods confound them all in thy Conquest,
1717   And thee after, when thou hast Conquer'd.
1718   <S {Alc}.> Why me, {Timon}?
1719   <S {Tim}.> That by killing of Villaines
1720   Thou was't borne to conquer my Country.
1721   Put vp thy Gold. Go on, heeres Gold, go on;
1722   Be as a Plannetary plague, when Ioue
1723   Will o're some high- Vic'd City, hang his poyson
1724   In the sicke ayre: let not thy sword skip one:
1725   Pitty not honour'd Age for his white Beard,
1726   He is an Vsurer. Strike me the counterfet Matron,
1727   It is her habite onely, that is honest,
1728   Her selfe's a Bawd. Let not the Virgins cheeke
1729   Make soft thy trenchant Sword: for those Milke pappes
1730   That through the window Barne bore at mens eyes,
1731   Are not within the Leafe of pitty writ,
1732  *But set them down horrible Traitors. Spare not the Babe
1733  *Whose dimpled smiles from Fooles exhaust their mercy;
1734   Thinke it a Bastard, whom the Oracle
1735   Hath doubtfully pronounced, the throat shall cut,
1736   And mince it sans remorse. Sweare against Obiects,
1737   Put Armour on thine eares, and on thine eyes,
1738  *Whose proofe, nor yels of Mothers, Maides, nor Babes,
1739   Nor sight of Priests in holy Vestments bleeding,
1740   Shall pierce a iot. There's Gold to pay thy Souldiers,
1741   Make large confusion: and thy fury spent,
1742   Confounded be thy selfe. Speake not, be gone.
1743  *<S {Alc}.> Hast thou Gold yet, Ile take the Gold thou gi-uest
1744   me, not all thy Counsell.
1745  *<S {Tim}.> Dost thou or dost thou not, Heauens curse vpon
1746   thee.
1747   <S {Both}.> Giue vs some Gold good {Timon}, hast y more?
1748  *<S {Tim}.> Enough to make a Whore forsweare her Trade,
1749   And to make Whores, a Bawd. Hold vp you Sluts
1750   Your Aprons mountant; you are not Othable,
1751   Although I know you'l sweare, terribly sweare
1752   Into strong shudders, and to heauenly Agues
1753   Th' immortall Gods that heare you. Spare your Oathes:
1754   Ile trust to your Conditions, be whores still.
1755   And he whose pious breath seekes to conuert you,
1756   Be strong in Whore, allure him, burne him vp,
1757   Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
1758   And be no turne- coats: yet may your paines six months
1759   Be quite contrary, And Thatch
1760   Your poore thin Roofes with burthens of the dead,
1761   (Some that were hang'd) no matter:
1762   Weare them, betray with them; Whore still,
1763   Paint till a horse may myre vpon your face:
1764   A pox of wrinkles.
1765   <S {Both}.> Well, more Gold, what then?
      <P hh2v>
1766   Beleeue't that wee'l do any thing for Gold.
1767   <S {Tim}.> Consumptions sowe
1768   In hollow bones of man, strike their sharpe shinnes,
1769   And marre mens spurring. Cracke the Lawyers voyce,
1770   That he may neuer more false Title pleade,
1771   Nor sound his Quillets shrilly: Hoare the Flamen,
1772   That scold'st against the quality of flesh,
1773   And not beleeues himselfe. Downe with the Nose,
1774   Downe with it flat, take the Bridge quite away
1775   Of him, that his particular to foresee
1776  *Smels from the generall weale. Make curl'd pate Ruffians |(bald
1777   And let the vnscarr'd Braggerts of the Warre
1778   Deriue some paine from you. Plague all,
1779   That your Actiuity may defeate and quell
1780   The sourse of all Erection. There's more Gold.
1781   Do you damne others, and let this damne you,
1782   And ditches graue you all.
1783  *<S {Both}.> More counsell with more Money, bounteous
1784   {#Timon}.
1785   <S {Tim}.> More whore, more Mischeefe first, I haue gi-uen
1786   you earnest.
1787  *<S {Alc}.> Strike vp the Drum towardes Athens, farewell
1788   {#Timon}: if I thriue well, Ile visit thee againe.
1789   <S {Tim}.> If I hope well, Ile neuer see thee more.
1790   <S {Alc}.> I neuer did thee harme.
1791   <S {Tim}.> Yes, thou spok'st well of me.
1792   <S {Alc}.> Call'st thou that harme?
1793   <S {Tim}.> Men dayly finde it. Get thee away,
1794   And take thy Beagles with thee.
1795   <S {Alc}.> We but offend him, strike.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1796   <S {Tim}.> That Nature being sicke of mans vnkindnesse
1797   Should yet be hungry: Common Mother, thou
1798   Whose wombe vnmeasureable, and infinite brest
1799   Teemes and feeds all: whose selfesame Mettle
1800   Whereof thy proud Childe (arrogant man) is puft,
1801   Engenders the blacke Toad, and Adder blew,
1802   The gilded Newt, and eyelesse venom'd Worme,
1803   With all th' abhorred Births below Crispe Heauen,
1804   Whereon {Hyperions} quickning fire doth shine:
1805   Yeeld him, who all the humane Sonnes do hate,
1806   From foorth thy plenteous bosome, one poore roote:
1807   Enseare thy Fertile and Conceptious wombe,
1808   Let it no more bring out ingratefull man.
1809   Goe great with Tygers, Dragons, Wolues, and Beares,
1810   Teeme with new Monsters, whom thy vpward face
1811   Hath to the Marbled Mansion all aboue
1812   Neuer presented. O, a Root, deare thankes:
1813   Dry vp thy Marrowes, Vines, and Plough- torne Leas,
1814   Whereof ingratefull man with Licourish draughts
1815   And Morsels Vnctious, greases his pure minde,
1816   That from it all Consideration slippes===
1817   <D {Enter Apemantus}.>
1818   More man? Plague, plague.
1819   <S {Ape}.> I was directed hither. Men report,
1820   Thou dost affect my Manners, and dost vse them.
1821  *<S {Tim}.> 'Tis then, because thou dost not keepe a dogge
1822   Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee.
1823   <S {Ape}.> This is in thee a Nature but infected,
1824   A poore vnmanly Melancholly sprung
1825   From change of future. Why this Spade? this place?
1826   This Slaue- like Habit, and these lookes of Care?
1827   Thy Flatterers yet weare Silke, drinke Wine, lye soft,
1828   Hugge their diseas'd Perfumes, and haue forgot
1829   That euer {Timon} was. Shame not these Woods,
1830   By putting on the cunning of a Carper.
1831   Be thou a Flatterer now, and seeke to thriue
1832   By that which ha's vndone thee; hindge thy knee,
1833   And let his very breath whom thou'lt obserue
1834   Blow off thy Cap: praise his most vicious straine,
1835   And call it excellent: thou wast told thus:
1836  *Thou gau'st thine eares (like Tapsters, that bad welcom)
1837   To Knaues, and all approachers: 'Tis most iust
1838   That thou turne Rascall, had'st thou wealth againe,
1839   Rascals should haue't. Do not assume my likenesse.
1840   <S {Tim}.> Were I like thee, I'de throw away my selfe.
1841  *<S {Ape}.> Thou hast cast away thy selfe, being like thy self
1842   A Madman so long, now a Foole: what think'st
1843   That the bleake ayre, thy boysterous Chamberlaine
1844   Will put thy shirt on warme? Will these moyst Trees,
1845   That haue out- liu'd the Eagle, page thy heeles
1846  *And skip when thou point'st out? Will the cold brooke
1847   Candied with Ice, Cawdle thy Morning taste
1848   To cure thy o're- nights surfet? Call the Creatures,
1849   Whose naked Natures liue in all the spight
1850   Of wrekefull Heauen, whose bare vnhoused Trunkes,
1851   To the conflicting Elements expos'd
1852   Answer meere Nature: bid them flatter thee.
1853   O thou shalt finde.
1854   <S {Tim}.> A Foole of thee: depart.
1855   <S {Ape}.> I loue thee better now, then ere I did.
1856   <S {Tim}.> I hate thee worse.
1857   <S {Ape}.> Why?
1858   <S {Tim}.> Thou flatter'st misery.
1859   <S {Ape}.> I flatter not, but say thou art a Caytiffe.
1860   <S {Tim}.> Why do'st thou seeke me out?
1861   <S {Ape}.> To vex thee.
1862   <S {Tim}.> Alwayes a Villaines Office, or a Fooles.
1863   Dost please thy selfe in't?
1864   <S {Ape}.> #I.
1865   <S {Tim}.> What, a Knaue too?
1866   <S {Ape}.> If thou did'st put this sowre cold habit on
1867   To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
1868   Dost it enforcedly: Thou'dst Courtier be againe
1869   Wert thou not Beggar: willing misery
1870   Out- liues: incertaine pompe, is crown'd before:
1871   The one is filling still, neuer compleat:
1872   The other, at high wish: best state Contentlesse,
1873   Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
1874   Worse then the worst, Content.
1875   Thou should'st desire to dye, being miserable.
1876   <S {Tim}.> Not by his breath, that is more miserable.
1877   Thou art a Slaue, whom Fortunes tender arme
1878   With fauour neuer claspt: but bred a Dogge.
1879   Had'st thou like vs from our first swath proceeded,
1880   The sweet degrees that this breefe world affords,
1881   To such as may the passiue drugges of it
1882  *Freely command'st: thou would'st haue plung'd thy self
1883   In generall Riot, melted downe thy youth
1884   In different beds of Lust, and neuer learn'd
1885   The Icie precepts of respect, but followed
1886   The Sugred game before thee. But my selfe,
1887   Who had the world as my Confectionarie,
1888   The mouthes, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men,
1889   At duty more then I could frame employment;
1890   That numberlesse vpon me stucke, as leaues
1891   Do on the Oake, haue with one Winters brush
1892   Fell from their boughes, and left me open, bare,
1893   For euery storme that blowes. I to beare this,
1894   That neuer knew but better, is some burthen:
1895   Thy Nature, did commence in sufferance, Time
1896   Hath made thee hard in't. Why should'st y hate Men?
1897   They neuer flatter'd thee. What hast thou giuen?
      <P hh3>
1898   If thou wilt curse; thy Father (that poore ragge)
1899   Must be thy subiect; who in spight put stuffe
1900   To some shee- Begger, and compounded thee
1901   Poore Rogue, hereditary. Hence, be gone,
1902   If thou hadst not bene borne the worst of men,
1903   Thou hadst bene a Knaue and Flatterer.
1904   <S {Ape}.> Art thou proud yet?
1905   <S {Tim}.> #I, that I am not thee.
1906   <S {Ape}.> #I, that I was no Prodigall.
1907   <S {Tim}.> #I, that I am one now.
1908   Were all the wealth I haue shut vp in thee,
1909   I'ld giue thee leaue to hang it. Get thee gone:
1910   That the whole life of Athens were in this,
1911   Thus would I eate it.
1912   <S {Ape}.> Heere, I will mend thy Feast.
1913   <S {Tim}.> First mend thy company, take away thy selfe.
1914  *<S {Ape}.> So I shall mend mine owne, by'th' lacke of thine
1915   <S {Tim}.> 'Tis not well mended so, it is but botcht;
1916   If not, I would it were.
1917   <S {Ape}.> What would'st thou haue to Athens?
1918   <S {Tim}.> Thee thither in a whirlewind: if thou wilt,
1919   Tell them there I haue Gold, looke, so I haue.
1920   <S {Ape}.> Heere is no vse for Gold.
1921   <S {Tim}.> The best, and truest:
1922   For heere it sleepes, and do's no hyred harme.
1923   <S {Ape}.> Where lyest #a nights {Timon}?
1924   <S {Tim}.> Vnder that's aboue me.
1925   Where feed'st thou a- dayes {Apemantus}?
1926   <S {Ape}.> Where my stomacke findes meate, or rather
1927   where I eate it.
1928  *<S {Tim}.> Would poyson were obedient, & knew my mind
1929   <S {Ape}.> Where would'st thou send it?
1930   <S {Tim}.> To sawce thy dishes.
1931  *<S {Ape}.> The middle of Humanity thou neuer knewest,
1932  *but the extremitie of both ends. When thou wast in thy
1933  *Gilt, and thy Perfume, they mockt thee for too much
1934  *Curiositie: in thy Ragges thou know'st none, but art de-spis'd
1935  *for the contrary. There's a medler for thee, eate it.
1936   <S {Tim}.> On what I hate, I feed not.
1937   <S {Ape}.> Do'st hate a Medler?
1938   <S {Tim}.> #I, though it looke like thee.
1939  *<S {Ape}.> #And th'hadst hated Medlers sooner, y should'st
1940  *haue loued thy selfe better now. What man didd'st thou
1941   euer know vnthrift, that was beloued after his meanes!
1942  *<S {Tim}.> Who without those meanes thou talk'st of, didst
1943   thou euer know belou'd?
1944   <S {Ape}.> My selfe.
1945  *<S {Tim}.> I vnderstand thee: thou had'st some meanes to
1946   keepe a Dogge.
1947  *<S {Apem}.> What things in the world canst thou neerest
1948   compare to thy Flatterers?
1949  *<S {Tim}.> Women neerest, but men: men are the things
1950  *themselues. What would'st thou do with the world {A-pemantus},
1951   if it lay in thy power?
1952   <S {Ape}.> Giue it the Beasts, to be rid of the men.
1953  *<S {Tim}.> Would'st thou haue thy selfe fall in the confu-sion
1954   of men, and remaine a Beast with the Beasts.
1955   <S {Ape}.> #I {Timon}.
1956  *<S {Tim}.> A beastly Ambition, which the Goddes graunt
1957  *thee t' attaine to. If thou wert the Lyon, the Fox would
1958  *beguile thee. if thou wert the Lambe, the Foxe would
1959  *eate thee: if thou wert the Fox, the Lion would suspect
1960  *thee, when peraduenture thou wert accus'd by the Asse:
1961  *If thou wert the Asse, thy dulnesse would torment thee;
1962  *and still thou liu'dst but as a Breakefast to the Wolfe. If
1963  *thou wert the Wolfe, thy greedinesse would afflict thee,
1964  *& oft thou should'st hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert
1965  *thou the Vnicorne, pride and wrath would confound
1966  *thee, and make thine owne selfe the conquest of thy fury.
1967  *Wert thou a Beare, thou would'st be kill'd by the Horse:
1968  *wert thou a Horse, thou would'st be seaz'd by the Leo-pard:
1969  *wert thou a Leopard, thou wert Germane to the
1970  *Lion, and the spottes of thy Kindred, were Iurors on thy
1971  *life. All thy safety were remotion, and thy defence ab-sence.
1972  *What Beast could'st thou bee, that were not sub-iect
1973  *to a Beast: and what a Beast art thou already, that
1974   seest not thy losse in transformation.
1975   <S {Ape}.> If thou could'st please me
1976   With speaking to me, thou might'st
1977   Haue hit vpon it heere.
1978   The Commonwealth of Athens, is become
1979   A Forrest of Beasts.
1980  *<S {Tim}.> How ha's the Asse broke the wall, that thou art
1981   out of the Citie.
1982   <S {Ape}.> Yonder comes a Poet and a Painter:
1983   The plague of Company light vpon thee:
1984   I will feare to catch it, and giue way.
1985   When I know not what else to do,
1986   Ile see thee againe.
1987   <S {Tim}.> When there is nothing liuing but thee,
1988   Thou shalt be welcome.
1989   I had rather be a Beggers Dogge,
1990   Then {Apemantus}.
1991   <S {Ape}.> Thou art the Cap
1992   Of all the Fooles aliue.
1993   <S {Tim}.> Would thou wert cleane enough
1994   To spit vpon.
1995   <S {Ape}.> A plague on thee,
1996   Thou art too bad to curse.
1997   <S {Tim}.> All Villaines
1998   That do stand by thee, are pure.
1999   <S {Ape}.> There is no Leprosie,
2000   But what thou speak'st.
2001   <S {Tim}.> If I name thee, Ile beate thee;
2002   But I should infect my hands.
2003   <S {Ape}.> I would my tongue
2004   Could rot them off.
2005   <S {Tim}.> Away thou issue of a mangie dogge,
2006   Choller does kill me,
2007   That thou art aliue, I swoond to see thee.
2008   <S {Ape}.> Would thou would'st burst.
2009   <S {Tim}.> Away thou tedious Rogue, I am sorry I shall
2010   lose a stone by thee.
2011   <S {Ape}.> Beast.
2012   <S {Tim}.> Slaue.
2013   <S {Ape}.> Toad.
2014   <S {Tim}.> Rogue, Rogue, Rogue.
2015   I am sicke of this false world, and will loue nought
2016   But euen the meere necessities vpon't:
2017   Then {Timon} presently prepare thy graue:
2018   Lye where the light Fome of the Sea may beate
2019   Thy graue stone dayly, make thine Epitaph,
2020   That death in me, at others liues may laugh.
2021   O thou sweete King- killer, and deare diuorce
2022   Twixt naturall Sunne and fire: thou bright defiler
2023   Of {Himens} purest bed, thou valiant Mars,
2024   Thou euer, yong, fresh, loued, and delicate wooer,
2025   Whose blush doth thawe the consecrated Snow
2026   That lyes on Dians lap.
2027   Thou visible God,
2028   That souldrest close Impossibilities,
2029  *And mak'st them kisse; that speak'st with euerie Tongue
      <P hh3v>
2030   To euerie purpose: O thou touch of hearts,
2031   Thinke thy slaue- man rebels, and by thy vertue
2032   Set them into confounding oddes, that Beasts
2033   May haue the world in Empire.
2034   <S {Ape}.> Would 'twere so,
2035   But not till I am dead. Ile say th'hast Gold:
2036   Thou wilt be throng'd #too shortly.
2037   <S {Tim}.> Throng'd #too?
2038   <S {Ape}.> #I.
2039   <S {Tim}.> Thy backe I prythee.
2040   <S {Ape}.> Liue, and loue thy misery.
2041   <S {Tim}.> Long liue so, and so dye. I am quit.
2042   <S {Ape}.> Mo things like men,
2043   Eate {Timon}, and abhorre then.  <D {Exit Apeman[tus]}.>
2044   <D {Enter the Bandetti}.>
2045  *<S 1> Where should he haue this Gold? It is some poore
2046  *Fragment, some slender Ort of his remainder: the meere
2047  *want of Gold, and the falling from of his Friendes, droue
2048   him into this Melancholly.
2049   <S 2> It is nois'd
2050   He hath a masse of Treasure.
2051  *<S 3> Let vs make the assay vpon him, if he care not for't,
2052  *he will supply vs easily: if he couetously reserue it, how
2053   shall's get it?
2054   <S 2> True: for he beares it not about him:
2055   'Tis hid.
2056   <S 1> Is not this hee?
2057   <S {All}.> Where?
2058   <S 2> 'Tis his description.
2059   <S 3> He? I know him.
2060   <S {All}.> Saue thee {Timon}.
2061   <S {Tim}.> Now Theeues.
2062   <S {All}.> Soldiers, not Theeues.
2063   <S {Tim}.> Both too, and womens Sonnes.
2064   <S {All}.> We are not Theeues, but men
2065   That much do want.
2066  *<S {Tim}.> Your greatest want is, you want much of meat:
2067  *Why should you want? Behold, the Earth hath Rootes:
2068   Within this Mile breake forth a hundred Springs:
2069   The Oakes beare Mast, the Briars Scarlet Heps,
2070   The bounteous Huswife Nature, on each bush,
2071   Layes her full Messe before you. Want? why Want?
2072   <S 1> We cannot liue on Grasse, on Berries, Water,
2073   As Beasts, and Birds, and Fishes.
2074  *<S {Ti}.> Nor on the Beasts themselues, the Birds & Fishes,
2075   You must eate men. Yet thankes I must you con,
2076   That you are Theeues profest: that you worke not
2077   In holier shapes: For there is boundlesse Theft
2078   In limited Professions. Rascall Theeues
2079   Heere's Gold. Go, sucke the subtle blood o'th' Grape,
2080   Till the high Feauor seeth your blood to froth,
2081   And so scape hanging. Trust not the Physitian,
2082   His Antidotes are poyson, and he slayes
2083   Moe then you Rob: Take wealth, and liues together,
2084   Do Villaine do, since you protest to doo't.
2085   Like Workemen, Ile example you with Theeuery:
2086   The Sunnes a Theefe, and with his great attraction
2087   Robbes the vaste Sea. The Moones an arrant Theefe,
2088   And her pale fire, she snatches from the Sunne.
2089   The Seas a Theefe, whose liquid Surge, resolues
2090   The Moone into Salt teares. The Earth's a Theefe,
2091   That feeds and breeds by a composture stolne
2092   From gen'rall excrement: each thing's a Theefe.
2093  *The Lawes, your curbe and whip, in their rough power
2094   Ha's vncheck'd Theft. Loue not your selues, away,
2095   Rob one another, there's more Gold, cut throates,
2096   All that you meete are Theeues: to Athens go,
2097   Breake open shoppes, nothing can you steale
2098   But Theeues do loose it: steale lesse, for this I giue you,
2099   And Gold confound you howsoere: Amen.
      <A M>
2100  *<S 3> #Has almost charm'd me from my Profession, by per-swading
2101   me to it.
2102  *<S 1> 'Tis in the malice of mankinde, that he thus aduises
2103   vs not to haue vs thriue in our mystery.
2104   <S 2> Ile beleeue him as an Enemy,
2105   And giue ouer my Trade.
2106  *<S 1> Let vs first see peace in Athens, there is no time so
2107   miserable, but a man may be true.  <D {Exit Theeues}.>
2108   <D {Enter the Steward to Timon}.>
2109   <S {Stew}.> Oh you Gods!
2110   Is yon'd despis'd and ruinous man my Lord?
2111   Full of decay and fayling? Oh Monument
2112   And wonder of good deeds, euilly bestow'd!
2113   What an alteration of Honor has desp'rate want made?
2114   What vilder thing vpon the earth, then Friends,
2115   Who can bring Noblest mindes, to basest ends.
2116   How rarely does it meete with this times guise,
2117   When man was wisht to loue his Enemies:
2118   Grant I may euer loue, and rather woo
2119   Those that would mischeefe me, then those that doo.
2120  *#Has caught me in his eye, I will present my honest griefe
2121   vnto him; and as my Lord, still serue him with my life.
2122   My deerest Master.
2123   <S {Tim}.> Away: what art thou?
2124   <S {Stew}.> Haue you forgot me, Sir?
2125   <S {Tim}.> Why dost aske that? I haue forgot all men.
2126   Then, if thou grunt'st, th'art a man.
2127   I haue forgot thee.
2128   <S {Stew}.> An honest poore seruant of yours.
2129   <S {Tim}.> Then I know thee not:
2130   I neuer had honest man about me, I all
2131   I kept were Knaues, to serue in meate to Villaines.
2132   <S {Stew}.> The Gods are witnesse,
2133   Neu'r did poore Steward weare a truer greefe
2134   For his vndone Lord, then mine eyes for you.
2135   <S {Tim}.> What, dost thou weepe?
2136   Come neerer, then I loue thee
2137   Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
2138   Flinty mankinde: whose eyes do neuer giue,
2139   But thorow Lust and Laughter: pittie's sleeping:
2140  *Strange times y weepe with laughing, not with weeping.
2141   <S {Stew}.> I begge of you to know me, good my Lord,
2142   T' accept my greefe, and whil'st this poore wealth lasts,
2143   To entertaine me as your Steward still.
2144   <S {Tim}.> Had I a Steward
2145   So true, so iust, and now so comfortable?
2146   It almost turnes my dangerous Nature wilde.
2147   Let me behold thy face: Surely, this man
2148   Was borne of woman.
2149   Forgiue my generall, and exceptlesse rashnesse
2150   You perpetuall sober Gods. I do proclaime
2151   One honest man: Mistake me not, but one:
2152   No more I pray, and hee's a Steward.
2153   How faine would I haue hated all mankinde,
2154   And thou redeem'st thy selfe. But all saue thee,
2155   I fell with Curses.
2156   Me  thinkes thou art more honest now, then wise:
2157   For, by oppressing and betraying mee,
      <P hh4>
2158   Thou might'st haue sooner got another Seruice:
2159   For many so arriue at second Masters,
2160   Vpon their first Lords necke. But tell me true,
2161   (For I must euer doubt, though ne're so sure)
2162   Is not thy kindnesse subtle, couetous,
2163   If not a Vsuring kindnesse, and as rich men deale Guifts,
2164   Expecting in returne twenty for one?
2165   <S {Stew}.> No my most worthy Master, in whose brest
2166   Doubt, and suspect (alas) are plac'd too late:
2167   You should haue fear'd false times, when you did Feast.
2168   Suspect still comes, where an estate is least.
2169   That which I shew, Heauen knowes, is meerely Loue,
2170   Dutie, and Zeale, to your vnmatched minde;
2171   Care of your Food and Liuing, and beleeue it,
2172   My most Honour'd Lord,
2173   For any benefit that points to mee,
2174   Either in hope, or present, I'de exchange
2175   For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
2176   To requite me, by making rich your selfe.
2177   <S {Tim}.> Looke thee, 'tis so: thou singly honest man,
2178   Heere take: the Gods out of my miserie
2179   Ha's sent thee Treasure. Go, liue rich and happy,
2180   But thus condition'd: Thou shalt build from men:
2181   Hate all, curse all, shew Charity to none,
2182   But let the famisht flesh slide from the Bone,
2183   Ere thou releeue the Begger. Giue to dogges
2184   What thou denyest to men. Let Prisons swallow 'em,
2185  *Debts wither 'em to nothing, be men like blasted woods
2186   And may Diseases licke vp their false bloods,
2187   And so farewell, and thriue.
2188   <S {Stew}.> O let me stay, and comfort you, my Master.
2189   <S {Tim}.> If thou hat'st Curses
2190   Stay not: flye, whil'st thou art blest and free:
2191   Ne're see thou man, and let me ne're see thee. <D {Exit}>
      <A S>
2192   <D {Enter Poet, and Painter}.>
2193  *<S {Pain}.> As I tooke note of the place, it cannot be farre
2194   where he abides.
2195   <S {Poet}.> What's to be thought of him?
2196   Does the Rumor hold for true,
2197   That hee's so full of Gold?
2198   <S {Painter}.> Certaine.
2199   {Alcibiades} reports it: {Phrinica} and {Timandylo}
2200   Had Gold of him. He likewise enrich'd
2201   Poore stragling Souldiers, with great quantity.
2202   'Tis saide, he gaue vnto his Steward
2203   A mighty summe.
2204   <S {Poet}.> Then this breaking of his,
2205   Ha's beene but a Try for his Friends?
2206   <S {Painter}.> Nothing else:
2207   You shall see him a Palme in Athens againe,
2208   And flourish with the highest:
2209   Therefore, 'tis not amisse, we tender our loues
2210   To him, in this suppos'd distresse of his:
2211   It will shew honestly in vs,
2212   And is very likely, to loade our purposes
2213   With what they trauaile for,
2214   If it be a iust and true report, that goes
2215   Of his #hauing.
2216   <S {Poet}.> What haue you now
2217   To present vnto him?
2218   <S {Painter}.> Nothing at this time
2219   But my Visitation: onely I will promise him
2220   An excellent Peece.
2221   <S {Poet}.> I must serue him so too;
2222   Tell him of an intent that's comming toward him.
2223   <S {Painter}.> Good as the best.
2224   Promising, is the verie Ayre o'th' Time;
2225   It opens the eyes of Expectation.
2226   Performance, is euer the duller for his acte,
2227   And but in the plainer and simpler kinde of people,
2228   The deede of Saying is quite out of vse.
2229   To Promise, is most Courtly and fashionable;
2230   Performance, is a kinde of #Will or Testament
2231   Which argues a great sicknesse in his iudgement
2232   That makes it.

2234   <S {Timon}.> Excellent Workeman,
2235   Thou canst not paint a man so badde
2236   As is thy selfe.
2237   <S {Poet}.> I am thinking
2238   What I shall say I haue prouided for him:
2239   It must be a personating of himselfe:
2240   A Satyre against the softnesse of Prosperity,
2241   With a Discouerie of the infinite Flatteries
2242   That follow youth and opulencie.
2243   <S {Timon}.> Must thou needes
2244   Stand for a Villaine in thine owne Worke?
2245   Wilt thou whip thine owne faults in other men?
2246   Do so, I haue Gold for thee.
2247   <S {Poet}.> Nay let's seeke him.
2248   Then do we sinne against our owne estate,
2249   When we may profit meete, and come too late.
2250   <S {Painter}.> True:
2251   When the day serues before blacke- corner'd night;
2252   Finde what thou want'st, by free and offer'd light.
2253   Come.
2254   <S {Tim}.> Ile meete you at the turne:
2255   What a Gods Gold, that he is worshipt
2256   In a baser Temple, then where Swine feede?
2257   'Tis thou that rigg'st the Barke, and plow'st the Fome,
2258   Setlest admired reuerence in a Slaue,
2259   To thee be worshipt, and thy Saints for aye:
2260   Be crown'd with Plagues, that thee alone obay.
2261   Fit I meet them.
2262   <S {Poet}.> Haile worthy {Timon}.
2263   <S {Pain}.> Our late Noble Master.
2264   <S {Timon}.> Haue I once liu'd
2265   To see two honest men?
2266   <S {Poet}.> Sir:
2267   Hauing often of your open Bounty tasted,
2268   Hearing you were retyr'd, your Friends falne off,
2269   Whose thankelesse Natures (O abhorred Spirits)
2270   Not all the Whippes of Heauen, are large enough.
2271   What, to you,
2272   Whose Starre- like Noblenesse gaue life and influence
2273   To their whole being? I am rapt, and cannot couet
2274   The monstrous bulke of this Ingratitude
2275   With any size of words.
2276   <S {Timon}.> Let it go,
2277   Naked men may see't the better:
2278   You that are honest, by being what you are,
2279   Make them best seene, and knowne.
2280   <S {Pain}.> He, and my selfe
2281   Haue trauail'd in the great showre of your guifts,
2282   And sweetly felt it.
2283   <S {Timon}.> #I, you are honest man.
2284   <S {Painter}.> We are hither come
2285   To offer you our seruice.
2286   <S {Timon}.> Most honest men:
      <P hh4v>
2287   Why how shall I requite you?
2288   Can you eate Roots, and drinke cold water, no?
2289   <S {Both}.> What we can do,
2290   Wee'l do to do you seruice.
2291   <S {Tim}.> Y'are honest men,
2292   Y'haue heard that I haue Gold,
2293   I am sure you haue, speake truth, y'are honest men.
2294   <S {Pain}.> So it is said my Noble Lord, but therefore
2295   Came not my Friend, nor I.
2296  *<S {Timon}.> Good honest men: Thou draw'st a counterfet
2297   Best in all Athens, th'art indeed the best,
2298   Thou counterfet'st most liuely.
2299   <S {Pain}.> So, so, my Lord.
2300   <S {Tim}.> E'ne so sir as I say. And for thy fiction,
2301   Why thy Verse swels with stuffe so fine and smooth,
2302   That thou art euen Naturall in thine #Art.
2303   But for all this (my honest Natur'd friends)
2304   I must needs say you haue a little fault,
2305   Marry 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
2306   You take much paines to mend.
2307   <S {Both}.> Beseech your Honour
2308   To make it knowne to vs.
2309   <S {Tim}.> You'l take it #ill.
2310   <S {Both}.> Most thankefully, my Lord.
2311   <S {Timon}.> Will you indeed?
2312   <S {Both}.> Doubt it not worthy Lord.
2313   <S {Tim}.> There's neuer a one of you but trusts a Knaue,
2314   That mightily deceiues you.
2315   <S {Both}.> Do we, my Lord?
2316   <S {Tim}.> #I, and you heare him cogge,
2317   See him dissemble,
2318   Know his grosse patchery, loue him, feede him,
2319   Keepe in your bosome, yet remaine assur'd
2320   That he's a made- vp- Villaine.
2321   <S {Pain}.> I know none such, my Lord.
2322   <S {Poet}.> Nor I.
2323   <S {Timon}.> Looke you,
2324   I loue you well, Ile giue you Gold
2325   Rid me these Villaines from your companies;
2326   Hang them, or stab them, drowne them in a draught,
2327   Confound them by some course, and come to me,
2328   Ile giue you Gold enough.
2329   <S {Both}.> Name them my Lord, let's know them.
2330   <S {Tim}.> You that way, and you this:
2331   But two in Company:
2332   Each man #a part, all single, and alone,
2333   Yet an arch Villaine keepes him company:
2334   If where thou art, two Villaines shall not be,
2335   Come not neere him. If thou would'st not recide
2336   But where one Villaine is, then him abandon.
2337  *Hence, packe, there's Gold, you came for Gold ye slaues:
2338   You haue worke for me; there's payment, hence,
2339   You are an Alcumist, make Gold of that:
2340   Out Rascall dogges.  <D {Exeunt}>
2341   <D {Enter Steward, and two Senators}.>
2342  *<S {Stew}.> It is vaine that you would speake with {Timon}:
2343   For he is set so onely to himselfe,
2344   That nothing but himselfe, which lookes like man,
2345   Is friendly with him.
2346   <S 1.{Sen}.> Bring vs to his Caue.
2347   It is our part and promise to th' Athenians
2348   To speake with {Timon}.
2349   <S 2.{Sen}.> At all times alike
2350   Men are not still the same: 'twas Time and Greefes
2351   That fram'd him thus. Time with his fairer hand,
2352   Offering the Fortunes of his former dayes,
2353   The former man may make him: bring vs to him
2354   And chanc'd it as it may.
2355   <S {Stew}.> Heere is his Caue:
2356   Peace and content be heere. Lord {Timon}, {Timon},
2357   Looke out, and speake to Friends: Th' Athenians
2358   By two of their most reuerend Senate greet thee:
2359   Speake to them Noble {Timon}.
2360   <D {Enter Timon out of his Caue}.>
2361   <S {Tim}.> Thou Sunne that comforts burne,
2362   Speake and be hang'd:
2363   For each true word, a blister, and each false
2364   Be as a Cantherizing to the root o'th' Tongue,
2365   Consuming it with speaking.
2366   <S 1> Worthy {Timon}.
2367   <S {Tim}.> Of none but such as you,
2368   And you of {Timon}.
2369   <S 1> The Senators of Athens, greet thee {Timon}.
2370   <S {Tim}.> I thanke them,
2371   And would send them backe the plague,
2372   Could I but catch it for them.
2373   <S 1> O forget
2374   What we are sorry for our selues in thee:
2375   The Senators, with one consent of loue,
2376   Intreate thee backe to Athens, who haue thought
2377   On speciall Dignities, which vacant lye
2378   For thy best vse and wearing.
2379   <S 2> They confesse
2380   Toward thee, forgetfulnesse too generall grosse;
2381   Which now the publike Body, which doth sildome
2382   Play the re-canter, feeling in it selfe
2383   A lacke of {Timons} ayde, hath since withall
2384   Of it owne fall, restraining ayde to {Timon},
2385   And send forth vs, to make their sorrowed render,
2386   Together, with a recompence more fruitfull
2387   Then their offence can weigh downe by the Dramme,
2388   #I euen such heapes and summes of Loue and Wealth,
2389   As shall to thee blot out, what wrongs were theirs,
2390   And write in thee the figures of their loue,
2391   Euer to read them thine.
2392   <S {Tim}.> You witch me in it;
2393   Surprize me to the very brinke of teares;
2394   Lend me a Fooles heart, and a womans eyes,
2395   And Ile beweepe these comforts, worthy Senators.
2396   <S 1> Therefore so please thee to returne with vs,
2397   And of our Athens, thine and ours to take
2398   The Captainship, thou shalt be met with thankes,
2399   Allowed with absolute power, and thy good name
2400   Liue with Authoritie: so soone we shall driue backe
2401   Of {Alcibiades} th' approaches wild,
2402   Who like a Bore too sauage, doth root vp
2403   His Countries peace.
2404   <S 2> And shakes his threatning Sword
2405   Against the walles of {Athens}.
2406   <S 1> Therefore {Timon}.
2407   <S {Tim}.> Well sir, I will: therefore I will sir thus:
2408   If {Alcibiades} kill my Countrymen,
2409   Let {Alcibiades} know this of {Timon},
2410   That {Timon} cares not. But if he sacke faire Athens,
2411   And take our goodly aged men by'th' Beards,
2412   Giuing our holy Virgins to the staine
2413   Of contumelious, beastly, mad- brain'd warre:
2414   Then let him know, and tell him {Timon} speakes it,
      <P hh5>
2415   In pitty of our aged, and our youth,
2416   I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,
2417   And let him tak't at worst: For their Kniues care not,
2418   While you haue throats to answer. For my selfe,
2419   There's not a whittle, in th' vnruly Campe,
2420   But I do prize it at my loue, before
2421   The reuerends Throat in Athens. So I leaue you
2422   To the protection of the prosperous Gods,
2423   As Theeues to Keepers.
2424   <S {Stew}.> Stay not, all's in vaine.
2425   <S {Tim}.> Why I was writing of my Epitaph,
2426   It will be seene to morrow. My long sicknesse
2427   Of Health, and Liuing, now begins to mend,
2428   And nothing brings me all things. Go, liue still,
2429   Be {Alcibiades} your plague; you his,
2430   And last so long enough.
2431   <S 1> We speake in vaine.
2432   <S {Tim}.> But yet I loue my Country, and am not
2433   One that reioyces in the common wracke,
2434   As common bruite doth put it.
2435   <S 1> That's well spoke.
2436   <S {Tim}.> Commend me to my louing Countreymen.
2437  *<S 1> These words become your lippes as they passe tho-row
2438   them.
2439   <S 2> And enter in our eares, like great Triumphers
2440   In their applauding gates.
2441   <S {Tim}.> Commend me to them,
2442   And tell them, that to ease them of their greefes,
2443   Their feares of Hostile strokes, their Aches losses,
2444   Their pangs of Loue, with other incident throwes
2445   That Natures fragile Vessell doth sustaine
2446  *In lifes vncertaine voyage, I will some kindnes do them,
2447   Ile teach them to preuent wilde {Alcibiades} wrath.
2448   <S 1> I like this well, he will returne againe.
2449  *<S {Tim}.> I haue a Tree which growes heere in my Close,
2450   That mine owne vse inuites me to cut downe,
2451   And shortly must I fell it. Tell my Friends,
2452   Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,
2453   From high to low throughout, that who so please
2454   To stop Affliction, let him take his haste;
2455   Come hither ere my Tree hath felt the Axe,
2456   And hang himselfe. I pray you do my greeting.
2457   <S {Stew}.> Trouble him no further, thus you still shall
2458   Finde him.
2459   <S {Tim}.> Come not to me againe, but say to Athens,
2460   {#Timon} hath made his euerlasting Mansion
2461   Vpon the Beached Verge of the salt Flood,
2462   Who once a day with his embossed Froth
2463   The turbulent Surge shall couer; thither come,
2464   And let my graue- stone be your Oracle:
2465   Lippes, let foure words go by, and Language end:
2466   What is amisse, Plague and Infection mend.
2467   Graues onely be mens workes, and Death their gaine;
2468   Sunne, hide thy Beames, {Timon} hath done his Raigne.
2469   <D {Exit Timon}.>
2470  *<S 1> His discontents are vnremoueably coupled to Na-ture.
2471  _
2472   <S 2> Our hope in him is dead: let vs returne,
2473   And straine what other meanes is left vnto vs
2474   In our deere perill.
2475   <S 1> It requires swift foot.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2476   <D {Enter two other Senators, with a Messenger}.>
2477   <S 1> Thou hast painfully discouer'd: are his Files
2478   As full as thy report?
2479   <S {Mes}.> I haue spoke the least.
2480   Besides his expedition promises present approach.
2481   <S 2> We stand much hazard, if they bring not {Timon}.
2482   <S {Mes}.> I met a Currier, one mine ancient Friend,
2483   Whom though in generall part we were oppos'd,
2484   Yet our old loue made a particular force,
2485   And made vs speake like Friends. This man was riding
2486   From {Alcibiades} to {Timons} Caue,
2487   With Letters of intreaty, which imported
2488   His Fellowship i'th' cause against your City,
2489   In part for his sake mou'd.
2490   <D {Enter the other Senators}.>
2491   <S 1> Heere come our Brothers.
2492   <S 3> No talke of {Timon}, nothing of him expect,
2493   The Enemies Drumme is heard, and fearefull scouring
2494   Doth choake the ayre with dust: In, and prepare,
2495   Ours is the fall I feare, our Foes the Snare.  <D {Exeunt}>
2496   <D {Enter a Souldier in the Woods, seeking Timon}.>
2497   <S {Sol}.> By all description this should be the place.
2498   Whose heere? Speake hoa. No answer? What is this?
2499   {Tymon} is dead, who hath out- stretcht his span,
2500   Some Beast reade this; There do's not liue a Man.
2501   Dead sure, and #this his Graue, what's on this Tomb,
2502   I cannot read: the Charracter Ile take with wax,
2503   Our Captaine hath in euery Figure skill;
2504   An ag'd Interpreter, though yong in dayes:
2505   Before proud Athens hee's set downe by this,
2506   Whose fall the marke of his Ambition is.  <D {Exit}.>
2507   <D {Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his Powers}
2508   {before Athens}.>
2509   <S {Alc}.> Sound to this Coward, and lasciuious Towne,
2510   Our terrible approach.
2511   <D {Sounds a Parly}.>
2512   <D {The Senators appeare vpon the wals}.>
2513   Till now you haue gone on, and fill'd the time
2514   With all Licentious measure, making your willes
2515   The scope of Iustice. Till now, my selfe and such
2516   As slept within the shadow of your power
2517   Haue wander'd with our trauerst Armes, and breath'd
2518   Our sufferance vainly: Now the time is flush,
2519   When crouching Marrow in the bearer strong
2520   Cries (of it selfe) no more: Now breathlesse wrong,
2521   Shall sit and pant in your great Chaires of ease,
2522   And pursie Insolence shall breake his winde
2523   With feare and horrid flight.
2524   <S 1.{Sen}.> Noble, and young;
2525   When thy first greefes were but a meere conceit,
2526   Ere thou had'st power, or we had cause of feare,
2527   We sent to thee, to giue thy rages Balme,
2528   To wipe out our Ingratitude, with Loues
2529   Aboue their quantitie.
2530   <S 2> So did we wooe
2531   Transformed {Timon}, to our Citties loue
2532   By humble Message, and by promist meanes:
2533   We were not all vnkinde, nor all deserue
2534   The common stroke of warre.
2535   <S 1> These walles of ours,
2536   Were not erected by their hands, from whom
2537   You haue receyu'd your greefe: Nor are they such,
2538  *That these great Towres, Trophees, & Schools shold fall
2539   For priuate faults in them.
2540   <S 2> Nor are they liuing
      <P hh5v>
2541   Who were the motiues that you first went out,
2542   (Shame that they wanted, cunning in excesse)
2543   Hath broke their hearts. March, Noble Lord,
2544   Into our City with thy Banners spred,
2545   By decimation and a tythed death;
2546   If thy Reuenges hunger for that Food
2547   Which Nature loathes, take thou the destin'd tenth,
2548   And by the hazard of the spotted dye,
2549   Let dye the spotted.
2550   <S 1> All haue not offended:
2551   For those that were, it is not square to take
2552   On those that are, Reuenge: Crimes, like Lands
2553   Are not inherited, then deere Countryman,
2554   Bring in thy rankes, but leaue without thy rage,
2555   Spare thy Athenian Cradle, and those Kin
2556   Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
2557   With those that haue offended, like a Shepheard,
2558   Approach the Fold, and cull th' infected forth,
2559   But kill not altogether.
2560   <S 2> What thou wilt,
2561   Thou rather shalt inforce it with thy smile,
2562   Then hew too't, with thy Sword.
2563   <S 1> Set but thy foot
2564   Against our rampyr'd gates, and they shall ope:
2565   So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
2566   To say thou't enter Friendly.
2567   <S 2> Throw thy Gloue,
2568   Or any Token of thine Honour else,
2569   That thou wilt vse the warres as thy redresse,
2570   And not as our Confusion: All thy Powers
2571   Shall make their harbour in our Towne, till wee
2572   Haue seal'd thy full desire.
2573   <S {Alc}.> Then there's my Gloue,
2574   Defend and open your vncharged Ports,
2575   Those Enemies of {Timons}, and mine owne
2576   Whom you your selues shall set out for reproofe,
2577   Fall and no more; and to attone your feares
2578   With my more Noble meaning, not a man
2579   Shall passe his quarter, or offend the streame
2580   Of Regular Iustice in your Citties bounds,
2581   But shall be remedied to your publique Lawes
2582   At heauiest answer.
2583   <S {Both}.> 'Tis most Nobly spoken.
2584   <S {Alc}.> Descend, and keepe your words.
2585   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2586   <S {Mes}.> My Noble Generall, {Timon} is dead,
2587   Entomb'd vpon the very hemme o'th' Sea,
2588   And on his Grauestone, this Insculpture which
2589   With wax I brought away: whose soft Impression
2590   Interprets for my poore ignorance.
2591   <D {Alcibiades reades the Epitaph}.>
2592   {Heere lies a wretched Coarse, of wretched Soule bereft},
2593  *{Seek not my name: A Plague consume you, wicked Caitifs left}:
2594   {Heere lye I Timon, who aliue, all liuing men did hate},
2595  *{Passe by, and curse thy fill, but passe and stay not here thy gate}.
2596   These well expresse in thee thy latter spirits:
2597   Though thou abhorrd'st in vs our humane griefes,
2598  *Scornd'st our Braines flow, and those our droplets, which
2599   From niggard Nature fall; yet Rich Conceit
2600   Taught thee to make vast Neptune weepe for aye
2601   On thy low Graue, on faults forgiuen. Dead
2602   Is Noble {Timon}, of whose Memorie
2603   Heereafter more. Bring me into your Citie,
2604   And I will vse the Oliue, with my Sword:
2605  *Make war breed peace; make peace stint war, make each
2606   Prescribe to other, as each others Leach.
2607   Let our Drummes strike.  <D {Exeunt}.>
