1      <Z {Actus  Primus. Scoena Prima}.>
2      <D {Enter Rodorigo, and Iago}.>
3      <S {Rodorigo}.>
4      Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly
5      That thou ({Iago}) who hast had my purse,
6     *As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this.
7     *<S {Ia}.> But you'l not heare me. If euer I did dream
8      Of such a matter, abhorre me.
9      <S {Rodo}.> Thou told'st me,
10     Thou did'st hold him in thy hate.
11     <S {Iago}.> Despise me
12     If I do not. Three Great- ones of the Cittie,
13     (In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant)
14     Off- capt to him: and by the faith of man
15     I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.
16     But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes)
17     Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance,
18     Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre,
19     Non- suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he,
20     I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he?
21     For- sooth, a great Arithmatician,
22     One {Michaell Cassio}, a {Florentine},
23     (A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife)
24     That neuer set a Squadron in the Field,
25     Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes
26    *More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke:
27     Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
28     As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)
29     Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;
30     And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe
31     At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds
32     Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be- leed, and calm'd
33     By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter- caster,
34     He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be,
35     And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient.
36    *<S {Rod}.> By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman.
37     <S {Iago}.> Why, there's no remedie.
38     'Tis the cursse of Seruice;
39     Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,
40     And not by old gradation, where each second
41     Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,
42     Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd
43     To loue the {Moore}?
44     <S {Rod}.> I would not follow him then.
45     <S {Iago}.> O Sir content you.
46     I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.
47     We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters
48     Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke
49     Many a dutious and knee- crooking knaue;
50     That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)
51     Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,
52    *For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd.
53     Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are
54     Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,
55     Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,
56     And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
57     Doe well thriue by them.
58     And when they haue lin'd their Coates
59     Doe themselues Homage.
60     These Fellowes haue some soule,
61     And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)
62     It is as sure as you are {Rodorigo},
63     Were I the Moore, I would not be {Iago}:
64     In following him, I follow but my selfe.
65     Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,
66     But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
67     For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
68     The natiue act, and figure of my heart
69     In Complement externe, 'tis not long after
70     But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
71     For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am.
72     <S {Rod}.> What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks- lips owe
73     If he can carry't thus?
74     <S {Iago}.> Call vp her Father:
75     Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight,
76     Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,
77     And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,
78     Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,
79     Yet throw such chances of vexation on't,
80     As it may loose some colour.
81     <S {Rodo}.> Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud.
82     <S {Iago}.> Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell,
83     As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire
84     Is spied in populus Citties.
85     <S {Rodo}.> What hoa: {Brabantio}, Signior {Brabantio}, hoa.
86    *<S {Iago}.> Awake: what hoa, {Brabantio}: Theeues, Theeues.
87     Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags,
88     Theeues, Theeues.
89     <S {Bra}. {Aboue}.> What is the reason of this terrible
90     Summons? What is the matter there?
91     <S {Rodo}.> Signior is all your Familie within?
92     <S {Iago}.> Are your Doores lock'd?
93     <S {Bra}.> Why? Wherefore ask you this?
94    *<S {Iago}.> Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,
      <P ss4>
95     Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule
96     Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram
97     Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,
98     Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,
99     Or else the deuill will make a Grand- sire of you.
100    Arise I say.
101    <S {Bra}.> What, haue you lost your wits?
102   *<S {Rod}.> Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice?
103    <S {Bra}.> Not I: what are you?
104    <S {Rod}.> My name is {Rodorigo}.
105    <S {Bra}.> The worsser welcome:
106    I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:
107    In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,
108    My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse
109    (Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)
110    Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come
111    To start my quiet.
112    <S {Rod}.> Sir, Sir, Sir.
113    <S {Bra}.> But thou must needs be sure,
114    My spirits and my place haue in their power
115    To make this bitter to thee.
116    <S {Rodo}.> Patience good Sir.
117    <S {Bra}.> What tell'st thou me of Robbing?
118    This is Venice: my house is not a Grange.
119    <S {Rodo}.> Most graue {Brabantio},
120    In simple and pure soule, I come to you.
121   *<S {Ia}.> Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,
122   *if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,
123   *and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daugh-ter
124   *couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Ne-phewes
125   *neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:
126    and Gennets for Germaines.
127    <S {Bra}.> What prophane wretch art thou?
128   *<S {Ia}.> I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daugh-ter
129   *and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs.
130    <S {Bra}.> Thou art a Villaine.
131    <S {Iago}.> You are a Senator.
132   *<S {Bra}.> This thou shalt answere. I know thee {Rodorigo}.
133   *<S {Rod}.> Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you
134    If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,
135    (As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,
136    At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night
137    Transported with no worse nor better guard,
138    But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,
139    To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:
140    If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,
141    We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.
142    But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,
143    We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue
144    That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,
145    I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.
146    Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)
147    I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,
148    Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes
149    In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,
150    Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.
151    If she be in her Chamber, or your house,
152    Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
153    For thus deluding you.
154    <S {Bra}.> Strike on the Tinder, hoa:
155    Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,
156    This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,
157    Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.
158    Light, I say, light.  <D {Exit}.>
159    <S {Iag}.> Farewell: for I must leaue you.
160    It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place
161    To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)
162    Against the Moore. For I do know the State,
163    (How euer this may gall him with some checke)
164    Cannot with safetie cast- him. For he's embark'd
165    With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,
166    (Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules
167    Another of his Fadome, they haue none,
168    To lead their Businesse. In which regard,
169    Though I do hate him as I do #hell paines,
170    Yet, for necessitie of present life,
171    I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,
172   *(Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him
173    Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:
174    And there will I be with him. So farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
175    <D {Enter Brabantio, with Seruants and Torches}.>
176    <S {Bra}.> It is too true an euill. Gone she is,
177    And what's to come of my despised time,
178    Is naught but bitternesse. Now {Rodorigo},
179    Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle)
180   *With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)
181    How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me
182    Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers.
183    Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you?
184    <S {Rodo}.> Truely I thinke they are.
185    <S {Bra}.> Oh Heauen: how got she out?
186    Oh treason of the blood.
187    Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds
188    By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes,
189    By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood
190    May be abus'd? Haue you not read {Rodorigo},
191    Of some such thing?
192    <S {Rod}.> Yes Sir: I haue indeed.
193   *<S {Bra}.> Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her.
194    Some one way, some another. Doe you know
195    Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore?
196    <S {Rod}.> I thinke I can discouer him, if you please
197    To get good Guard, and go along with me.
198    <S {Bra}.> Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call,
199    (I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa)
200    And raise some speciall Officers of #might:
201    On good {Rodorigo}, I will deserue your paines.  <D {Exeunt}.>
202    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
203    <D {Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches}.>
204   *<S {Ia}.> Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men,
205    Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience
206    To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie
207    Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times
208    I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes.
209    <S {Othello}.> 'Tis better as it is.
210    <S {Iago}.> Nay but he prated,
211    And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes
212   *Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue
213    I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,
214    Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,
215    That the Magnifico is much belou'd,
216    And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
217    As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.
218    Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,
      <P ss4v>
219    The Law (with all his #might, to enforce it on)
220    Will giue him Cable.
221    <S {Othel}.> Let him do his spight;
222    My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie
223    Shall out- tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,
224    Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour,
225    I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,
226    From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites
227    May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune
228    As this that I haue reach'd. For know {Iago},
229    But that I loue the gentle {Desdemona},
230    I would not my vnhoused free condition
231    Put into Circumscription, and Confine,
232   *For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond?
233    <D {Enter Cassio, with Torches}.>
234    <S {Iago}.> Those are the raised Father, and his Friends:
235    You were best go in.
236    <S {Othel}.> Not I: I must be found.
237    My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule
238    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
239    <S {Iago}.> By {Ianus}, I thinke no.
240    <S {Othel}.> The Seruants of the Dukes?
241    And my Lieutenant?
242    The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)
243    What is the Newes?
244    <S {Cassio}.> The Duke do's greet you (Generall)
245    And he requires your haste, Post- haste appearance,
246    Euen on the instant.
247    <S {Othello}.> What is the matter, thinke you?
248    <S {Cassio}.> Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:
249    It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies
250    Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
251    This very night, at one anothers heeles:
252    And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,
253   *Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for,
254    When being not at your Lodging to be found,
255    The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests,
256    To search you out.
257    <S {Othel}.> 'Tis well I am found by you:
258    I will but spend a word here in the house,
259    And goe with you.
260    <S {Cassio}.> Aunciant, what makes he heere?
261   *<S {Iago}.> Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract,
262    If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer.
263    <S {Cassio}.> I do not vnderstand.
264    <S {Iago}.> He's married.
265    <S {Cassio}.> To who?
266    <S {Iago}.> Marry to=== Come Captaine, will you go?
267    <S {Othel}.> Haue with you.
268   *<S {Cassio}.> Here comes another Troope to seeke for you.
269    <D {Enter Brabantio, Rodorigo, with Officers, and Torches}.>
270    <S {Iago}.> It is {Brabantio}: Generall be aduis'd,
271    He comes to bad intent.
272    <S {Othello}.> Holla, stand there.
273    <S {Rodo}.> Signior, it is the Moore.
274    <S {Bra}.> Downe with him, Theefe.
275    <S {Iago}.> You, {Rodorigo}? Come Sir, I am for you.
276   *<S {Othe}.> Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will
277   *rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with
278    yeares, then with your Weapons.
279    <S {Bra}.> Oh thou foule Theefe,
280    Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter?
281    Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her
282    For Ile referre me to all things of sense,
283    (If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)
284    Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,
285    So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd
286    The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,
287    Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)
288    Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,
289    Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?
290    Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,
291    That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,
292    Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,
293    That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,
294    'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;
295    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,
296    For an abuser of the World, a practiser
297    Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;
298    Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist
299    Subdue him, at his perill.
300    <S {Othe}.> Hold your hands
301    Both you of my inclining, and the rest.
302    Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it
303    Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe
304    To answere this your charge?
305    <S {Bra}.> To Prison, till fit time
306    Of Law, and course of direct Session
307    Call thee to answer.
308    <S {Othe}.> What if I do obey?
309    How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,
310    Whose Messengers are heere about my side,
311    Vpon some present businesse of the State,
312    To bring me to him.
313    <S {Officer}.> 'Tis true most worthy Signior,
314    The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,
315    I am sure is sent for.
316    <S {Bra}.> How? The Duke in Counsell?
317    In this time of the night? Bring him away;
318    Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,
319    Or any of my Brothers of the State,
320    Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:
321    For if such Actions may haue passage free,
322   *Bond- slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.  <D {Exeunt}>
323    <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
324    <D {Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers}.>
325    <S {Duke}.> There's no composition in this Newes,
326    That giues them Credite.
327    <S 1.{Sen}.> Indeed, they are disproportioned;
328    My Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies.
329    <S {Duke}.> And mine a Hundred fortie.
330    <S 2.{Sena}.> And mine two Hundred:
331    But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,
332    (As in these Cases where the ayme reports,
333    'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme
334    A Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus.
335    <S {Duke}.> Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:
336    I do not so secure me in the Error,
337    But the maine Article I do approue
338    In fearefull sense.
339    <S {Saylor} {within}.> What hoa, what hoa, what hoa.
340    <D {Enter Saylor}.>
      <P ss5>
341    <S {Officer}.> A Messenger from the Gallies.
342    <S {Duke}.> Now? What's the businesse?
343   *<S {Sailor}.> The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes,
344    So was I bid report here to the State,
345    By Signior {Angelo}.
346    <S {Duke}.> How say you by this change?
347    <S 1.{Sen}.> This cannot be
348    By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant
349    To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider
350    Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;
351    And let our selues againe but vnderstand,
352    That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,
353    So may he with more facile question beare it,
354    For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,
355    But altogether lackes th' abilities
356    That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
357    We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,
358    To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,
359    Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine
360    To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse.
361    <S {Duke}.> Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes.
362    <S {Officer}.> Here is more Newes.
363    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
364    <S {Messen}.> The {Ottamites}, Reueren'd, and Gracious,
365    Steering with due course toward the #Ile of Rhodes,
366    Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete.
367    <S 1.{Sen}.> #I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?
368    <S {Mess}.> Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re- stem
369    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
370    Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior {Montano},
371    Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,
372    With his free dutie, recommends you thus,
373    And prayes you to beleeue him.
374    <S {Duke}.> 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:
375    {Marcus Luccicos} is not he in Towne?
376    <S 1.{Sen}.> He's now in Florence.
377    <S {Duke}.> Write from vs,
378    To him, Post, Post- haste, dispatch.
379   *<S 1.{Sen}.> Here comes {Brabantio}, and the Valiant Moore.
380    <D {Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo},
381    {and Officers}.>
382   *<S {Duke}.> Valiant {Othello}, we must straight employ you,
383    Against the generall Enemy {Ottoman}.
384    I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,
385    We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night.
386    <S {Bra}.> So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.
387    Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse
388   *Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care
389    Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe
390    Is of so flood- gate, and ore- bearing Nature,
391    That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,
392    And it is still it selfe.
393    <S {Duke}.> Why? What's the matter?
394    <S {Bra}.> My Daughter: oh my Daughter!
395    <S {Sen}.> Dead?
396    <S {Bra}.> #I, to me.
397    She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted
398    By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;
399    For Nature, so prepostrously to erre,
400    (Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)
401    Sans witch- craft could not.
402    <S {Duke}.> Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding
403    Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,
404    And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,
405    You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,
406    After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son
407    Stood in your Action.
408    <S {Bra}.> Humbly I thanke your Grace,
409    Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes
410    Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires
411    Hath hither brought.
412    <S {All}.> We are verie sorry for't.
413    <S {Duke}.> What in your owne part, can you say to this?
414    <S {Bra}.> Nothing, but this is so.
415    <S {Othe}.> Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,
416    My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;
417    That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,
418    It is most true: true I haue married her;
419    The verie head, and front of my offending,
420    Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,
421    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;
422    For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,
423    Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd
424    Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:
425    And little of this great world can I speake,
426    More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,
427    And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
428   *In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)
429    I will a round vn- varnish'd Tale deliuer,
430    Of my whole course of Loue.
431    What Drugges, what Charmes,
432    What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,
433    (For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)
434    I won his Daughter.
435    <S {Bra}.> A Maiden, neuer bold:
436    Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion
437    Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,
438    Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing
439    To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;
440    It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.
441    That will confesse Perfection so could erre
442    Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen
443    To find out practises of cunning #hell
444    Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,
445    That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,
446    Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)
447    He wrought vpon  her.
448    To vouch this, is no proofe,
449    Without more wider, and more #ouer Test
450    Then these thin habits, and poore likely- hoods
451    Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him.
452    <S {Sen}.> But {Othello}, speake,
453    Did you, by indirect, and forced courses
454    Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?
455    Or came it by request, and such faire question
456    As soule, to soule affordeth?
457    <S {Othel}.> I do beseech you,
458    Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,
459    And let her speake of me before her Father;
460    If you do finde me foule, in her report,
461    The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,
462    Not onely take away, but let your Sentence
463    Euen fall vpon my life.
464    <S {Duke}.> Fetch {Desdemona} hither.
465    <S {Othe}.> Aunciant, conduct them:
466    You best know the place.
467    And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,
468    I do confesse the vices of my blood,
469    So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present
      <P ss5v>
470    How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,
471    And she in mine.
472    <S {Duke}.> Say it {Othello}.
473    <S {Othe}.> Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:
474    Still question'd me the Storie of my life,
475    From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,
476    That I haue past.
477    I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,
478    Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.
479    Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
480    Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,
481    Of haire- breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
482    Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,
483    And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,
484    And portance in my Trauellours historie.
485    Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,
486   *Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,
487    It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,
488    And of the Canibals that each others eate,
489    The {Antropophague}, and men whose heads
490    Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,
491    Would {Desdemona} seriously incline:
492    But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:
493    Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,
494    She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare
495    Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,
496    Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes
497    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
498    That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,
499    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
500    But not instinctiuely: I did consent,
501    And often did beguile her of her teares,
502    When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
503    That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,
504    She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:
505    She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,
506    'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.
507    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
508   *That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,
509    And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,
510    I should but teach him how to tell my Story,
511    And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,
512    She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,
513    And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.
514    This onely is the witch- craft I haue vs'd.
515    Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.
516    <D {Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants}.>
517   *<S {Duke}.> I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,
518   *Good {Brabantio}, take vp this mangled matter at the best:
519    Men do their broken Weapons rather vse,
520    Then their bare hands.
521    <S {Bra}.> I pray you heare her speake?
522    If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,
523    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
524    Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,
525    Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,
526    Where most you owe obedience?
527    <S {Des}.> My Noble Father,
528    I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.
529    To you I am bound for life, and education:
530    My life and education both do learne me,
531    How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,
532   *I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;
533    And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd
534    To you, preferring you before her Father:
535    So much I challenge, that I may professe
536    Due to the Moore my Lord.
537    <S {Bra}.> God be with you: I haue done.
538    Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;
539    I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.
540    Come hither Moore;
541    I here do giue thee that with all my heart,
542    Which but thou hast already, with all my heart
543    I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)
544    I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,
545    For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
546    To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord.
547    <S {Duke}.> Let me speake like your selfe:
548    And lay a Sentence,
549    Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.
550    When remedies are past, the griefes are ended
551    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
552    To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,
553    Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.
554    What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:
555    Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.
556   *The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,
557    He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe.
558    <S {Bra}.> So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,
559    We loose it not so long as we can smile:
560    He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,
561    But the free comfort which from thence he heares.
562    But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,
563    That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.
564    These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,
565    Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.
566    But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:
567    That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.
568    I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State.
569   *<S {Duke}.> The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
570   *makes for Cyprus: {Othello}, the Fortitude of the place is
571   *best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substi-tute
572   *of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more
573   *soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer
574   *voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber
575   *the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stub-borne,
576    and boystrous expedition.
577    <S {Othe}.> The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,
578    Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
579    My thrice- driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize
580    A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,
581    I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake
582    This present Warres against the {Ottamites}.
583    Most humbly therefore bending to your State,
584    I craue fit disposition for my Wife,
585    Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,
586    With such Accomodation and besort
587    As leuels with her breeding.
588    <S {Duke}.> Why at her Fathers?
589    <S {Bra}.> I will not haue it so.
590    <S {Othe}.> Nor I.
591    <S {Des}.> Nor would I there recide,
592    To put my Father in impatient thoughts
593    By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,
594    To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,
595    And let me finde a Charter in your voice
596    T' assist my simplenesse.
597    <S {Duke}.> What would you {Desdemona}?
598    <S {Des}.> That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,
599    My downe- right violence, and storme of Fortunes,
      <P ss6>
600    May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd
601    Euen to the very quality of my Lord;
602    I saw {Othello's} visage in his mind,
603    And to his Honours and his valiant parts,
604    Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.
605    So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind
606    A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,
607    The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:
608    And I a heauie interim shall support
609    By his deere absence. Let me go with him.
610    <S {Othe}.> Let her haue your voice.
611    Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not
612    To please the pallate of my Appetite:
613    Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
614    In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.
615    But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:
616    And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke
617    I will your serious and great businesse scant
618    When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes
619    Of feather'd {Cupid}, seele with wanton dulnesse
620    My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:
621    That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:
622    Let House- wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,
623    And all indigne, and base aduersities,
624    Make head against my Estimation.
625    <S {Duke}.> Be it as you shall priuately determine,
626    Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries #hast:
627    And speed must answer it.
628    <S {Sen}.> You must away to night.
629    <S {Othe}.> With all my heart.
630   *<S {Duke}.> At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.
631    {#Othello}, leaue some Officer behind
632    And he shall our Commission bring to you:
633    And such things else of qualitie and respect
634    As doth import you.
635    <S {Othe}.> So please your Grace, my Ancient,
636    A man he is of honesty and trust:
637    To his conueyance I assigne my wife,
638    With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think
639    To be sent after me.
640    <S {Duke}.> Let it be so:
641    Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,
642    If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,
643    Your Son- in- law is farre more Faire then Blacke.
644    <S {Sen}.> Adieu braue Moore, vse {Desdemona} well.
645    <S {Bra}.> Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:
646    She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.  <D {Exit}.>
647    <S {Othe}.> My life vpon her faith. Honest {Iago},
648    My {Desdemona} must I leaue to thee:
649    I prythee let thy wife attend on her,
650    And bring them after in the best aduantage.
651    Come {Desdemona}, I haue but an houre
652    Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction
653   *To spend with thee. We must obey the time. <D {Exit}.>
654    <S {Rod}.> {Iago}.
655    <S {Iago}.> What saist thou Noble heart?
656    <S {Rod}.> What will I do, think'st thou?
657    <S {Iago}.> Why go to bed and sleepe.
658    <S {Rod}.> I will incontinently drowne my selfe.
659   *<S {Iago}.> If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
660    thou silly Gentleman?
661   *<S {Rod}.> It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
662   *and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
663    our Physition.
664   *<S {Iago}.> Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
665   *for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
666   *betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
667   *knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
668   *drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
669    change my Humanity with a Baboone.
670   *<S {Rod}.> What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
671    to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it.
672   *<S {Iago}.> Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
673   *thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
674   *our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Net-tels,
675   *or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
676   *Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
677   *many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manu-red
678   *with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable au-thoritie
679   *of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
680   *had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensu-alitie,
681   *the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
682   *conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
683   *haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
684   *Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
685    call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen.
686    <S {Rod}.> It cannot be.
687   *<S {Iago}.> It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
688   *of the #will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
689   *Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
690   *and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
691   *perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
692   *then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
693   *Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
694   *put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that {Desdemona}
695   *should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
696   *thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commence-ment
697   *in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Seque-stration,
698   *put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
699   *are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
700   *The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
701   *shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
702   *must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
703   *she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Mo-ney
704   *in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
705   *it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Mo-ney
706   *thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, be-twixt
707   *an erring Barbarian, and super- subtle Venetian be
708   *not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of #hell, thou
709   *shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drow-ning
710   *thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou ra-ther
711   *to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
712    drown'd, and go without her.
713   *<S {Rodo}.> Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
714    the issue?
715   *<S {Iago}.> Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
716   *told thee often, and I re- tell thee againe, and againe, I
717   *hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
718   *reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
719   *him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
720   *pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
721   *Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
722   *prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to mor-row.
723    Adieu.
724    <S {Rod}.> Where shall we meete i'th' morning?
725    <S {Iago}.> At my Lodging.
726    <S {Rod}.> Ile be with thee betimes.
727    <S {Iago}.> Go #too, farewell. Do you heare {Rodorigo}?
728    <S {Rod}.> Ile sell all my Land.  <D {Exit}.>
729    <S {Iago}.> Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:
730    For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane
731    If I would time expend with such Snipe,
      <P ss6v><C B>
732    But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,
733    And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
734    She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,
735    But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,
736    Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,
737    The better shall my purpose worke on him:
738    {Cassio}'s a proper man: Let me see now,
739    To get his Place, and to plume vp my #will
740    In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.
741    After some time, to abuse {Othello's} eares,
742    That he is too familiar with his wife:
743    He hath a person, and a smooth dispose
744    To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.
745    The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,
746    That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,
747    And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose
748    As Asses are:
749    I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,
750    Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.
751    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
752    <D {Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen}.>
753   *<S {Mon}.> What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?
754    <S 1.{Gent}.> Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:
755    I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,
756    Descry a Saile.
757   *<S {Mon}.> Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,
758    A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:
759    If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,
760    What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,
761    Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?
762    <S 2> A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:
763    For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,
764    The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,
765   *The winde- shak'd- Surge, with high & monstrous Maine
766    Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,
767    And quench the Guards of th' euer- fixed Pole:
768    I neuer did like mollestation view
769    On the enchafed Flood.
770    <S {Men}.> If that the Turkish Fleete
771    Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,
772    It is impossible to beare it out.
773    <D {Enter a Gentleman}.>
774    <S 3> Newes Laddes: our warres are done:
775    The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,
776   *That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,
777    Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance
778    On most part of their Fleet.
779    <S {Mon}.> How? Is this true?
780   *<S 3> The Ship is heere put in: A {Verennessa}, {Michael Cassio}
781    Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, {Othello},
782    Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,
783    And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus.
784    <S {Mon}.> I am glad on't:
785    'Tis a worthy Gouernour.
786   *<S 3> But this same {Cassio}, though he speake of comfort,
787    Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,
788    And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted
789    With fowle and violent Tempest.
790    <S {Mon}.> Pray Heauens he be:
791    For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands
792    Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea- side (hoa)
793    As well to see the Vessell that's come in,
794    As to throw- out our eyes for braue {Othello},
795    Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,
796    An indistinct regard.
797    <S {Gent}.> Come, let's do so;
798    For euery Minute is expectancie
799    Of more Arriuancie.
800    <D {Enter Cassio}.>
801    <S {Cassi}.> Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,
802    That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens
803    Giue him defence against the Elements,
804    For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea.
805    <S {Mon}.> Is he well ship'd?
806    <S {Cassio}.> His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot
807    Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;
808    Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)
809    Stand in bold Cure.
810    <S {Within}.> A Saile, a Saile, a Saile.
811    <S {Cassio}.> What noise?
812    <S {Gent}.> The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea
813    Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile.
814    <S {Cassio}.> My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor.
815    <S {Gent}.> They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,
816    Our Friends, at least.
817    <S {Cassio}.> I pray you Sir, go forth,
818    And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd.
819    <S {Gent}.> I shall.  <D {Exit}.>
820   *<S {Mon}.> But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?
821    <S {Cassio}.> Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid
822    That paragons description, and wilde Fame:
823    One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,
824    And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,
825    Do's tyre the Ingeniuer.
826    <D {Enter Gentleman}.>
827    How now? Who ha's put in?
828    <S {Gent}.> 'Tis one {Iago}, Auncient to the Generall.
829    <S {Cassio}.> #Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:
830    Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,
831    The gutter'd- Rockes, and Congregated Sands,
832    Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,
833    As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit
834    Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by
835    The Diuine {Desdemona}.
836    <S {Mon}.> What is she?
837    <S {Cassio}.> She that I spake of:
838    Our great Captains Captaine,
839    Left in the conduct of the bold {Iago},
840    Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,
841    A Senights speed. Great Ioue, {Othello} guard,
842    And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,
843    That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,
844    Make loues quicke pants in {Desdemonaes} Armes,
845    Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.
846    <D {Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia}.>
847    Oh behold,
848    The Riches of the Ship is come on shore:
849    You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.
850    Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,
851    Before, behinde thee, and on euery hand
852    Enwheele thee round.
853    <S {Des}.> I thanke you, Valiant {Cassio},
854    What tydings can you tell of my Lord?
      <P tt1><C E>
855    <S {Cas}.> He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought
856    But that he's well, and will be shortly heere.
857    <S {Des}.> Oh, but I feare:
858    How lost you company?
859    <S {Cassio}.> The great Contention of Sea, and Skies
860    Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile.
861    <S {Within}.> A Saile, a Saile.
862    <S {Gent}.> They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:
863    This likewise is a Friend.
864    <S {Cassio}.> See for the Newes:
865    Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:
866    Let it not gaule your patience (good {Iago})
867    That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,
868    That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie.
869    <S {Iago}.> Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,
870    As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,
871    You would haue enough.
872    <S {Des}.> Alas: she ha's no speech.
873    <S {Iago}.> Infaith too much:
874    I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.
875    Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,
876    She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
877    And chides with thinking.
878    <S {Aemil}.> You haue little cause to say so.
879   *<S {Iago}.> Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of
880   *doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde- Cats in your Kit-chens:
881   *Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:
882   *Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your
883    Beds.
884    <S {Des}.> Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer.
885    <S {Iago}.> Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,
886    You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.
887    <S {Aemil}.> You shall not write my praise.
888    <S {Iago}.> No, let me not.
889   *<S {Desde}.> What would'st write of me, if thou should'st
890    praise me?
891    <S {Iago}.> Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,
892    For I am nothing, if not Criticall.
893    <S {Des}.> Come on, assay.
894    There's one gone to the Harbour?
895    <S {Iago}.> #I Madam.
896    <S {Des}.> I am not merry: but I do beguile
897    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
898    Come, how would'st thou praise me?
899   *<S {Iago}.> I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes
900   *from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes
901   *out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she
902    is deliuer'd.
903    {If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit},
904    {The ones for vse, the other vseth it}.
905    <S {Des}.> Well prais'd:
906    How if she be Blacke and Witty?
907    <S {Iago}.> {If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit},
908    {She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit}.
909    <S {Des}.> Worse, and worse.
910    <S {Aemil}.> How if Faire, and Foolish?
911    <S {Iago}.> {She neuer yet was foolish that was faire},
912    {For euen her folly helpt her to an heire}.
913   *<S {Desde}.> These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles
914   *laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou
915    for her that's Foule, and Foolish.
916    <S {Iago}.> {There's none so foule and foolish thereunto},
917    {But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise- ones do}.
918   *<S {Desde}.> Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst
919   *best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deser-uing
920   *woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her
921   *merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
922    selfe.
923    <S {Iago}.> {She that was euer faire, and neuer proud},
924    {Had Tongue at #will, and yet was neuer loud:}
925    {Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay},
926    {Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may}.
927    {She that being angred, her reuenge being nie},
928    {Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:}
929    {She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile},
930    {To change the Cods- head for the Salmons taile:}
931    {She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind},
932    {See Suitors following, and not looke behind:}
933    {She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were})
934    <S {Des}.> To do what?
935    <S {Iago}.> {To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere}.
936   *<S {Desde}.> Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do
937   *not learne of him {Aemillia}, though he be thy husband.
938   *How say you ({Cassio}) is he not a most prophane, and li-berall
939    Counsailor?
940   *<S {Cassio}.> He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish
941    him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler.
942   *<S {Iago}.> He takes her by the palme: #I, well said, whis-per.
943   *With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great
944   *a Fly as {Cassio}. #I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee
945   *in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.
946   *If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenan-trie,
947   *it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fin-gers
948   *so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play
949   *the #Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curt-sie:
950   *'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your
951   *lippes? Would they were Cluster- pipes for your
952    sake.
953    The Moore I know his Trumpet.
954    <S {Cassio}.> 'Tis truely so.
955    <S {Des}.> Let's meete him, and recieue him.
956    <S {Cassio}.> Loe, where he comes.
957    <D {Enter Othello, and Attendants}.>
958    <S {Oth}.> O, my faire Warriour.
959    <S {Des}.> My deere {Othello}.
960    <S {Othe}.> It giues me wonder great, as my content
961    To see you heere before me.
962    Oh my Soules Ioy:
963    If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,
964    May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:
965    And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
966    {Olympus} high: and duck againe as low,
967    As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,
968    'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,
969    My Soule hath her content so absolute,
970    That not another comfort like to this,
971    Succeedes in vnknowne Fate.
972    <S {Des}.> The Heauens forbid
973    But that our Loues
974    And Comforts should encrease
975    Euen as our dayes do grow.
976    <S {Othe}.> Amen to that (sweet Powers)
977    I cannot speake enough of this content,
978    It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.
979    And this, and this the greatest discords be
980    That ere our hearts shall make.
981   *<S {Iago}.> Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe
982    the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am.
      <P tt1v>
983    <S {Othe}.> Come: let vs to the Castle.
984    Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:
985    The Turkes are drown'd.
986    How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?
987    (Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,
988   *I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,
989    I prattle out of fashion, and I doate
990    In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good {Iago},
991    Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:
992    Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,
993    He is a good one, and his worthynesse
994    Do's challenge much respect. Come {Desdemona},
995    Once more well met at Cyprus.
996    <D {Exit Othello and Desdemona}.>
997   *<S {Iago}.> Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
998   *Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
999   *being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
1000  *more then is natiue to them) list- me; the Lieutenant to
1001  *night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
1002   thee this: {Desdemona}, is directly in loue with him.
1003   <S {Rod}.> With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
1004  *<S {Iago}.> Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be in-structed.
1005  *Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
1006  *the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
1007  *lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
1008  *heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
1009  *shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
1010  *is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
1011  *game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
1012  *Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
1013  *and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
1014  *for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
1015  *tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue #the,
1016  *gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
1017  *instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
1018  *Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vn-forc'd
1019  *position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
1020  *this Fortune, as {Cassio} do's: a knaue very voluble: no
1021  *further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
1022  *of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
1023  *of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
1024  *why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occa-sion:
1025  *that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Ad-uantages,
1026  *though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
1027  *A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
1028  *and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
1029  *mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
1030   woman hath found him already.
1031  *<S {Rodo}.> I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
1032   bless'd condition.
1033  *<S {Iago}.> Bless'd figges- end. The Wine she drinkes is
1034  *made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
1035  *neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
1036  *not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
1037   marke that?
1038   <S {Rod}.> Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie.
1039  *<S {Iago}>. Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
1040  *prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
1041  *They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
1042  *embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts {Rodorigo}, when
1043  *these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
1044  *comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
1045  *conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
1046  *brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
1047  *the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. {Cassio} knowes you
1048  *not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some oc-casion
1049  *to anger {Cassio}, either by speaking too loud, or
1050  *tainting his discipline, or from what other course
1051  *you please, which the time shall more fauorably mi-nister.
1052  _
1053   <S {Rod}.> Well.
1054  *<S {Iago}.> Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
1055  *happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
1056  *euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
1057  *Whose qualification shall come into no true taste a-gaine,
1058  *but by the displanting of {Cassio}. So shall you
1059  *haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
1060  *shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
1061  *most profitably remoued, without the which there were
1062   no expectation of our prosperitie.
1063  *<S {Rodo}.> I will do this, if you can bring it to any oppor-tunity.
1064  _
1065  *<S {Iago}.> I warrant thee. Meete me #by and by at the
1066  *Cittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries #a Shore. Fare-well.
1067  _
1068   <S {Rodo}.> Adieu.  <D {Exit}.>
1069   <S {Iago}.> That {Cassio} loues her, I do well beleeu't:
1070   That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.
1071   The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)
1072   Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,
1073   And I dare thinke, he'le proue to {Desdemona}
1074   A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,
1075   Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture
1076   I stand accomptant for as great a sin)
1077   But partely led to dyet my Reuenge,
1078   For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
1079   Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,
1080   Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:
1081   And nothing can, or shall content my Soule
1082   Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.
1083   Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,
1084   At least into a Ielouzie so strong
1085   That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
1086   If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace
1087   For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,
1088   Ile haue our {Michael Cassio} on the hip,
1089   Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe
1090   (For I feare {Cassio} with my Night- Cape too)
1091   Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,
1092   For making him egregiously an Asse,
1093   And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,
1094   Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,
1095   Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.  <D {Exit}.>
1096   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1097   <D {Enter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation}.>
1098  *<S {Herald}.> It is {Othello's} pleasure, our Noble and Vali-ant
1099  *Generall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,
1100  *importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete:
1101  *euery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce,
1102  *some to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and
1103  *Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these bene-ficiall
1104  *Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So
1105  *much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offi-ces
1106  *are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this
      <P tt2>
1107  *present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.
1108  *Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall {Othel-lo}.
1109   <D {Exit}.>
1110   <D {Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants}.>
1111  *<S {Othe}.> Good {Michael}, looke you to the guard to night.
1112   Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop,
1113   Not to out- sport discretion.
1114   <S {Cas}.> {Iago}, hath direction what to do.
1115   But notwithstanding with my personall eye
1116   Will I looke to't.
1117   <S {Othe}.> {Iago}, is most honest:
1118   {Michael}, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,
1119   Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,
1120   The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,
1121   That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.
1122   Goodnight.  <D {Exit}.>
1123   <D {Enter Iago}.>
1124   <S {Cas}.> Welcome {Iago}: we must to the Watch.
1125  *<S {Iago}.> Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten
1126  *o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the
1127  *loue of his {Desdemona}: Who, let vs not therefore blame;
1128  *he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and
1129   she is sport for {Ioue}.
1130   <S {Cas}.> She's a most exquisite Lady.
1131   <S {Iago}.> And Ile warrant her, full of Game.
1132  *<S {Cas}.> Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature.
1133   <S {Iago}.> What an eye she ha's?
1134   Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation.
1135   <S {Cas}.> An inuiting eye:
1136   And yet me thinkes right modest.
1137   <S {Iago}.> And when she speakes,
1138   Is it not an Alarum to Loue?
1139   <S {Cas}.> She is indeed perfection.
1140  *<S {Iago}.> Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieu-tenant,
1141  *I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a
1142  *brace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a mea-sure
1143   to the health of blacke {Othello}.
1144  *<S {Cas}.> Not to night, good {Iago}, I haue very poore,
1145  *and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish
1146  *Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of enter-tainment.
1147  _
1148  *<S {Iago}.> Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile
1149   drinke for you.
1150  *<S {Cassio}.> I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that
1151  *was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation
1152  *it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and
1153   dare not taske my weakenesse with any more.
1154  *<S {Iago}.> What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gal-lants
1155   desire it.
1156   <S {Cas}.> Where are they?
1157   <S {Iago}.> Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in.
1158   <S {Cas}.> Ile do't, but it dislikes me.  <D {Exit}.>
1159   <S {Iago}.> If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him
1160   With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,
1161   He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence
1162   As my yong Mistris dogge.
1163   Now my sicke Foole {Rodorigo},
1164   Whom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
1165   To {Desdemona} hath to night Carrows'd.
1166   Potations, pottle- deepe; and he's to watch.
1167   Three else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites,
1168   (That hold their Honours in a wary distance,
1169   The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)
1170   Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,
1171   And they Watch too.
1172   Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards
1173   Am I put to our {Cassio} in some Action
1174   That may offend the Isle. But here they come.
1175   <D {Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen}.>
1176   If Consequence do but approue my dreame,
1177   My Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame.
1178  *<S {Cas}.> 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already.
1179  *<S {Mon}.> Good- faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a
1180   Souldier.
1181   <S {Iago}.> Some Wine hoa.
1182   {And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:}
1183   {And let me the Cannakin clinke}.
1184   {A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span},
1185   {Why then let a Souldier drinke}.
1186   Some Wine Boyes.
1187   <S {Cas}.> 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song.
1188  *<S {Iago}.> I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are
1189  *most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,
1190  *and your swag- belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are
1191   nothing to your English.
1192  *<S {Cassio}.> Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drin-king?
1193  _
1194  *<S {Iago}.> Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane
1195  *dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Al-maine.
1196  *He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next
1197   Pottle can be fill'd.
1198   <S {Cas}.> To the health of our Generall.
1199  *<S {Mon}.> I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice.
1200   <S {Iago}.> Oh sweet England.
1201   {King Stephen was and-a worthy Peere},
1202   {His Breeches cost him but a Crowne},
1203   {He held them Six pence all #to deere},
1204   {With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:}
1205   {He was a wight of high Renowne},
1206   {And thou art but of low degree:}
1207   {'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe},
1208   {And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee}.
1209   Some Wine hoa.
1210  *<S {Cassio}.> Why this is a more exquisite Song then the o-ther.
1211  _
1212   <S {Iago}.> Will you heare't againe?
1213  *<S {Cas}.> No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,
1214  *that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and
1215  *there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must
1216   not be saued.
1217   <S {Iago}.> It's true, good Lieutenant.
1218  *<S {Cas}.> For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,
1219   nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued.
1220   <S {Iago}.> And so do I too Lieutenant.
1221  *<S {Cassio}.> #I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The
1222  *Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue
1223  *no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our
1224  *sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not
1225  *thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this
1226  *is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke
1227  *now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough.
1228   <S {Gent}.> Excellent well.
1229  *<S {Cas}.> Why very well then: you must not thinke then,
1230   that I am drunke.  <D {Exit}.>
1231  *<S {Monta}.> To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the
1232   Watch.
1233   <S {Iago}.> You see this Fellow, that is gone before,
1234   He's a Souldier, fit to stand by {Caesar},
1235   And giue direction. And do but see his vice,
1236   'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,
      <P tt2v>
1237   The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:
1238   I feare the trust {Othello} puts him in,
1239   On some odde time of his infirmitie
1240   Will shake this Island.
1241   <S {Mont}.> But is he often thus?
1242   <S {Iago}.> 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,
1243   He'le watch the Horologe a double Set,
1244   If Drinke rocke not his Cradle.
1245   <S {Mont}.> It were well
1246   The Generall were put in mind of it:
1247   Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
1248   Prizes the vertue that appeares in {Cassio},
1249   And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?
1250   <D {Enter Rodorigo}.>
1251   <S {Iago}.> How now {Rodorigo}?
1252   I pray you after the Lieutenant, go.
1253   <S {Mon}.> And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore
1254   Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second
1255   With one of an ingraft Infirmitie,
1256   It were an honest Action, to say so
1257   To the Moore.
1258   <S {Iago}.> Not I, for this faire Island,
1259   I do loue {Cassio} well: and would do much
1260   To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?
1261   <D {Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo}.>
1262   <S {Cas}.> You Rogue: you Rascall.
1263   <S {Mon}.> What's the matter Lieutenant?
1264   <S {Cas}.> A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the
1265   Knaue in to a Twiggen- Bottle.
1266   <S {Rod}.> Beate me?
1267   <S {Cas}.> Dost thou prate, Rogue?
1268   <S {Mon}.> Nay, good Lieutenant:
1269   I pray you Sir, hold your hand.
1270   <S {Cassio}.> Let me go (Sir)
1271   Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard.
1272   <S {Mon}.> Come, come: you're drunke.
1273   <S {Cassio}.> Drunke?
1274   <S {Iago}.> Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.
1275   Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:
1276   Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir {Montano}:
1277   Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.
1278   Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:
1279   The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,
1280   You'le be asham'd for euer.
1281   <D {Enter Othello, and Attendants}.>
1282   <S {Othe}.> What is the matter heere?
1283   <S {Mon}.> I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies.
1284   <S {Othe}.> Hold for your liues.
1285  *<S {Iag}.> Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir {Montano}, Gentlemen:
1286   Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?
1287   Hold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame.
1288  *<S {Oth}.> Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?
1289   Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that
1290   Which Heauen hath forbid the {Ottamittes}.
1291   For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:
1292   He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,
1293   Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.
1294   Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,
1295   From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?
1296   Honest {Iago}, that lookes dead with greeuing,
1297   Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?
1298   <S {Iago}.> I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.
1299   In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome
1300   Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:
1301   (As if some Planet had vnwitted men)
1302   Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes,
1303   In opposition bloody. I cannot speake
1304   Any begining to this peeuish oddes.
1305   And would, in Action glorious, I had lost
1306   Those legges, that brought me to a part of it.
1307  *<S {Othe}.> How comes it ({Michaell}) you are thus forgot?
1308   <S {Cas}.> I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake.
1309   <S {Othe}.> Worthy {Montano}, you were wont to be ciuill:
1310   The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth
1311   The world hath noted. And your name is great
1312   In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter
1313   That you vnlace your reputation thus,
1314   And spend your rich opinion, for the name
1315   Of a night- brawler? Giue me answer to it.
1316   <S {Mon}.> Worthy {Othello}, I am hurt to danger,
1317   Your Officer {Iago}, can informe you,
1318  *While I spare speech which something now offends me.
1319   Of all that I do know, nor know I ought
1320   By me, that's said, or done amisse this night,
1321   Vnlesse selfe- charitie be sometimes a vice,
1322   And to defend our selues, it be a sinne
1323   When violence assailes vs.
1324   <S {Othe}.> Now by Heauen,
1325   My blood begins my safer Guides to rule,
1326   And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)
1327   Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,
1328   Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you
1329   Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know
1330   How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,
1331   And he that is approu'd in this offence,
1332   Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
1333   Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,
1334   Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim- full of feare,
1335   To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?
1336   In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?
1337   'Tis monstrous: {Iago}, who began't?
1338   <S {Mon}.> If partially Affin'd, or league in office,
1339   Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,
1340   Thou art no Souldier.
1341   <S {Iago}.> Touch me not so neere,
1342   I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,
1343   Then it should do offence to {Michaell Cassio}.
1344   Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth
1345   Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:
1346   {Montano} and my selfe being in speech,
1347   There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,
1348   And {Cassio} following him with determin'd Sword
1349   To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,
1350   Steppes in to {Cassio}, and entreats his pause:
1351   My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,
1352   Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)
1353   The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)
1354   Out- ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather
1355   For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,
1356   And {Cassio} high in oath: Which till to night
1357   I nere might say before. When I came backe
1358   (For this was briefe) I found them close together
1359   At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were
1360   When you your selfe did part them.
1361   More of this matter cannot I report,
1362   But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,
1363   Though {Cassio} did some little wrong to him,
1364   As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
1365   Yet surely {Cassio}, I beleeue receiu'd
1366   From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,
1367   Which patience could not passe.
      <P tt3>
1368   <S {Othe}.> I know {Iago}
1369   Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,
1370   Making it light to {Cassio}: {Cassio}, I loue thee,
1371   But neuer more be Officer of mine.
1372   <D {Enter Desdemona attended}.>
1373   Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:
1374   Ile make thee an example.
1375   <S {Des}.> What is the matter (Deere?)
1376   <S {Othe}.> All's well, Sweeting:
1377   Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts,
1378   My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:
1379   {#Iago}, looke with care about the Towne,
1380   And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.
1381   Come {Desdemona}, 'tis the Soldiers life,
1382   To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.  <D {Exit}.>
1383   <S {Iago}.> What are you hurt Lieutenant?
1384   <S {Cas}.> #I, past all Surgery.
1385   <S {Iago}.> Marry Heauen forbid.
1386  *<S {Cas}.> Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue
1387  *lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of
1388  *myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,
1389   {Iago}, my Reputation.
1390  *<S {Iago}.> As I am an honest man I had thought you had
1391  *receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that
1392  *then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false
1393  *imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without de-seruing.
1394  *You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
1395  *repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
1396  *more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
1397  *but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in poli-cie,
1398  *then in malice) euen so as one would beate his of-fencelesse
1399  *dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to
1400   him againe, and he's yours.
1401  *<S {Cas}.> I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue
1402  *so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so
1403  *indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And
1404  *squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian
1405  *with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of
1406  *Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call
1407   thee Diuell.
1408  *<S {Iago}.> What was he that you follow'd with your
1409   Sword? What had he done to you?
1410   <S {Cas}.> I know not.
1411   <S {Iago}.> Is't possible?
1412  *<S {Cas}.> I remember a masse of things, but nothing di-stinctly:
1413  *a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
1414  *men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale a-way
1415  *their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
1416   reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts.
1417  *<S {Iago}.> Why? But you are now well enough: how
1418   came you thus recouered?
1419  *<S {Cas}.> It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
1420  *place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
1421   another to make me frankly despise my selfe.
1422  *<S {Iago}.> Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the
1423  *Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands
1424  *I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as
1425   it is, mend it for your owne good.
1426  *<S {Cas}.> I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
1427  *me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as {Hydra},
1428  *such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sen-sible
1429  *man, #by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
1430  *strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingre-dient
1431   is a diuell.
1432  *<S {Iago}.> Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar
1433  *Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.
1434  *And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue
1435   you.
1436   <S {Cassio}.> I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
1437  *<S {Iago}.> You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
1438  *time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
1439  *Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
1440  *for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
1441  *Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
1442  *and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Impor-tune
1443  *her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
1444  *of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
1445  *she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
1446  *then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
1447  *you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
1448  *Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
1449   your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before.
1450   <S {Cassio}.> You aduise me well.
1451  *<S {Iago}.> I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
1452   kindnesse.
1453  *<S {Cassio}.> I thinke it freely: and betimes in the mor-ning,
1454  *I will beseech the vertuous {Desdemona} to vndertake
1455   for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me.
1456  *<S {Iago}.> You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I
1457   must to the Watch.
1458   <S {Cassio}.> Good night, honest {Iago}.
1459   <D {Exit Cassio}.>
1460   <S {Iago}.> And what's he then,
1461   That saies I play the Villaine?
1462   When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,
1463   Proball to thinking, and indeed the course
1464   To win the Moore againe.
1465   For 'tis most easie
1466   Th' inclyning {Desdemona} to subdue
1467   In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull
1468   As the free Elements. And then for her
1469   To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,
1470   All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:
1471   His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,
1472   That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,
1473   Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,
1474   With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,
1475   To Counsell {Cassio} to this paralell course,
1476   Directly to his good? Diuinitie of #hell,
1477   When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,
1478   They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,
1479   As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole
1480   Plies {Desdemona}, to repaire his Fortune,
1481   And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,
1482   Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:
1483   That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,
1484   And by how much she striues to do him good,
1485   She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.
1486   So will I turne her vertue into pitch.
1487   And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,
1488   That shall en- mash them all.
1489   How now {Rodorigo}?
1490   <D {Enter Rodorigo}.>
1491  *<S {Rodorigo}.> I do follow heere in the Chace, not
1492  *like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
1493  *Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
1494  *exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
      <P tt3v><C B>
1495  *will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
1496  *And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, re-turne
1497   againe to Venice.
1498   <S {Iago}.> How poore are they that haue not Patience?
1499   What wound did euer heale but by degrees?
1500  *Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft
1501   And Wit depends on dilatory time:
1502   #Dos't not go well? {Cassio} hath beaten thee,
1503   And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd {Cassio}:
1504   Though other things grow faire against the Sun,
1505   Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:
1506   Content thy selfe, a- while. Introth 'tis Morning;
1507   Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.
1508   Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:
1509   Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:
1510   Nay get thee gone.  <D {Exit Roderigo}.>
1511   Two things are to be done:
1512   My Wife must moue for {Cassio} to her Mistris:
1513  *Ile set her on my selfe, #a while, to draw the Moor apart,
1514   And bring him iumpe, when he may {Cassio} finde
1515   Soliciting his wife: #I, that's the way:
1516   Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.  <D {Exit}.>
1517   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1518   <D {Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne}.>
1519  *<S {Cassio}.> Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,
1520  *Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General.
1521  *<S {Clo}.> Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Na-ples,
1522   that they speake i'th' Nose thus?
1523   <S {Mus}.> How Sir? how?
1524   <S {Clo}.> Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?
1525   <S {Mus}.> #I marry are they sir.
1526   <S {Clo}.> Oh, thereby hangs a tale.
1527   <S {Mus}.> Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
1528  *<S {Clow}.> Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I
1529  *know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Ge-nerall
1530  *so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues
1531   sake to make no more noise with it.
1532   <S {Mus}.> Well Sir, we will not.
1533  *<S {Clo}.> If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,
1534  *too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Ge-nerall
1535   do's not greatly care.
1536   <S {Mus}.> We haue none such, sir.
1537  *<S {Clow}.> Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile
1538   away. Go, vanish into ayre, away.  <D {Exit Mu}.>
1539   <S {Cassio}.> Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?
1540   <S {Clo}.> No, I heare not your honest Friend:
1541   I heare you.
1542  *<S {Cassio}.> Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore
1543  *peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends
1544  *the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one {Cassio} en-treats
1545  *her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?
1546  *<S {Clo}.> She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall
1547   seeme to notifie vnto her.  <D {Exit Clo}.>
1548   <D {Enter Iago}.>
1549   In happy time, {Iago}.
1550   <S {Iago}.> You haue not bin a- bed then?
1551  *<S {Cassio}.> Why no: the day had broke before we parted.
1552   I haue made bold ({Iago}) to send in to your wife:
1553   My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous {Desdemona}
1554   Procure me some accesse.
1555   <S {Iago}.> Ile send her to you presently:
1556   And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore
1557   Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse
1558   May be more free.  <D {Exit}>
1559   <S {Cassio}.> I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew
1560   A Florentine more kinde, and honest.
1561   <D {Enter Aemilia}.>
1562  *<S {Aemil}.> Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie
1563   For your displeasure: but all will sure be well.
1564   The Generall and his wife are talking of it,
1565   And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,
1566   That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,
1567   And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome
1568  *He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you
1569   And needs no other Suitor, but his likings
1570   To bring you in againe.
1571   <S {Cassio}.> Yet I beseech you,
1572   If you thinke fit, or that it may be done,
1573   Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse
1574   With {Desdemon} alone.
1575   <S {Aemil}.> Pray you come in:
1576   I will bestow you where you shall haue time
1577   To speake your bosome freely.
1578   <S {Cassio}.> I am much bound to you.
1579   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1580   <D {Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen}.>
1581   <S {Othe}.> These Letters giue ({Iago}) to the Pylot,
1582   And by him do my duties to the Senate:
1583   That done, I will be walking on the Workes,
1584   Repaire there to mee.
1585   <S {Iago}.> Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't.
1586   <S {Oth}.> This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?
1587   <S {Gent}.> #Well waite vpon your Lordship.  <D {Exeunt}>
1588   <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
1589   <D {Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Aemilia}.>
1590   <S {Des}.> Be thou assur'd (good {Cassio}) I will do
1591   All my abilities in thy behalfe.
1592   <S {Aemil}.> Good Madam do:
1593   I warrant it greeues my Husband,
1594   As if the cause were his.
1595  *<S {Des}.> Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt {Cassio}
1596   But I will haue my Lord, and you againe
1597   As friendly as you were.
1598   <S {Cassio}.> Bounteous Madam,
1599   What euer shall become of {Michael Cassio},
1600   He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant.
1601  *<S {Des}.> I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:
1602   You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd
1603   He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,
1604   Then in a politique distance.
1605   <S {Cassio}.> #I, but Lady,
1606   That policie may either last so long,
1607   Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,
1608   Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,
1609   That I being absent, and my place supply'd,
1610   My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice.
1611   <S {Des}.> Do not doubt that: before {Aemilia} here,
      <P tt4>
1612   I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
1613   If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it
1614   To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,
1615   Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;
1616   His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,
1617   Ile intermingle euery thing he do's
1618   With {Cassio's} suite: Therefore be merry {Cassio},
1619   For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,
1620   Then giue thy cause away.
1621   <D {Enter Othello, and Iago}.>
1622   <S {Aemil}.> Madam, heere comes my Lord.
1623   <S {Cassio}.> Madam, Ile take my leaue.
1624   <S {Des}.> Why stay, and heare me speake.
1625   <S {Cassio}.> Madam, not now: I am very #ill at ease,
1626   Vnfit for mine owne purposes.
1627   <S {Des}.> Well, do your discretion.  <D {Exit Cassio}.>
1628   <S {Iago}.> Hah? I like not that.
1629   <S {Othel}.> What dost thou say?
1630   <S {Iago}.> Nothing my Lord; or if=== I know not what.
1631   <S {Othel}.> Was not that {Cassio} parted from my wife?
1632   <S {Iago}.> {Cassio} my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it
1633   That he would steale away so guilty- like,
1634   Seeing your comming.
1635   <S {Oth}.> I do beleeue 'twas he.
1636   <S {Des}.> How now my Lord?
1637   I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,
1638   A man that languishes in your displeasure.
1639   <S {Oth}.> Who is't you meane?
1640   <S {Des}.> Why your Lieutenant {Cassio}: Good my Lord,
1641   If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,
1642   His present reconciliation take.
1643   For if he be not one, that truly loues you,
1644   That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,
1645   I haue no iudgement in an honest face.
1646   I prythee call him backe.
1647   <S {Oth}.> Went he hence now?
1648   <S {Des}.> #I sooth; so humbled,
1649   That he hath left part of his greefe with mee
1650   To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe.
1651   <S {Othel}.> Not now (sweet {Desdemon}) some other time.
1652   <S {Des}.> But shall't be shortly?
1653   <S {Oth}.> The sooner (Sweet) for you.
1654   <S {Des}.> Shall't be to night, at Supper?
1655   <S {Oth}.> No, not to night.
1656   <S {Des}.> To morrow Dinner then?
1657   <S {Oth}.> I shall not dine at home:
1658   I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell.
1659  *<S {Des}.> Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,
1660   On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.
1661   I prythee name the time, but let it not
1662   Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:
1663   And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason
1664   (Saue that they say the warres must make example)
1665   Out of her best, is not almost a fault
1666   T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?
1667   Tell me {Othello}. I wonder in my Soule
1668   What you would aske me, that I should deny,
1669   Or stand so mam'ring on? What? {Michael Cassio},
1670   That came #a woing with you? and so many a time
1671   (When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)
1672   Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do
1673   To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much.
1674  *<S {Oth}.> Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:
1675   I will deny thee nothing.
1676   <S {Des}.> Why, this is not a Boone:
1677   'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,
1678   Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,
1679   Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit
1680   To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite
1681   Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,
1682   It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,
1683   And fearefull to be granted.
1684   <S {Oth}.> I will deny thee nothing.
1685   Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
1686   To leaue me but a little to my selfe.
1687   <S {Des}.> Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord.
1688  *<S {Oth}.> Farewell my {Desdemona}, Ile come to thee strait.
1689   <S {Des}.> {Aemilia} come; be as your Fancies teach you:
1690   What ere you be, I am obedient.  <D {Exit}.>
1691   <S {Oth}.> Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule
1692   But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,
1693   Chaos is come againe.
1694   <S {Iago}.> My Noble Lord.
1695   <S {Oth}.> What dost thou say, {Iago}?
1696   <S {Iago}.> Did {Michael Cassio}
1697   When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?
1698   <S {Oth}.> He did, from first to last:
1699   Why dost thou aske?
1700   <S {Iago}.> But for a satisfaction of my Thought,
1701   No further harme.
1702   <S {Oth}.> Why of thy thought, {Iago}?
1703  *<S {Iago}.> I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir.
1704   <S {Oth}.> O yes, and went betweene vs very oft.
1705   <S {Iago}.> Indeed?
1706  *<S {Oth}.> Indeed? #I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?
1707   Is he not honest?
1708   <S {Iago}.> Honest, my Lord?
1709   <S {Oth}.> Honest? #I, Honest.
1710   <S {Iago}.> My Lord, for ought I know.
1711   <S {Oth}.> What do'st thou thinke?
1712   <S {Iago}.> Thinke, my Lord?
1713   <S {Oth}.> Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;
1714   As if there were some Monster in thy thought
1715  *Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:
1716   I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,
1717   When {Cassio} left my wife. What didd'st not like?
1718   And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,
1719  *Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?
1720   And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,
1721   As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine
1722   Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,
1723   Shew me thy thought.
1724   <S {Iago}.> My Lord, you know I loue you.
1725   <S {Oth}.> I thinke thou do'st:
1726   And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,
1727  *And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
1728   Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:
1729   For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
1730   Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,
1731   They're close dilations, working from the heart,
1732   That Passion cannot rule.
1733   <S {Iago}.> For {Michael Cassio},
1734   I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest.
1735   <S {Oth}.> I thinke so too.
1736   <S {Iago}.> Men should be what they seeme,
1737   Or those that be not, would they might seeme none.
1738   <S {Oth}.> Certaine, men should be what they seeme.
1739   <S {Iago}.> Why then I thinke {Cassio}'s an honest man.
1740   <S {Oth}.> Nay, yet there's more in this?
1741   I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,
1742   As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts
      <P tt4v>
1743   The worst of words.
1744   <S {Iago}.> Good my Lord pardon me,
1745   Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,
1746   I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:
1747  *Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?
1748   As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things
1749   Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,
1750   Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
1751   Keepe Leetes, and Law- dayes, and in Sessions sit
1752   With meditations lawfull?
1753   <S {Oth}.> Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend ({Iago})
1754   If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare
1755   A stranger to thy Thoughts.
1756   <S {Iago}.> I do beseech you,
1757   Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
1758   (As I confesse it is my Natures plague
1759   To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie
1760   Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome
1761   From one, that so imperfectly conceits,
1762   Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble
1763   Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:
1764   It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
1765   Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,
1766   To let you know my thoughts.
1767   <S {Oth}.> What dost thou meane?
1768  *<S {Iago}.> Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)
1769   Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;
1770   Who steales my purse, steales trash:
1771   'Tis something, nothing;
1772   'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:
1773   But he that filches from me my good Name,
1774   Robs me of that, which not enriches him,
1775   And makes me poore indeed.
1776   <S {Oth}.> Ile know thy Thoughts.
1777   <S {Iago}.> You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
1778   Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie.
1779   <S {Oth}.> Ha?
1780   <S {Iago}.> Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,
1781   It is the greene- ey'd Monster, which doth mocke
1782   The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,
1783   Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:
1784   But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,
1785   Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?
1786   <S {Oth}.> O miserie.
1787  *<S {Iago}.> Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,
1788   But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,
1789   To him that euer feares he shall be poore:
1790   Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend
1791   From Iealousie.
1792   <S {Oth}.> Why? why is this?
1793   Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;
1794   To follow still the changes of the Moone
1795   With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,
1796   Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,
1797   When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
1798   To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,
1799   Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,
1800   To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,
1801   Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:
1802   Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.
1803   Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw
1804   The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,
1805   For she had eyes, and chose me. No {Iago},
1806   Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;
1807   And on the proofe, there is no more but this,
1808   Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie.
1809   <S {Ia}.> I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason
1810   To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
1811   With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)
1812   Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:
1813   Looke to your wife, obserue her well with {Cassio},
1814   Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:
1815   I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,
1816   Out of selfe- Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:
1817   I know our Country disposition well:
1818   In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes
1819   They dare not shew their Husbands.
1820   Their best Conscience,
1821   Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne.
1822   <S {Oth}.> Dost thou say so?
1823   <S {Iago}.> She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,
1824   And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,
1825   She lou'd them most.
1826   <S {Oth}.> And so she did.
1827   <S {Iago}.> Why go #too then:
1828   Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
1829   To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,
1830   He thought 'twas Witchcraft.
1831   But I am much #too blame:
1832   I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
1833   For too much louing you.
1834   <S {Oth}.> I am bound to thee for euer.
1835   <S {Iago}.> I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:
1836   <S {Oth}.> Not a iot, not a iot.
1837   <S {Iago}.> Trust me, I feare it has:
1838   I hope you will consider what is spoke
1839   Comes from your Loue.
1840   But I do see y'are moou'd:
1841   I am to pray you, not to straine my speech
1842   To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,
1843   Then to Suspition.
1844   <S {Oth}.> I will not.
1845   <S {Iago}.> Should you do so (my Lord)
1846   My speech should fall into such vilde successe,
1847   Which my Thoughts aym'd not.
1848   {Cassio}'s my worthy Friend:
1849   My Lord, I see y'are mou'd.
1850   <S {Oth}.> No, not much mou'd:
1851   I do not thinke but {Desdemona}'s honest.
1852   <S {Iago}.> Long liue she so;
1853   And long liue you to thinke so.
1854   <S {Oth}.> And yet how Nature erring from it selfe.
1855   <S {Iago}.> #I, there's the point:
1856   As (to be bold with you)
1857   Not to affect many proposed Matches
1858   Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,
1859   Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:
1860   Foh, one may smel in such, a #will most ranke,
1861   Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.
1862   But (pardon me) I do not in position
1863   Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare
1864   Her #will, recoyling to her better iudgement,
1865   May fal to match you with her Country formes,
1866   And happily repent.
1867   <S {Oth}.> Farewell, farewell:
1868   If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:
1869   Set on thy wife to obserue.
1870   Leaue me {Iago}.
1871   <S {Iago}.> My Lord, I take my leaue.
1872   <S {Othel}.> Why did I marry?
1873   This honest Creature (doubtlesse)
1874   Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds.
      <P tt5>
1875  *<S {Iago}.> My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor
1876   To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,
1877   Although 'tis fit that {Cassio} haue his Place;
1878   For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;
1879   Yet if you please, to him off a- while:
1880   You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:
1881   Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
1882   With any strong, or vehement importunitie,
1883   Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,
1884   Let me be thought too busie in my feares,
1885   (As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)
1886   And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.
1887   <S {Oth}.> Feare not my gouernment.
1888   <S {Iago}.> I once more take my leaue.  <D {Exit}.>
1889   <S {Oth}.> This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,
1890   And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit
1891   Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,
1892   Though that her Iesses were my deere heart- strings,
1893   I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde
1894   To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,
1895   And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
1896   That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd
1897   Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)
1898   Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe
1899   Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!
1900   That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,
1901   And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,
1902   And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,
1903   Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
1904   For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great- ones,
1905   Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,
1906   'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:
1907   Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,
1908   When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:
1909   <D {Enter Desdemona and Aemilia}.>
1910   If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:
1911   Ile not beleeue't.
1912   <S {Des}.> How now, my deere {Othello}?
1913   Your dinner, and the generous Islanders
1914   By you inuited, do attend your presence.
1915   <S {Oth}.> I am #too blame.
1916   <S {Des}.> Why do you speake so faintly?
1917   Are you not well?
1918   <S {Oth}.> I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere.
1919  *<S {Des}.> Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.
1920   Let me but binde it hard, within this houre
1921   It will be well.
1922   <S {Oth}.> Your Napkin is too little:
1923   Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.  <D {Exit}.>
1924   <S {Des}.> I am very sorry that you are not well.
1925   <S {Aemil}.> I am glad I haue found this Napkin:
1926   This was her first remembrance from the Moore,
1927   My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
1928   Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,
1929   (For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)
1930   That she reserues it euermore about her,
1931   To kisse, and talke #too. Ile haue the worke tane out,
1932   And giu't {Iago}: what he will do with it
1933   Heauen knowes, not I:
1934   I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.
1935   <D {Enter Iago}.>
1936   <S {Iago}.> How now? What do you heere alone?
1937   <S {Aemil}.> Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you.
1938   <S {Iago}.> You haue a thing for me?
1939   It is a common thing===
1940   <S {Aemil}.> Hah?
1941   <S {Iago}.> To haue a foolish wife.
1942   <S {Aemil}.> Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now
1943   For that same Handkerchiefe.
1944   <S {Iago}.> What Handkerchiefe?
1945   <S {Aemil}.> What Handkerchiefe?
1946   Why that the Moore first gaue to {Desdemona},
1947   That which so often you did bid me steale.
1948   <S {Iago}.> Hast stolne it from her?
1949   <S {Aemil}.> No: but she let it drop by negligence,
1950   And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:
1951   Looke, heere 'tis.
1952   <S {Iago}.> A good wench, giue it me.
1953  *<S {Aemil}.> What will you do with't, that you haue bene
1954   so earnest to haue me filch it?
1955   <S {Iago}.> Why, what is that to you?
1956   <S {Aemil}.> If it be not for some purpose of import,
1957   Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad
1958   When she shall lacke it.
1959   <S {Iago}.> Be not acknowne on't:
1960   I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.  <D {Exit Aemil}.>
1961   I will in {Cassio's} Lodging loose this Napkin,
1962   And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,
1963   Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,
1964   As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.
1965   The Moore already changes with my poyson:
1966   Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,
1967   Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:
1968   But with a little acte vpon the blood,
1969   Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.
1970   <D {Enter Othello}.>
1971   Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,
1972   Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
1973   Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
1974   Which thou owd'st yesterday.
1975   <S {Oth}.> Ha, ha, false to mee?
1976   <S {Iago}.> Why how now Generall? No more of that.
1977  *<S {Oth}.> Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:
1978   I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,
1979   Then but to know't a little.
1980   <S {Iago}.> How now, my Lord?
1981   <S {Oth}.> What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?
1982   I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:
1983  *I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.
1984   I found not {Cassio's} kisses on her Lippes:
1985   He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,
1986   Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
1987   <S {Iago}.> I am sorry to heare this?
1988   <S {Oth}.> I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,
1989   Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,
1990   So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer
1991   Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;
1992   Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,
1993   That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,
1994   Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,
1995   The Spirit- stirring Drum, th' Eare- piercing Fife,
1996   The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,
1997   Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:
1998   And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates
1999   Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,
2000   Farewell: {Othello's} Occupation's gone.
2001   <S {Iago}.> Is't possible my Lord?
2002  *<S {Oth}.> Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;
2003   Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,
      <P tt5v>
2004   Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,
2005   Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog
2006   Then answer my wak'd wrath.
2007   <S {Iago}.> Is't come to this?
2008   <S {Oth}.> Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,
2009   That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,
2010   To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life.
2011   <S {Iago}.> My Noble Lord.
2012   <S {Oth}.> If thou dost slander her, and torture me,
2013   Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse
2014   On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:
2015   Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;
2016   For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,
2017   Greater then that.
2018   <S {Iago}.> O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!
2019   Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?
2020   God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,
2021   That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!
2022  *Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)
2023   To be direct and honest, is not safe.
2024   I thanke you for this profit, and from hence
2025   Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence.
2026   <S {Oth}.> Nay stay: thou should'st be honest.
2027   <S {Iago}.> I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,
2028   And looses that it workes for.
2029   <S {Oth}.> By the World,
2030   I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:
2031   I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:
2032   Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh
2033   As {Dians} Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke
2034   As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,
2035   Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,
2036   Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied.
2037   <S {Iago}.> I see you are eaten vp with Passion:
2038   I do repent me, that I put it to you.
2039   You would be satisfied?
2040   <S {Oth}.> Would? Nay, and I will.
2041  *<S {Iago}.> And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?
2042   Would you the super- vision grossely gape on?
2043   Behold her top'd?
2044   <S {Oth}.> Death, and damnation. Oh!
2045   <S {Iago}.> It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,
2046   To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,
2047   If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
2048   More then their owne. What then? How then?
2049   What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?
2050   It is impossible you should see this,
2051   Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,
2052   As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse
2053   As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,
2054   If imputation, and strong circumstances,
2055   Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,
2056   Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't.
2057   <S {Oth}.> Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall.
2058   <S {Iago}.> I do not like the Office.
2059   But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
2060   (Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)
2061   I will go on. I lay with {Cassio} lately,
2062   And being troubled with a raging tooth,
2063   I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,
2064   So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter
2065   Their Affayres: one of this kinde is {Cassio}:
2066   In sleepe I heard him say, sweet {Desdemona},
2067   Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,
2068   And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:
2069   Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,
2070   As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,
2071   That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,
2072   And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,
2073   That gaue thee to the Moore.
2074   <S {Oth}.> O monstrous! monstrous!
2075   <S {Iago}.> Nay, this was but his Dreame.
2076   <S {Oth}.> But this denoted a fore- gone conclusion,
2077   'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame.
2078   <S {Iago}.> And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,
2079   That do demonstrate thinly.
2080   <S {Oth}.> Ile teare her all to peeces.
2081   <S {Iago}.> Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,
2082   She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,
2083   Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
2084   Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?
2085   <S {Oth}.> I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift.
2086   <S {Iago}.> I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe
2087   (I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day
2088   See {Cassio} wipe his Beard with.
2089   <S {Oth}.> If it be that.
2090   <S {Iago}.> If it be that, or any, it was here.
2091   It speakes against her with the other proofes.
2092   <S {Othel}.> O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:
2093   One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.
2094   Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere {Iago},
2095  *All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.
2096   Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow #hell,
2097   Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne
2098   To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,
2099   For 'tis of Aspickes tongues.
2100   <S {Iago}.> Yet be content.
2101   <S {Oth}.> Oh blood, blood, blood.
2102   <S {Iago}.> Patience I say: your minde may change.
2103   <S {Oth}.> Neuer {Iago}. Like to the Ponticke Sea,
2104   Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,
2105   Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on
2106   To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:
2107   Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace
2108   Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,
2109   Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge
2110   Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,
2111   In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,
2112   I heere engage my words.
2113   <S {Iago}.> Do not rise yet:
2114   Witnesse you euer- burning Lights aboue,
2115   You Elements, that clip vs round about,
2116   Witnesse that heere {Iago} doth giue vp
2117   The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
2118   To wrong'd {Othello's} Seruice. Let him command,
2119   And to obey shall be in me remorse,
2120   What bloody businesse euer.
2121   <S {Oth}.> I greet thy loue,
2122  *Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
2123   And will vpon the instant put thee too't.
2124   Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,
2125   That {Cassio}'s not aliue.
2126   <S {Iago}.> My Friend is dead:
2127   'Tis done at your Request.
2128   But let her liue.
2129   <S {Oth}.> Damne her lewde Minx:
2130   O damne her, damne her.
2131   Come go with me a- part, I will withdraw
2132   To furnish me with some swift meanes of death
2133   For the faire Diuell.
2134   Now art thou my Lieutenant.
2135   <S {Iago}.> I am your owne for euer.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P tt6>
2136   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>
2137   <D {Enter Desdemona, Aemilia, and Clown}.>
2138  *<S {Des}.> Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant {Cassio}
2139   lyes?
2140   <S {Clow}.> I dare not say he lies any where.
2141   <S {Des}.> Why man?
2142  *<S {Clo}.> He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,
2143   'tis stabbing.
2144   <S {Des}.> Go #too: where lodges he?
2145  *<S {Clo}.> To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where
2146   I lye.
2147   <S {Des}.> Can any thing be made of this?
2148  *<S {Clo}.> I know not where he lodges, and for mee to de-uise
2149  *a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were
2150   to lye in mine owne throat.
2151  *<S {Des}.> Can you enquire him out? and be edified by re-port?
2152  _
2153  *<S {Clo}.> I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make
2154   Questions, and by them answer.
2155  *<S {Des}.> Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I
2156  *haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will
2157   be well.
2158  *<S {Clo}.> To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,
2159   and therefore I will attempt the doing it.  <D {Exit Clo}.>
2160  *<S {Des}.> Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, {Ae-milia}?
2161  _
2162   <S {Aemil}.> I know not Madam.
2163   <S {Des}.> Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse
2164   Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore
2165   Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,
2166   As iealious Creatures are, it were enough
2167   To put him to ill- thinking.
2168   <S {Aemil}.> Is he not iealious?
2169  *<S {Des}.> Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,
2170   Drew all such humors from him.
2171   <S {Aemil}.> Looke where he comes.
2172   <D {Enter Othello}.>
2173   <S {Des}.> I will not leaue him now, till {Cassio} be
2174   Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?
2175  *<S {Oth}.> Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!
2176   How do you, {Desdemona}?
2177   <S {Des}.> Well, my good Lord.
2178   <S {Oth}.> Giue me your hand.
2179   This hand is moist, my Lady.
2180   <S {Des}.> It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow.
2181   <S {Oth}.> This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:
2182   Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires
2183   A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,
2184   Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,
2185   For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere
2186   That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,
2187   A franke one.
2188   <S {Des}.> You may (indeed) say so:
2189   For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart.
2190  *<S {Oth}.> A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:
2191   But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts.
2192   <S {Des}.> I cannot speake of this:
2193   Come, now your promise.
2194   <S {Oth}.> What promise, Chucke?
2195   <S {Des}.> I haue sent to bid {Cassio} come speake with you.
2196   <S {Oth}.> I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:
2197   Lend me thy Handkerchiefe.
2198   <S {Des}.> Heere my Lord.
2199   <S {Oth}.> That which I gaue you.
2200   <S {Des}.> I haue it not about me.
2201   <S {Oth}.> Not?
2202   <S {Des}.> No indeed, my Lord.
2203   <S {Oth}.> That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe
2204   Did an Aegyptian to my Mother giue:
2205   She was a Charmer, and could almost read
2206  *The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
2207   'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father
2208   Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,
2209   Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye
2210   Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt
2211   After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,
2212   And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)
2213   To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,
2214   Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:
2215   To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,
2216   As nothing else could match.
2217   <S {Des}.> Is't possible?
2218   <S {Oth}.> 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:
2219   A {Sybill} that had numbred in the world
2220   The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,
2221   In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:
2222   The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,
2223   And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull
2224   Conseru'd of Maidens hearts.
2225   <S {Des}.> Indeed? Is't true?
2226   <S {Oth}.> Most veritable, therefore looke too't well.
2227  *<S {Des}.> Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?
2228   <S {Oth}.> Ha? wherefore?
2229   <S {Des}.> Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?
2230   <S {Oth}.> Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?
2231   <S {Des}.> Blesse vs.
2232   <S {Oth}.> Say you?
2233   <S {Des}.> It is not lost: but what #and if it were?
2234   <S {Oth}.> How?
2235   <S {Des}.> I say it is not lost.
2236   <S {Oth}.> Fetcht, let me see't.
2237   <S {Des}.> Why so I can: but I will not now:
2238   This is a tricke to put me from my suite,
2239   Pray you let {Cassio} be receiu'd againe.
2240   <S {Oth}.> Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,
2241   My minde mis- giues.
2242  *<S {Des}.> Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more suffici-ent
2243   man.
2244   <S {Oth}.> The Handkerchiefe.
2245   <S {Des}.> A man that all his time
2246   Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;
2247   Shar'd dangers with you.
2248   <S {Oth}.> The Handkerchiefe.
2249   <S {Des}.> Insooth, you are #too blame.
2250   <S {Oth}.> Away.  <D {Exit Othello}.>
2251   <S {Aemil}.> Is not this man iealious?
2252   <S {Des}.> I neu'r saw this before.
2253   Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,
2254   I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.
2255   <S {Aemil}.> 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:
2256   They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,
2257   They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full
2258   They belch vs.
2259   <D {Enter Iago, and Cassio}.>
2260   Looke you, {Cassio} and my Husband.
2261   <S {Iago}.> There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:
2262   And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her.
      <P tt6v>
2263  *<S {Des}.> How now (good {Cassio}) what's the newes with
2264   you?
2265   <S {Cassio}.> Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,
2266   That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe
2267   Exist, and be a member of his loue,
2268   Whom I, with all the Office of my heart
2269   Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.
2270   If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,
2271   That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,
2272   Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
2273   Can ransome me into his loue againe,
2274   But to know so, must be my benefit:
2275   So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,
2276   And shut my selfe vp in some other course
2277   To Fortunes Almes.
2278   <S {Des}.> Alas (thrice- gentle {Cassio})
2279   My Aduocation is not now in Tune;
2280   My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,
2281   Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.
2282   So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,
2283   As I haue spoken for you all my best,
2284   And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
2285   For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:
2286   What I can do, I will: and more I will
2287   Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you.
2288   <S {Iago}.> Is my Lord angry?
2289   <S {Aemil}.> He went hence but now:
2290   And certainly in strange vnquietnesse.
2291   <S {Iago}.> Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon
2292   When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,
2293   And like the Diuell from his very Arme
2294   Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?
2295   Something of moment then: I will go meet him,
2296   There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.  <D {Exit}>
2297   <S {Des}.> I prythee do so. Something sure of State,
2298   Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise
2299   Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,
2300   Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,
2301   Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,
2302   Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.
2303   For let our finger ake, and it endues
2304   Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense
2305   Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,
2306   Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
2307   As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, {Aemilia},
2308   I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)
2309   Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:
2310   But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,
2311   And he's Indited falsely.
2312   <S {Aemil}.> Pray heauen it bee
2313   State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,
2314   Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you.
2315   <S {Des}.> Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.
2316   <S {Aemil}.> But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;
2317   They are not euer iealious for the cause,
2318   But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster
2319   Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe.
2320  *<S {Des}.> Heauen keepe the Monster from {Othello's} mind.
2321   <S {Aemil}.> Lady, Amen.
2322   <S {Des}.> I will go seeke him. {Cassio}, walke heere about:
2323   If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,
2324   And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.  <D {Exit}>
2325   <S {Cas}.> I humbly thanke your Ladyship.
2326   <D {Enter Bianca}.>
2327   <S {Bian}.> 'Saue you (Friend {Cassio}.)
2328   <S {Cassio}.> What make you from home?
2329   How is't with you, my most faire {Bianca}?
2330   Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house.
2331   <S {Bian}.> And I was going to your Lodging, {Cassio}.
2332  *What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?
2333   Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres
2334   More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?
2335   Oh weary reck'ning.
2336   <S {Cassio}.> Pardon me, {Bianca}:
2337   I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,
2338   But I shall in a more continuate time
2339   Strike off this score of absence. Sweet {Bianca}
2340   Take me this worke out.
2341   <S {Bianca}.> Oh {Cassio}, whence came this?
2342   This is some Token from a newer Friend,
2343   To the felt- Absence: now I feele a Cause:
2344   Is't come to this? Well, well.
2345   <S {Cassio}.> Go #too, woman:
2346   Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,
2347   From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,
2348   That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;
2349   No, in good troth {Bianca}.
2350   <S {Bian}.> Why, who's is it?
2351   <S {Cassio}.> I know not neither:
2352   I found it in my Chamber,
2353   I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded
2354   (As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:
2355   Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time.
2356   <S {Bian}.> Leaue you? Wherefore?
2357   <S {Cassio}.> I do attend heere on the Generall,
2358   And thinke it no addition, nor my wish
2359   To haue him see me woman'd.
2360   <S {Bian}.> Why, I pray you?
2361   <S {Cassio}.> Not that I loue you not.
2362   <S {Bian}.> But that you do not loue me.
2363   I pray you bring me on the way a little,
2364   And say, if I shall see you soone at night?
2365   <S {Cassio}.> 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
2366   For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone.
2367   <S {Bian}.> 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.
2368   <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
2369   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
2370   <D {Enter Othello, and Iago}.>
2371   <S {Iago}.> Will you thinke so?
2372   <S {Oth}.> Thinke so, {Iago?}
2373   <S {Iago}.> What, to kisse in priuate?
2374   <S {Oth}.> An vnauthoriz'd kisse?
2375   <S {Iago}.> Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,
2376   An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?
2377   <S {Oth}.> Naked in bed ({Iago}) and not meane harme?
2378   It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:
2379   They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,
2380  *The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen.
2381   <S {Iago}.> If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:
2382   But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe.
2383   <S {Oth}.> What then?
2384   <S {Iago}.> Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,
2385   She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man.
2386   <S {Oth}.> She is Protectresse of her honor too:
2387   May she giue that?
      <P vv1><C E>
2388   <S {Iago}.> Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,
2389   They haue it very oft, that haue it not.
2390   But for the Handkerchiefe.
2391  *<S {Othe}.> By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:
2392   Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,
2393   As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:
2394   Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe.
2395   <S {Iago}>. #I: what of that?
2396   <S {Othe}.> That's not so good now.
2397  *<S {Iag}.> What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?
2398   Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,
2399   Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,
2400   Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,
2401   Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse
2402   But they must blab.)
2403   <S {Oth}.> Hath he said any thing?
2404   <S {Iago}.> He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,
2405   No more then he'le vn- sweare.
2406   <S {Oth}.> What hath he said?
2407   <S {Iago}.> Why, that he did: I know not what he did.
2408   <S {Othe}.> What? What?
2409   <S {Iago}.> Lye.
2410   <S {Oth}.> With her?
2411   <S {Iago}.> With her? On her: what you will.
2412  *<S {Othe}.> Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,
2413  *when they be- lye- her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:
2414  *Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To con-fesse,
2415  *and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,
2416  *and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
2417  *inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
2418  *Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)
2419  *Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Hand-kerchiefe?
2420   O diuell. <D {Falls in a Traunce}.>
2421   <S {Iago}.> Worke on,
2422  *My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,
2423   And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,
2424   (All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?
2425   My Lord, I say: {Othello}.
2426   <D {Enter Cassio}.>
2427   How now {Cassio}?
2428   <S {Cas}.> What's the matter?
2429   <S {Iago}.> My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,
2430   This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday.
2431   <S {Cas}.> Rub him about the Temples.
2432   <S {Iago}.> The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:
2433   If not, he foames at mouth: and #by and by
2434   Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:
2435   Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,
2436   He will recouer straight: when he is gone,
2437   I would on great occasion, speake with you.
2438   How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?
2439   <S {Othe}.> Dost thou mocke me?
2440   <S {Iago}.> I mocke you not, by Heauen:
2441   Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man.
2442   <S {Othe}.> A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast.
2443  *<S {Iago}.> Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,
2444   And many a ciuill Monster.
2445   <S {Othe}.> Did he confesse it?
2446   <S {Iago}.> Good Sir, be a man:
2447   Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd
2448   May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,
2449   That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,
2450   Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.
2451   Oh, 'tis the spight of #hell, the Fiends Arch- mock,
2452   To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;
2453   And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,
2454   And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe.
2455   <S {Oth}.> Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine.
2456   <S {Iago}.> Stand you #a while apart,
2457   Confine your selfe but in a patient List,
2458  *Whil'st you were heere, o're- whelmed with your griefe
2459   (A passion most resulting such a man)
2460   {#Cassio} came hither: I shifted him away,
2461   And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,
2462   Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,
2463   The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,
2464  *And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes
2465   That dwell in euery Region of his face.
2466   For I will make him tell the Tale anew;
2467   Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
2468   He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.
2469   I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,
2470   Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,
2471   And nothing of a man.
2472   <S {Othe}.> Do'st thou heare, {Iago},
2473   I will be found most cunning in my Patience:
2474   But (do'st thou heare) most bloody.
2475   <S {Iago}.> That's not amisse,
2476   But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?
2477   Now will I question {Cassio} of {Bianca},
2478   A Huswife that by selling her desires
2479   Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature
2480   That dotes on {Cassio}, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague
2481   To be- guile many, and be be- guil'd by one)
2482   He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine
2483   From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.
2484   <D {Enter Cassio}.>
2485   As he shall smile, {Othello} shall go mad:
2486   And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue
2487   Poore {Cassio's} smiles, gestures, and light behauiours
2488   Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?
2489   <S {Cas}.> The worser, that you giue me the addition,
2490   Whose want euen killes me.
2491   <S {Iago}.> Ply {Desdemona} well, and you are sure on't:
2492   Now, if this Suit lay in {Bianca's} dowre,
2493   How quickely should you speed?
2494   <S {Cas}.> Alas poore Caitiffe.
2495   <S {Oth}.> Looke how he laughes already.
2496   <S {Iago}.> I neuer knew woman loue man so.
2497  *<S {Cas}.> Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me.
2498   <S {Oth}.> Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out.
2499   <S {Iago}.> Do you heare {Cassio}?
2500   <S {Oth}.> Now he importunes him
2501   To tell it o're: go #too, well said, well said.
2502   <S {Iago}.> She giues it out, that you shall marry her.
2503   Do you intend it?
2504   <S {Cas}.> Ha, ha, ha.
2505   <S {Oth}.> Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?
2506   <S {Cas}.> #I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare
2507   Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it
2508   So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha.
2509   <S {Oth}.> So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes.
2510   <S {Iago}.> Why the cry goes, that you marry her.
2511   <S {Cas}.> Prythee say true.
2512   <S {Iago}.> I am a very Villaine else.
2513   <S {Oth}.> Haue you scoar'd me? Well.
2514   <S {Cas}.> This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:
2515   She is perswaded I will marry her
2516  *Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise.
      <P vv1v>
2517   <S {Oth}.> {Iago} becomes me: now he begins the story.
2518  *<S {Cassio}.> She was heere euen now: she haunts me in e-uery
2519  *place. I was the other day talking on the Sea-banke
2520  *with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
2521   Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck.
2522  *<S {Oth}.> Crying oh deere {Cassio}, as it were: his iesture im-ports
2523   it.
2524   <S {Cassio}.> So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:
2525   So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha.
2526  *<S {Oth}.> Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Cham-ber:
2527  *oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
2528   shall throw it to.
2529   <S {Cassio}.> Well, I must leaue her companie.
2530   <S {Iago}.> Before me: looke where she comes.
2531   <D {Enter Bianca}.>
2532  *<S {Cas}.> 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
2533   What do you meane by this haunting of me?
2534  *<S {Bian}.> Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
2535  *did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
2536  *me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
2537  *out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
2538  *finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
2539  *This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?
2540  *There, giue it your Hobbey- horse, wheresoeuer you had
2541   it, Ile take out no worke on't.
2542   <S {Cassio}.> How now, my sweete {Bianca}?
2543   How now? How now?
2544  *<S {Othe}.> By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe.
2545  *<S {Bian}.> If you'le come to supper to night you may, if
2546  *you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.  <D {Exit}>
2547   <S {Iago}.> After her: after her.
2548   <S {Cas}.> I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else.
2549   <S {Iago}.> Will you sup there?
2550   <S {Cassio}.> Yes, I intend so.
2551  *<S {Iago}.> Well, I may chance to see you: for I would ve-ry
2552   faine speake with you.
2553   <S {Cas}.> Prythee come: will you?
2554   <S {Iago}.> Go #too; say no more.
2555   <S {Oth}.> How shall I murther him, {Iago}.
2556   <S {Iago}.> Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?
2557   <S {Oth}.> Oh, {Iago}.
2558   <S {Iago}.> And did you see the Handkerchiefe?
2559   <S {Oth}.> Was that mine?
2560  *<S {Iago}.> Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes
2561  *the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he
2562   hath giu'n it his whore.
2563   <S {Oth}.> I would haue him nine yeeres #a killing:
2564   A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?
2565   <S {Iago}.> Nay, you must forget that.
2566  *<S {Othello}.> #I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
2567  *night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
2568  *stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
2569  *hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Em-perours
2570   side, and command him Taskes.
2571   <S {Iago}.> Nay, that's not your way.
2572  *<S {Othe}.> Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
2573  *with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
2574  *sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plen-teous
2575   wit, and inuention?
2576   <S {Iago}.> She's the worse for all this.
2577   <S {Othe}.> Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:
2578   And then of so gentle a condition?
2579   <S {Iago}.> #I too gentle.
2580   <S {Othe}.> Nay that's certaine:
2581  *But yet the pitty of it, {Iago}: oh {Iago}, the pitty of it
2582   {#Iago}.
2583  *<S {Iago}.> If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
2584  *pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
2585   no body.
2586   <S {Oth}.> I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?
2587   <S {Iago}.> Oh, 'tis foule in her.
2588   <S {Oth}.> With mine Officer?
2589   <S {Iago}.> That's fouler.
2590  *<S {Othe}.> Get me some poyson, {Iago}, this night. Ile not
2591  *expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnpro-uide
2592   my mind againe: this night {Iago}.
2593  *<S {Iago}.> Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,
2594   Euen the bed she hath contaminated.
2595   <S {Oth}.> Good, good:
2596   The Iustice of it pleases: very good.
2597   <S {Iago}.> And for {Cassio}, let me be his vndertaker:
2598   You shall heare more by midnight.
2599   <D {Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants}.>
2600  *<S {Othe}.> Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?
2601   <S {Iago}.> I warrant something from Venice,
2602   'Tis {Lodouico}, this, comes from the Duke.
2603   See, your wife's with him.
2604   <S {Lodo}.> Saue you worthy Generall.
2605   <S {Othe}.> With all my heart Sir.
2606  *<S {Lod}.> The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you.
2607   <S {Othe}.> I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures.
2608   <S {Des}.> And what's the newes, good cozen {Lodouico}
2609   <S {Iago}.> I am very glad to see you Signior:
2610   Welcome to Cyprus.
2611   <S {Lod}.> I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant {Cassio}?
2612   <S {Iago}.> Liues Sir,
2613  *<S {Des}.> Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,
2614   An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well.
2615   <S {Othe}.> Are you sure of that?
2616   <S {Des}.> My Lord?
2617   <S {Othe}.> This faile you not to do, as you will===
2618   <S {Lod}.> He did not call: he's busie in the paper,
2619   Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and {Cassio}?
2620   <S {Des}.> A most vnhappy one: I would do much
2621   T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to {Cassio}.
2622   <S {Oth}.> Fire, and brimestone.
2623   <S {Des}.> My Lord.
2624   <S {Oth}.> Are you wise?
2625   <S {Des}.> What is he angrie?
2626   <S {Lod}.> May be the Letter mou'd him.
2627   For as I thinke, they do command him home,
2628   Deputing {Cassio} in his Gouernment.
2629   <S {Des}.> Trust me, I am glad on't.
2630   <S {Othe}.> Indeed?
2631   <S {Des}.> My Lord?
2632   <S {Othe}.> I am glad to see you mad.
2633   <S {Des}.> Why, sweete {Othello}?
2634   <S {Othe}.> Diuell.
2635   <S {Des}.> I haue not deseru'd this.
2636  *<S {Lod}.> My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,
2637   Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,
2638   Make her amends: she weepes.
2639   <S {Othe}.> Oh diuell, diuell:
2640   If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,
2641   Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:
2642   Out of my sight.
2643   <S {Des}.> I will not stay to offend you.
2644   <S {Lod}.> Truely obedient Lady:
2645   I do beseech your Lordship call her backe.
      <P vv2>
2646   <S {Othe}.> Mistris.
2647   <S {Des}.> My Lord.
2648   <S {Othe}.> What would you with her, Sir?
2649   <S {Lod}.> Who I, my Lord?
2650   <S {Othe}.> #I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:
2651   Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on
2652   And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.
2653   And she's obedient: as you say obedient.
2654   Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.
2655   Concerning this Sir, (oh well- painted passion)
2656   I am commanded home: get you away:
2657   Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,
2658   And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:
2659   {#Cassio} shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night
2660   I do entreat, that we may sup together.
2661   You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.
2662   Goates, and Monkeys.  <D {Exit}.>
2663  *<S {Lod}.> Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate
2664   Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature
2665   Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue
2666   The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance
2667   Could neither graze, nor pierce?
2668   <S {Iago}.> He is much chang'd.
2669   <S {Lod}.> Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?
2670   <S {Iago}.> He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.
2671   What he might be: if what he might, he is not,
2672   I would to heauen he were.
2673   <S {Lod}.> What? Strike his wife?
2674   <S {Iago}.> 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew
2675   That stroke would proue the worst.
2676   <S {Lod}.> Is it his vse?
2677   Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,
2678   And new create his fault?
2679   <S {Iago}.> Alas, alas:
2680   It is not honestie in me to speake
2681  *What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,
2682   And his owne courses will denote him so,
2683   That I may saue my speech: do but go after
2684   And marke how he continues.
2685   <S {Lod}.> I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2686   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2687   <D {Enter Othello and Aemilia}.>
2688   <S {Othe}.> You haue seene nothing then?
2689   <S {Aemil}.> Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect.
2690   <S {Othe}.> Yes, you haue seene {Cassio}, and she together.
2691   <S {Aemi}.> But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,
2692   Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them.
2693   <S {Othe}.> What? Did they neuer whisper?
2694   <S {Aemil}.> Neuer my Lord.
2695   <S {Othe}.> Nor send you out o'th' way?
2696   <S {Aemil}.> Neuer.
2697  *<S {Othe}.> To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor no-|(thing?
2698   <S {Aemil}.> Neuer my Lord.
2699   <S {Othe}.> That's strange.
2700   <S {Aemil}.> I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:
2701   Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,
2702   Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:
2703   If any wretch haue put this in your head,
2704   Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,
2705   For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
2706   There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues
2707   Is foule as Slander.
2708   <S {Othe}.> Bid her come hither: go.  <D {Exit Aemilia}.>
2709   She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud
2710   That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:
2711   A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,
2712   And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.
2713   <D {Enter Desdemona, and Aemilia}.>
2714   <S {Des}.> My Lord, what is your #will?
2715   <S {Othe}.> Pray you Chucke come hither.
2716   <S {Des}.> What is your pleasure?
2717   <S {Oth}.> Let me see your eyes: looke in my face.
2718   <S {Des}.> What horrible Fancie's this?
2719   <S {Othe}.> Some of your Function Mistris:
2720   Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:
2721   Cough, or cry hem; if any body come:
2722   Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.  <D {Exit Aemi}.>
2723   <S {Des}.> Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?
2724   I vnderstand a Fury in your words.
2725   <S {Othe}.> Why? What art thou?
2726  *<S {Des}.> Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife.
2727  *<S {Othello}.> Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least
2728  *being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should
2729  *feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare
2730   thou art honest.
2731   <S {Des}.> Heauen doth truely know it.
2732  *<S {Othe}.> Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as #hell.
2733   <S {Des}.> To whom my Lord?
2734   With whom? How am I false?
2735   <S {Othe}.> Ah {Desdemon}, away, away, away.
2736   <S {Des}.> Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?
2737   Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?
2738   If happely you my Father do suspect,
2739   An Instrument of this your calling backe,
2740   Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,
2741   I haue lost him too.
2742   <S {Othe}.> Had it pleas'd Heauen,
2743   To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd
2744   All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare- head:
2745   Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.
2746   Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,
2747   I should haue found in some place of my Soule
2748   A drop of patience. But alas, to make me
2749   The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,
2750   To point his slow, and mouing finger at.
2751   Yet could I beare that too, well, very well:
2752   But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,
2753   Where either I must liue, or beare no life,
2754   The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,
2755   Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence,
2756   Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades
2757   To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:
2758   Patience, thou young and Rose- lip'd Cherubin,
2759   I heere looke grim as #hell.
2760   <S {Des}.> I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest.
2761   <S {Othe}.> Oh #I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,
2762   That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:
2763   Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,
2764   That the Sense akes at thee,
2765   Would thou had'st neuer bin borne.
2766   <S {Des}.> Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?
2767  *<S {Othe}.> Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke
2768   Made to write Whore vpon? What commited,
      <P vv2v>
2769   Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,
2770   I should make very Forges of my cheekes,
2771   That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,
2772   Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited?
2773   Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:
2774   The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,
2775   Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth
2776   And will not hear't. What commited?
2777   <S {Des}.> By Heauen you do me wrong.
2778   <S {Othe}.> Are not you a Strumpet?
2779   <S {Des}.> No, as I am a Christian.
2780   If to preserue this vessell for my Lord,
2781   From any other foule vnlawfull touch
2782   Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none.
2783   <S {Othe}.> What, not a Whore?
2784   <S {Des}.> No, as I shall be sau'd.
2785   <S {Othe}.> Is't possible?
2786   <S {Des}.> Oh Heauen forgiue vs.
2787   <S {Othe}.> I cry you mercy then.
2788   I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,
2789   That married with {Othello}. You Mistris,
2790   <D {Enter Aemilia}.>
2791   That haue the office opposite to Saint {Peter},
2792   And keepes the gate of #hell. You, you: #I you.
2793  *We haue done our course: there's money for your paines:
2794   I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.  <D {Exit}.>
2795   <S {Aemil}.> Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?
2796   How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?
2797   <S {Des}.> Faith, halfe #a sleepe.
2798   <S {Aemi}.> Good Madam,
2799   What's the matter with my Lord?
2800   <S {Des}.> With who?
2801   <S {Aemil}.> Why, with my Lord, Madam?
2802   <S {Des}.> Who is thy Lord?
2803   <S {Aemil}.> He that is yours, sweet Lady.
2804   <S {Des}.> I haue none: do not talke to me, {Aemilia},
2805   I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,
2806   But what should go by water. Prythee to night,
2807   Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,
2808   And call thy husband hither.
2809   <S {Aemil}.> Heere's a change indeed.  <D {Exit}.>
2810   <S {Des}.> 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.
2811   How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke
2812   The small'st opinion on my least misvse?
2813   <D {Enter Iago, and Aemilia}.>
2814   <S {Iago}.> What is your pleasure Madam?
2815   How is't with you?
2816   <S {Des}.> I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes
2817   Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.
2818   He might haue chid me so; for in good faith
2819   I am a Child to chiding.
2820   <S {Iago}.> What is the matter Lady?
2821   <S {Aemil}.> Alas ({Iago}) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,
2822   Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her
2823   That true hearts cannot beare it.
2824   <S {Des}.> Am I that name, {Iago}?
2825   <S {Iago}.> What name, (faire Lady?)
2826   <S {Des}.> Such as she said my Lord did say I was.
2827  *<S {Aemil}.> He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:
2828   Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet.
2829   <S {Iago}.> Why did he so?
2830   <S {Des}.> I do not know: I am sure I am none such.
2831   <S {Iago}.> Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.
2832  *<S {Aemil}.> Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?
2833   Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?
2834   To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?
2835   <S {Des}.> It is my wretched Fortune.
2836   <S {Iago}.> Beshrew him for't:
2837   How comes this Tricke vpon him?
2838   <S {Des}.> Nay, Heauen doth know.
2839   <S {Aemi}.> I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,
2840   Some busie and insinuating Rogue,
2841   Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,
2842   Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else.
2843   <S {Iago}.> Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible.
2844   <S {Des}.> If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.
2845   <S {Aemil}.> A halter pardon him:
2846   And #hell gnaw his bones.
2847   Why should he call her Whore?
2848   Who keepes her companie?
2849   What Place? What Time?
2850   What Forme? What liklyhood?
2851   The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,
2852   Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.
2853   Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,
2854   And put in euery honest hand a whip
2855   To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,
2856   Euen from the East to th' West.
2857   <S {Iago}.> Speake within doore.
2858  *<S {Aemil}.> Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was
2859   That turn'd your wit, the seamy- side without,
2860   And made you to suspect me with the Moore.
2861   <S {Iago}.> You are a Foole: go #too.
2862   <S {Des}.> Alas {Iago},
2863   What shall I do to win my Lord againe?
2864   Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,
2865   I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:
2866   If ere my #will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,
2867   Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,
2868   Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence
2869   Delighted them: or any other Forme.
2870   Or that I do not yet, and euer did,
2871   And euer will, (though he do shake me off
2872   To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,
2873   Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,
2874   And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,
2875   But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,
2876   It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,
2877   To do the Act, that might the addition earne,
2878   Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me.
2879   <S {Iago}.> I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:
2880   The businesse of the State do's him offence.
2881   <S {Des}.> If 'twere no other.
2882   <S {Iago}.> It is but so, I warrant,
2883   Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:
2884   The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,
2885   Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.
2886   <D {Exeunt Desdemona and Aemilia}.>
2887   <D {Enter Rodorigo}.>
2888   How now {Rodorigo}?
2889   <S {Rod}.> I do not finde
2890   That thou deal'st iustly with me.
2891   <S {Iago}.> What in the contrarie?
2892  *<S {Rodori}.> Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
2893  *{#Iago}, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
2894  *me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least ad-uantage
2895  *of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
2896  *am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
2897   haue foolishly suffred.
2898   <S {Iago}.> Will you heare me {Rodorigo}?
      <P vv3>
2899  *<S {Rodori}.> I haue heard too much: and your words and
2900   Performances are no kin together.
2901   <S {Iago}.> You charge me most vniustly.
2902  *<S {Rodo}.> With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
2903  *selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
2904  *me to deliuer {Desdemona}, would halfe haue corrupted a
2905  *Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
2906  *and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
2907   respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none.
2908   <S {Iago}.> Well, go #too: very well.
2909  *<S {Rod}.> Very well, go #too: I cannot go #too, (man) nor
2910  *'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
2911   finde my selfe fopt in it.
2912   <S {Iago}.> Very well.
2913  *<S {Rodor}.> I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
2914  *selfe knowne to {Desdemona}. If she will returne me my
2915  *Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlaw-full
2916  *solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
2917   satisfaction of you.
2918   <S {Iago}.> You haue said now.
2919  *<S {Rodo}.> #I: and said nothing but what I protest intend-ment
2920   of doing.
2921  *<S {Iago}.> Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
2922  *euen from this instant do build on thee a better o-pinion
2923  *then euer before: giue me thy hand {Rodorigo}.
2924  *Thou hast taken against me a most iust excepti-on:
2925  *but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
2926   Affaire.
2927   <S {Rod}.> It hath not appeer'd.
2928  *<S {Iago}.> I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
2929  *your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
2930  *But {Rodorigo}, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
2931  *I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
2932  *meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
2933  *shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
2934  *{Desdemona}, take me from this world with Treache-rie,
2935   and deuise Engines for my life.
2936  *<S {Rod}.> Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and com-passe?
2937  _
2938  *<S {Iago}.> Sir, there is especiall Commission come from
2939   Venice to depute {Cassio} in {Othello's} place.
2940  *<S {Rod}.> Is that true? Why then {Othello} and {Desdemona}
2941   returne againe to Venice.
2942  *<S {Iago}.> Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
2943  *away with him the faire {Desdemona}, vnlesse his a-bode
2944  *be lingred heere by some accident. Where-in
2945  *none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
2946   {Cassio}.
2947   <S {Rod}.> How do you meane remouing him?
2948  *<S {Iago}.> Why, by making him vncapable of {Othello's}
2949   place: knocking out his braines.
2950   <S {Rod}.> And that you would haue me to do.
2951  *<S {Iago}.> #I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
2952  *right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
2953  *will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
2954  *Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
2955  *I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
2956  *you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
2957  *to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
2958  *vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
2959  *me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
2960  *you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
2961  *is now high supper time: and the night growes to #wast.
2962   About it.
2963   <S {Rod}.> I will heare further reason for this.
2964   <S {Iago}.> And you shalbe satisfi'd.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2965   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2966   <D {Enter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, Aemilia},
2967   {and Atendants}.>
2968  *<S {Lod}.> I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further.
2969   <S {Oth}.> Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke.
2970  *<S {Lodoui}.> Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your
2971   Ladyship.
2972   <S {Des}.> Your Honour is most welcome.
2973   <S {Oth}.> Will you walke Sir? Oh {Desdemona}.
2974   <S {Des}.> My Lord.
2975  *<S {Othello}.> Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be re-turn'd
2976  *forthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't
2977   be done.  <D {Exit}.>
2978   <S {Des}.> I will my Lord.
2979  *<S {Aem}.> How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did.
2980   <S {Des}.> He saies he will returne incontinent,
2981   And hath commanded me to go to bed,
2982   And bid me to dismisse you.
2983   <S {Aemi}.> Dismisse me?
2984   <S {Des}.> It was his bidding: therefore good {Aemilia},
2985   Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
2986   We must not now displease him.
2987   <S {Aemil}.> I, would you had neuer seene him.
2988   <S {Des}.> So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,
2989   That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,
2990   (Prythee vn- pin me) haue grace and fauour.
2991  *<S {Aemi}.> I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed.
2992  *<S {Des}.> All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?
2993   If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me
2994   In one of these same Sheetes.
2995   <S {Aemil}.> Come, come: you talke.
2996   <S {Des}.> My Mother had a Maid call'd {Barbarie},
2997   She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,
2998   And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,
2999   An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,
3000   And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,
3001   Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do,
3002   But to go hang my head all at one side
3003   And sing it like poore {Barbarie}: prythee dispatch.
3004   <S {Aemi}.> Shall I go fetch your Night- gowne?
3005   <S {Des}.> No, vn- pin me here,
3006   This {Lodouico} is a proper man.
3007   <S {Aemil}.> A very handsome man.
3008   <S {Des}.> He speakes well.
3009  *<S {Aemil}.> I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd
3010   barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
3011   <S {Des}.> {The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree}.
3012   {Sing all a greene Willough}:
3013   {Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee},
3014   {Sing Willough, Willough, Willough}.
3015   {The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes}
3016   {Sing Willough, &c}.
3017   {Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones},
3018   {Sing Willough, &c}.  (Lay by these)
3019  *{Willough, Willough}. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)
3020   {Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland}.
3021   {Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue}.
3022   (Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?
3023   <S {Aemil}.> It's the wind.
3024  *<S {Des}.> {I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then}?
3025   {Sing Willough, &c}.
3026   {If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men}.
      <P vv3v><C B>
3027   So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:
3028   Doth that boade weeping?
3029   <S {Aemil}.> 'Tis neyther heere, nor there.
3030  *<S {Des}.> I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!
3031   Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me {Aemilia})
3032   That there be women do abuse their husbands
3033   In such grosse kinde?
3034   <S {Aemil}.> There be some such, no question.
3035  *<S {Des}.> Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?
3036   <S {Aemil}.> Why, would not you?
3037   <S {Des}.> No, by this Heauenly light.
3038   <S {Aemil}.> Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:
3039   I might doo't as well i'th' darke.
3040  *<S {Des}.> Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?
3041   <S {Aemil}.> The world's a huge thing:
3042   It is a great price, for a small vice.
3043   <S {Des}.> Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
3044  *<S {Aemil}.> Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
3045  *I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
3046  *ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
3047  *Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
3048  *all the whole world: why, who would not make her hus-band
3049  *a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should ven-ture
3050   Purgatory for't.
3051   <S {Des}.> Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
3052   For the whole world.
3053  *<S {Aemil}.> Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;
3054  *and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
3055  *your owne world, and you might quickly make it right.
3056   <S {Des}.> I do not thinke there is any such woman.
3057  *<S {Aemil}.> Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as
3058   would store the world they plaid for.
3059   But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults
3060   If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,
3061   And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;
3062   Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,
3063   Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,
3064   Or scant our former hauing in despight)
3065  *Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,
3066   Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,
3067   Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,
3068   And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,
3069   As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,
3070   When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?
3071   I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?
3072   I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?
3073   It is so too. And haue not we Affections?
3074   Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?
3075   Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,
3076   The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so.
3077   <S {Des}.> Good night, good night:
3078   Heauen me such vses send,
3079  *Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.  <D {Exeunt}>
3080   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
3081   <D {Enter Iago, and Rodorigo}.>
3082   <S {Iago}.> Heere, stand behinde this Barke,
3083   Straight will he come:
3084   Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:
3085   Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,
3086   It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,
3087   And fixe most firme thy Resolution.
3088   <S {Rod}.> Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't.
3089  *<S {Iago}.> Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand.
3090   <S {Rod}.> I haue no great deuotion to the deed,
3091   And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:
3092   'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies.
3093  *<S {Iago}.> I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,
3094   And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill {Cassio},
3095   Or {Cassio} him, or each do kill the other,
3096   Euery way makes my gaine. Liue {Rodorigo},
3097   He calles me to a restitution large
3098   Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,
3099   As Guifts to {Desdemona}.
3100   It must not be: If {Cassio} do remaine,
3101   He hath a dayly beauty in his life,
3102   That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore
3103   May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:
3104   No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.
3105   <D {Enter Cassio}.>
3106   <S {Rod}.> I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest.
3107   <S {Cas}.> That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,
3108   But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:
3109   I will make proofe of thine.
3110   <S {Rod}.> Oh, I am slaine.
3111   <S {Cassio}.> I am maym'd for euer:
3112   Helpe hoa: Murther, murther.
3113   <D {Enter Othello}.>
3114   <S {Oth}.> The voyce of {Cassio}. {Iago} keepes his word.
3115   <S {Rod}.> O Villaine that I am.
3116   <S {Oth}.> It is euen so.
3117   <S {Cas}.> Oh helpe hoa: Light, a Surgeon.
3118   <S {Oth}.> 'Tis he: O braue {Iago}, honest, and iust,
3119   That hast such Noble sense of thy Friends wrong,
3120   Thou teachest me. Minion, your deere lyes dead,
3121   And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:
3122  *For of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted.
3123  *Thy Bed lust- stain'd, shall with Lusts blood bee spotted.
3124   <D {Exit Othello}.>
3125   <D {Enter Lodouico and Gratiano}.>
3126   <S {Cas}.> What hoa? no Watch? No passage?
3127   Murther, Murther.
3128   <S {Gra}.> 'Tis some mischance, the voyce is very direfull.
3129   <S {Cas}.> Oh helpe.
3130   <S {Lodo}.> Hearke.
3131   <S {Rod}.> Oh wretched Villaine.
3132   <S {Lod}.> Two or three groane. 'Tis heauy night;
3133   These may be counterfeits: Let's think't vnsafe
3134   To come into the cry, without more helpe.
3135   <S {Rod}.> Nobody come: then shall I bleed to death.
3136   <D {Enter Iago}.>
3137   <S {Lod}.> Hearke.
3138  *<S {Gra}.> Here's one comes in his shirt, with Light, and
3139   Weapons.
3140   <S {Iago}.> Who's there?
3141   Who's noyse is this that cries on murther?
3142   <S {Lodo}.> We do not know.
3143   <S {Iago}.> Do not you heare a cry?
3144   <S {Cas}.> Heere, heere: for heauen sake helpe me.
3145   <S {Iago}.> What's the matter?
3146   <S {Gra}.> This is {Othello's} Ancient, as I take it.
3147   <S {Lodo}.> The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow.
3148   <S {Iago}.> What are you heere, that cry so greeuously?
3149   <S {Cas}.> {Iago}? Oh I am spoyl'd, vndone by Villaines:
3150   Giue me some helpe.
3151   <S {Iago}.> O mee, Lieutenant!
3152   What Villaines haue done this?
3153   <S {Cas}.> I thinke that one of them is heereabout.
      <P vv4>
3154   And cannot make away.
3155   <S {Iago}.> Oh treacherous Villaines:
3156   What are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe.
3157   <S {Rod}.> O helpe me there.
3158   <S {Cassio}.> That's one of them.
3159   <S {Iago}.> Oh murd'rous Slaue! O Villaine!
3160   <S {Rod}.> O damn'd {Iago}! O inhumane Dogge!
3161   <S {Iago}.> Kill men i'th' darke?
3162   Where be these bloody Theeues?
3163   How silent is this Towne? Hoa, murther, murther.
3164   What may you be? Are you of good, or euill?
3165   <S {Lod}.> As you shall proue vs, praise vs.
3166   <S {Iago}.> Signior {Lodouico}?
3167   <S {Lod}.> He Sir.
3168  *<S {Iago}.> I cry you mercy: here's {Cassio} hurt by Villaines.
3169   <S {Gra}.> {Cassio}?
3170   <S {Iago}.> How is't Brother?
3171   <S {Cas}.> My Legge is cut in two.
3172   <S {Iago}.> Marry heauen forbid:
3173   Light Gentlemen, Ile binde it with my shirt.
3174   <D {Enter Bianca}.>
3175   <S {Bian}.> What is the matter hoa? Who is't that cry'd?
3176   <S {Iago}.> Who is't that cry'd?
3177   <S {Bian}.> Oh my deere {Cassio},
3178   My sweet {Cassio}: Oh {Cassio, Cassio, Cassio}.
3179   <S {Iago}.> O notable Strumpet. {Cassio}, may you suspect
3180   Who they should be, that haue thus mangled you?
3181   <S {Cas}.> No.
3182   <S {Gra}.> I am sorry to finde you thus;
3183   I haue beene to seeke you.
3184   <S {Iago}.> Lend me a Garter. So: === Oh for a Chaire
3185   To beare him easily hence.
3186   <S {Bian}.> Alas he faints. Oh {Cassio, Cassio, Cassio}.
3187   <S {Iago}.> Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash
3188   To be a party in this Iniurie.
3189   Patience awhile, good {Cassio}. Come, come;
3190   Lend me a Light: know we this face, or no?
3191   Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman
3192   {#Rodorigo}? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis {Rodorigo}.
3193   <S {Gra}.> What, of Venice?
3194   <S {Iago}.> Euen he Sir: Did you know him?
3195   <S {Gra}.> Know him? #I.
3196   <S {Iago}.> Signior {Gratiano}? I cry your gentle pardon:
3197   These bloody accidents must excuse my Manners,
3198   That so neglected you.
3199   <S {Gra}.> I am glad to see you.
3200   <S {Iago}.> How do you {Cassio}? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire.
3201   <S {Gra}.> {Rodorigo}?
3202   <S {Iago}.> He, he, 'tis he:
3203   Oh that's well said, the Chaire.
3204   Some good man beare him carefully from hence,
3205   Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,
3206   Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere ({Cassio})
3207  *Was my deere friend. What malice was between you.
3208   <S {Cas}.> None in the world: nor do I know the man?
3209  *<S {Iago}.> What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.
3210   Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?
3211   Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?
3212   Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.
3213   Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:
3214   Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake
3215   Though tongues were out of vse.
3216   <S {Aemil}.> Alas, what is the matter?
3217   What is the matter, Husband?
3218   <S {Iago}.> {Cassio} hath heere bin set on in the darke
3219   By {Rodorigo}, and Fellowes that are scap'd:
3220   He's almost slaine, and {Rodorigo} quite dead.
3221   <S {Aemil}.> Alas good Gentleman: alas good {Cassio}.
3222  *<S {Iago}.> This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe {Aemilia},
3223   Go know of {Cassio} where he supt to night.
3224   What, do you shake at that?
3225  *<S {Bian}.> He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not.
3226   <S {Iago}.> O did he so? I charge you go with me.
3227   <S {Aemil}.> Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet.
3228   <S {Bian}.> I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,
3229   As you that thus abuse me.
3230   <S {Aemil}.> As I? Fie vpon thee.
3231   <S {Iago}.> Kinde Gentlemen:
3232   Let's go see poore {Cassio} drest.
3233   Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.
3234   {Aemilia}, run you to the Cittadell,
3235   And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:
3236   Will you go on afore? This is the night
3237   That either makes me, or foredoes me quight.  <D {Exeunt}>
3238   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
3239   <D {Enter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed}.>
3240   <S {Oth}.> It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)
3241   Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,
3242   It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,
3243   Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,
3244   And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:
3245   Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:
3246   Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:
3247   If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,
3248   I can againe thy former light restore,
3249   Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,
3250   Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,
3251   I know not where is that {Promethaean} heate
3252   That can thy Light re- Lume.
3253   When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,
3254   I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,
3255   It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.
3256   Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade
3257   Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:
3258   Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
3259   And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.
3260   So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,
3261   But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,
3262   It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes.
3263   <S {Des}.> Who's there? {Othello}?
3264   <S {Othel}.> #I {Desdemona}.
3265   <S {Des}.> Will you come to bed, my Lord?
3266   <S {Oth}.> Haue you pray'd to night, {Desdemon}?
3267   <S {Des}.> #I my Lord.
3268   <S {Oth}.> If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime
3269   Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,
3270   Solicite for it straight.
3271   <S {Des}.> Alacke, my Lord,
3272   What may you meane by that?
3273   <S {Oth}.> Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:
3274   I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,
3275   No, Heauens fore- fend) I would not kill thy Soule.
3276   <S {Des}.> Talke you of killing?
3277   <S {Oth}.> #I, I do.
3278   <S {Des}.> Then Heauen haue mercy on mee.
      <P vv4v>
3279   <S {Oth}.> Amen, with all my heart.
3280   <S {Des}.> If you say, I hope you will not kill me.
3281   <S {Oth}.> Humh.
3282   <S {Des}.> And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then
3283   When your eyes rowle so.
3284   Why I should feare, I know not,
3285   Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare.
3286   <S {Oth}.> Thinke on thy sinnes.
3287   <S {Des}.> They are Loues I beare to you.
3288   <S {Oth}.> #I, and for that thou dy'st.
3289   <S {Des}.> That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.
3290   Alas, why gnaw you so your nether- lip?
3291   Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:
3292   These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
3293   They do not point on me.
3294   <S {Oth}.> Peace, and be still.
3295   <S {Des}.> I will so: What's the matter?
3296   <S {Oth}.> That Handkerchiefe
3297   Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to {Cassio}.
3298   <S {Des}.> No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,
3299   And aske him.
3300   <S {Oth}.> Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,
3301   Thou art on thy death- bed.
3302   <S {Des}.> #I, but not yet to dye.
3303   <S {Oth}.> Presently.
3304   Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:
3305   For to deny each Article with Oath,
3306   Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception
3307   That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye.
3308   <S {Des}.> O Heauen haue mercy on me.
3309   <S {Oth}.> I say, Amen.
3310   <S {Des}.> And haue you mercy too. I neuer did
3311   Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd {Cassio},
3312   But with such generall warrantie of Heauen,
3313   As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token.
3314   <S {Oth}.> By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.
3315   O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,
3316   And makes me call, what I intend to do,
3317   A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.
3318   I saw the Handkerchiefe.
3319   <S {Des}.> He found it then:
3320   I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:
3321   Let him confesse a truth.
3322   <S {Oth}.> He hath confest.
3323   <S {Des}.> What, my Lord?
3324   <S {Oth}.> That he hath vs'd thee.
3325   <S {Des}.> How? vnlawfully?
3326   <S {Oth}.> #I.
3327   <S {Des}.> He will not say so.
3328   <S {Oth}.> No: his mouth is stopp'd:
3329   Honest {Iago} hath 'tane order for't.
3330   <S {Des}.> Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?
3331   <S {Oth}.> Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge
3332   Had stomacke for them all.
3333   <S {Des}.> Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone.
3334  *<S {Oth}.> Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?
3335   <S {Des}.> O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not.
3336   <S {Oth}.> Downe Strumpet.
3337   <S {Des}.> Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night.
3338   <S {Oth}.> Nay, if you striue.
3339   <S {Des}.> But halfe an houre.
3340   <S {Oth}.> Being done, there is no pawse.
3341   <S {Des}.> But while I say one prayer.
3342   <S {Oth}.> It is too late.  <D {Smothers her}.>
3343   <D {Aemilia at the doore}.>
3344   <S {Aemil}.> My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?
3345   My Lord, my Lord.
3346  *<S {Oth}.> What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
3347   I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,
3348   I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?
3349   So, so.
3350   <S {Aemil}. {within}.> What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?
3351   <S {Oth}.> Who's there?
3352  *<S {Aemil}.> Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word
3353   with you.
3354   <S {Oth}.> Yes: 'Tis {Aemilia}: #by and by. Shee's dead.
3355   'Tis like she comes to speake of {Cassio's} death:
3356   The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?
3357   Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? #Wer't good?
3358   I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?
3359   If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:
3360   My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.
3361   Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!
3362   Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse
3363   Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe
3364   Did yawne at Alteration.
3365   <S {Aemil}.> I do beseech you
3366   That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord.
3367   <S {Oth}.> I had forgot thee: oh come in {Aemilia}.
3368   Soft, #by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.
3369   Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now?
3370   <D {Enter Aemilia}.>
3371  *<S {Aemil}.> Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers
3372   done.
3373   <S {Oth}.> What? now?
3374   <S {Aemil}.> But now, my Lord.
3375   <S {Oth}.> It is the very error of the Moone,
3376   She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,
3377   And makes men mad.
3378   <S {Aemil}.> {Cassio}, my Lord, hath kill'd
3379   A young Venetian, call'd {Rodorigo}.
3380   <S {Oth}.> {Rodorigo} kill'd? and {Cassio} kill'd?
3381   <S {Aemil}.> No, {Cassio} is not kill'd.
3382   <S {Oth}.> Not {Cassio} kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,
3383   And sweet Reuenge growes harsh.
3384   <S {Des}.> O falsely, falsely murder'd.
3385   <S {Aemil}.> Alas! what cry is that?
3386   <S {Oth}.> That? What?
3387   <S {Aemil}.> Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.
3388   Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,
3389   Sweet {Desdemona}, oh sweet Mistris, speake.
3390   <S {Des}.> A guiltlesse death, I dye.
3391   <S {Aemil}.> Oh who hath done this deed?
3392   <S {Des}.> No body: I my selfe, farewell:
3393   Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell.
3394   <S {Oth}.> Why, how should she be murdred?
3395   <S {Aemil}.> Alas: who knowes?
3396   <S {Oth}.> You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.
3397   <S {Aemil}.> She said so: I must needs report the truth.
3398   <S {Oth}.> She's like a Liar gone to burning #hell,
3399   'Twas I that kill'd her.
3400  *<S {Aemil}.> Oh the more Angell she, and you the black-er
3401   Diuell.
3402   <S {Oth}.> She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.
3403   <S {Aemil}.> Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell.
3404   <S {Oth}.> She was false as water.
3405   <S {Aemil}.> Thou art rash as fire, to say
3406   That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true.
3407   <S {Oth}.> {Cassio} did top her: Ask thy husband else.
3408   O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in #hell:
3409   But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds
3410   To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.
      <P vv5>
3411   <S {Aemil}.> My Husband?
3412   <S {Oth}.> Thy Husband.
3413   <S {Aemil}.> That she was false to Wedlocke?
3414   <S {Oth}.> #I, with {Cassio}: had she bin true,
3415   If Heauen would make me such another world,
3416   Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,
3417   I'ld not haue sold her for it.
3418   <S {Aemil}.> My Husband?
3419   <S {Oth}.> #I, 'twas he that told me on her first,
3420   An honest man he is, and hates the slime
3421   That stickes on filthy deeds.
3422   <S {Aemil}.> My Husband?
3423   <S {Oth}.> What needs this itterance, Woman?
3424   I say, thy Husband.
3425   <S {Aemil}.> Oh Mistris,
3426   Villany hath made mockes with loue:
3427   My Husband say she was false?
3428   <S {Oth}.> He, Woman;
3429   I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?
3430   My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest {Iago}.
3431   <S {Aemil}.> If he say so, may his pernicious Soule
3432   Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,
3433   She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine.
3434   <S {Oth}.> Hah?
3435   <S {Aemil}.> Do thy worst:
3436   This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,
3437   Then thou was't worthy her.
3438   <S {Oth}.> Peace, you were best.
3439   <S {Aemil}.> Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,
3440   As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,
3441   As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed
3442   (I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,
3443   Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:
3444   The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.
3445   <D {Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago}.>
3446   <S {Mon}.> What is the matter? How now Generall?
3447  *<S {Aemil}.> Oh, are you come, {Iago}: you haue done well,
3448   That men must lay their Murthers on your necke.
3449   <S {Gra}.> What is the matter?
3450   <S {Aemil}.> Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:
3451   He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:
3452   I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.
3453   Speake, for my heart is full.
3454   <S {Iago}.> I told him what I thought,
3455   And told no more
3456   Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.
3457   <S {Aemil}.> But did you euer tell him,
3458   She was false?
3459   <S {Iago}.> I did.
3460   <S {Aemil}.> You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:
3461   Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.
3462   Shee false with {Cassio}?
3463   Did you say with {Cassio}?
3464   <S {Iago}.> With {Cassio}, Mistris?
3465   Go #too, charme your tongue.
3466   <S {Emil}.> I will not charme my Tongue;
3467   I am bound to speake,
3468   My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed.
3469   <S {All}.> Oh Heauens, forefend.
3470   <S {Emil}.> And your reports haue set the Murder on.
3471   <S {Othello}.> Nay stare not Masters,
3472   It is true indeede.
3473   <S {Gra}.> 'Tis a strange Truth.
3474   <S {Mont}.> O monstrous Acte.
3475   <S {Emil}.> Villany, villany, villany:
3476   I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:
3477   I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.
3478   O villany! villany!
3479   <S {Iago}.> What, are you mad?
3480   I charge you get you home.
3481  *<S {Emil}.> Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:
3482   'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:
3483   Perchance {Iago}, I will ne're go home.
3484   <S {Oth}.> Oh, oh, oh.
3485   <S {Emil}.> Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:
3486   For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,
3487   That ere did lift vp eye.
3488   <S {Oth}.> Oh she was fowle!
3489   I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,
3490  *Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:
3491   I know this acte shewes horrible and grim.
3492   <S {Gra}.> Poore {Desdemon}:
3493   I am glad thy Father's dead,
3494   Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe
3495   Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,
3496   This sight would make him do a desperate turne:
3497   Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,
3498   And fall to Reprobance.
3499   <S {Oth}.> 'Tis pittifull: but yet {Iago} knowes
3500   That she with {Cassio}, hath the Act of shame
3501   A thousand times committed. {Cassio} confest it,
3502   And she did gratifie his amorous workes
3503   With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue
3504   Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:
3505   It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token
3506   My Father gaue my Mother.
3507   <S {Emil}.> Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!
3508   <S {Iago}.> Come, hold your peace.
3509   <S {Emil}.> 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?
3510   No, I will speake as liberall as the North;
3511   Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,
3512   All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake.
3513   <S {Iago}.> Be wise, and get you home.
3514   <S {Emil}.> I will not.
3515   <S {Gra}.> Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman.
3516   <S {Emil}.> Oh thou dull Moore,
3517   That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of
3518   I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:
3519   For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,
3520   (More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)
3521   He begg'd of me, to steale't.
3522   <S {Iago}.> Villanous Whore.
3523   <S {Emil}.> She giue it {Cassio}? No, alas I found it,
3524   And I did giu't my Husband.
3525   <S {Iago}.> Filth, thou lyest.
3526   <S {Emil}.> By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:
3527   Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole
3528   Do with so good a wife?
3529   <S {Oth}.> Are there no stones in Heauen,
3530   But what serues for the Thunder?
3531   Precious Villaine.
3532   <S {Gra}.> The woman falles:
3533   Sure he hath kill'd his Wife.
3534   <S {Emil}.> #I, #I: oh lay me by my Mistris side.
3535   <S {Gra}.> Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
3536  *<S {Mon}.> 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon
3537   Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:
3538   Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,
3539   But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,
3540   For 'tis a damned Slaue.  <D {Exit}.>
      <P vv5v>
3541   <S {Oth}.> I am not valiant neither:
3542   But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.
3543   But why should Honor out- liue Honesty?
3544   Let it go all.
3545   <S {Aemil}.> What did thy Song boad Lady?
3546   Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,
3547   And dye in Musicke: {Willough, Willough, Willough}.
3548   Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,
3549   So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:
3550   So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye.
3551   <S {Oth}.> I haue another weapon in this Chamber,
3552   It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:
3553   Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth.
3554   <S {Gra}.> If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;
3555   Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
3556   <S {Oth}.> Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,
3557   Or naked as I am I will assault thee.
3558   <S {Gra}.> What is the matter?
3559   <S {Othel}.> Behold, I haue a weapon:
3560   A better neuer did it selfe sustaine
3561   Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,
3562   That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,
3563   I haue made my way through more impediments
3564   Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)
3565   Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.
3566   Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:
3567   Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt
3568   And verie Sea- marke of my vtmost Saile.
3569   Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:
3570   Man but a Rush against {Othello's} brest,
3571   And he retires. Where should {Othello} go?
3572  *Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill- Starr'd wench,
3573   Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,
3574   This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,
3575   And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?
3576   Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!
3577   Whip me ye Diuels,
3578   From the possession of this Heauenly sight:
3579   Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,
3580   Wash me in steepe- downe gulfes of Liquid fire.
3581   Oh {Desdemon}! dead {Desdemon}: dead. Oh, oh!
3582   <D {Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago},
3583   {with Officers}.>
3584   <S {Lod}.> Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?
3585   <S {Oth}.> That's he that was {Othello}: heere I am.
3586   <S {Lod}.> Where is that Viper?
3587   Bring the Villaine forth.
3588  *<S {Oth}.> I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,
3589   If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee.
3590   <S {Lod}.> Wrench his Sword from him.
3591   <S {Iago}.> I bleed Sir, but not kill'd.
3592   <S {Othel}.> I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:
3593   For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die.
3594   <S {Lod}.> Oh thou {Othello}, that was once so good,
3595   Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,
3596   What shall be saide to thee.
3597   <S {Oth}.> Why any thing:
3598   An honourable Murderer, if you will:
3599   For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour.
3600   <S {Lod}.> This wretch hath part confest his Villany:
3601   Did you and he consent in {Cassio's} death.
3602   <S {Oth}.> #I.
3603   <S {Cas}.> Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause.
3604   <S {Oth}.> I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:
3605   Will you, I pray, demand that demy- Diuell,
3606   Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body.
3607  *<S {Iag}.> Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
3608   From this time forth, I neuer will speake word.
3609   <S {Lod}.> What? not to pray?
3610   <S {Gra}.> Torments will ope your lips.
3611   <S {Oth}.> Well, thou dost best.
3612   <S {Lod}.> Sir,
3613   You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,
3614   (Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter
3615   Found in the pocket of the slaine {Rodorigo},
3616   And heere another, the one of them imports
3617   The death of {Cassio}, to be vndertooke
3618   By {Rodorigo}.
3619   <S {Oth}.> O Villaine!
3620   <S {Cassio}.> Most Heathenish, and most grosse.
3621   <S {Lod}.> Now, heere's another discontented paper
3622   Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes
3623   {#Rodorigo} meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:
3624   But that (belike) {Iago} in the interim
3625   Came in, and satisfi'd him.
3626   <S {Oth}.> Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;
3627   How came you ({Cassio}) by that Handkerchiefe
3628   That was my wiues?
3629   <S {Cassio}.> I found it in my Chamber:
3630   And he himselfe confest it but euen now,
3631   That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,
3632   Which wrought to his desire.
3633   <S {Othel}.> O Foole, foole, foole!
3634   <S {Cassio}.> There is besides, in {Rodorigo's} Letter,
3635   How he vpbraides {Iago}, that he made him
3636   Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came
3637   That I was cast: and euen but now he spake
3638   (After long seeming dead) {Iago} hurt him,
3639   {#Iago} set him on.
3640   <S {Lod}.> You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:
3641   Your Power, and your Command is taken off,
3642   And {Cassio} rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,
3643   If there be any cunning Crueltie,
3644   That can torment him much, and hold him long,
3645   It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,
3646   Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne
3647   To the Venetian State. Come, bring away.
3648   <S {Oth}.> Soft you; a word or two before you goe:
3649   I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:
3650   No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,
3651   When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,
3652   Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,
3653   Nor set downe ought in malice.
3654   Then must you speake,
3655   Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:
3656   Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,
3657   Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand
3658   (Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away
3659   Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,
3660   Albeit vn- vsed to the melting moode,
3661   Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees
3662   Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:
3663   And say besides, that in {Aleppo} once,
3664   Where a malignant, and a Turbond- Turke
