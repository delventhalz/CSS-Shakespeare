2      <D {Enter Richard Duke of Gloster, solus}.>
3      Now is the Winter of our Discontent,
4     *Made glorious Summer by this Son of Yorke:
5     *And all the clouds that lowr'd vpon our house
6      In the deepe bosome of the Ocean buried.
7     *Now are our browes bound with Victorious Wreathes,
8      Our bruised armes hung vp for Monuments;
9      Our sterne Alarums chang'd to merry Meetings;
10     Our dreadfull Marches, to delightfull Measures.
11    *Grim- visag'd Warre, hath smooth'd his wrinkled Front:
12     And now, in stead of mounting Barbed Steeds,
13     To fright the Soules of fearfull Aduersaries,
14     He capers nimbly in a Ladies Chamber,
15     To the lasciuious pleasing of a Lute.
16     But I, that am not shap'd for sportiue trickes,
17     Nor made to court an amorous Looking- glasse:
18     I, that am Rudely stampt, and want loues Maiesty,
19     To strut before a wonton ambling Nymph:
20     I, that am curtail'd of this faire Proportion,
21     Cheated of Feature by dissembling Nature,
22     Deform'd, vn- finish'd, sent before my time
23     Into this breathing World, scarse halfe made vp,
24     And that so lamely and vnfashionable,
25     That dogges barke at me, as I halt by them.
26     Why I (in this weake piping time of Peace)
27     Haue no delight to passe away the time,
28     Vnlesse to see my Shadow in the Sunne,
29     And descant on mine owne Deformity.
30     And therefore, since I cannot proue a Louer,
31     To entertaine these faire well spoken dayes,
32     I am determined to proue a Villaine,
33     And hate the idle pleasures of these dayes.
34     Plots haue I laide, Inductions dangerous,
35     By drunken Prophesies, Libels, and Dreames,
36     To set my Brother {Clarence} and the King
37     In deadly hate, the one against the other:
38     And if King {Edward} be as true and iust,
39     As I am Subtle, False, and Treacherous,
40     This day should {Clarence} closely be mew'd vp:
41     About a Prophesie, which sayes that G,
42     Of {Edwards} heyres the murtherer shall be.
43     Diue thoughts downe to my soule, here {Clarence} comes.
44     <D {Enter Clarence, and Brakenbury, guarded}.>
45     Brother, good day: What meanes this armed guard
46     That waites vpon your Grace?
47     <S {Cla}.> His Maiesty tendring my persons safety,
48    *Hath appointed this Conduct, to conuey me to th' Tower
49     <S {Rich}.> Vpon what cause?
50     <S {Cla}.> Because my name is {George}.
51     <S {Rich}.> Alacke my Lord, that fault is none of yours:
52     He should for that commit your Godfathers.
53     O belike, his Maiesty hath some intent,
54     That you should be new Christned in the Tower,
55     But what's the matter {Clarence}, may I know?
56     <S {Cla}.> Yea {Richard}, when I know: but I protest
57     As yet I do not: But as I can learne,
58     He hearkens after Prophesies and Dreames,
59     And from the Crosse- row pluckes the letter G:
60     And sayes, a Wizard told him, that by G,
61     His issue disinherited should be.
62     And for my name of {George} begins with G,
63     It followes in his thought, that I am he.
64     These (as I learne) and such like toyes as these,
65     Hath moou'd his Highnesse to commit me now.
66    *<S {Rich}.> Why this it is, when men are rul'd by Women:
67     'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower,
68     My Lady {Grey} his Wife, {Clarence} 'tis shee,
69     That tempts him to this harsh Extremity.
70     Was it not shee, and that good man of Worship,
71     {Anthony Woodeuile} her Brother there,
72     That made him send Lord {Hastings} to the Tower?
73     From whence this present day he is deliuered?
74     We are not safe {Clarence}, we are not safe.
75     <S {Cla}.> By heauen, I thinke there is no man secure
76     But the Queenes Kindred, and night- walking Heralds,
77     That trudge betwixt the King, and Mistris {Shore}.
78     Heard you not what an humble Suppliant
79     Lord {Hastings} was, for her deliuery?
80     <S {Rich}.> Humbly complaining to her Deitie,
81     Got my Lord Chamberlaine his libertie.
82     Ile tell you what, I thinke it is our way,
83     If we will keepe in fauour with the King,
84     To be her men, and weare her Liuery.
85     The iealous ore- worne Widdow, and her selfe,
86     Since that our Brother dub'd them Gentlewomen,
87     Are mighty Gossips in our Monarchy.
88     <S {Bra}.> I beseech your Graces both to pardon me,
89     His Maiesty hath straightly giuen in charge,
90     That no man shall haue priuate Conference
91     (Of what degree soeuer) with your Brother.
      <P q5v>
92     <S {Rich}.> Euen so, and please your Worship {Brakenbury},
93     You may partake of any thing we say:
94     We speake no Treason man; We say the King
95     Is wise and vertuous, and his Noble Queene
96     Well strooke in yeares, faire, and not iealious.
97     We say, that {Shores} Wife hath a pretty Foot,
98     A cherry Lip, a bonny Eye, a passing pleasing tongue:
99     And that the Queenes Kindred are made gentle Folkes.
100    How say you sir? can you deny all this?
101    <S {Bra}.> With this (my Lord) my selfe haue nought to
102    doo.
103    <S {Rich}.> Naught to do with Mistris {Shore}?
104    I tell thee Fellow, he that doth naught with her
105    (Excepting one) were best to do it secretly alone.
106    <S {Bra}.> What one, my Lord?
107    <S {Rich}.> Her Husband Knaue, would'st thou betray me?
108    <S {Bra}.> I do beseech your Grace
109    To pardon me, and withall forbeare
110    Your Conference with the Noble Duke.
111   *<S {Cla}.> We know thy charge {Brakenbury}, and wil obey.
112    <S {Rich}.> We are the Queenes abiects, and must obey.
113    Brother farewell, I will vnto the King,
114    And whatsoe're you will imploy me in,
115    Were it to call King {Edwards} Widdow, Sister,
116    I will performe it to infranchise you.
117    Meane time, this deepe disgrace in Brotherhood,
118    Touches me deeper then you can imagine.
119    <S {Cla}.> I know it pleaseth neither of vs well.
120    <S {Rich}.> Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,
121    I will deliuer you, or else lye for you:
122    Meane time, haue patience.
123    <S {Cla}.> I must perforce: Farewell.  <D {Exit Clar[ence]}.>
124   *<S {Rich}.> Go  treade the path that thou shalt ne're return:
125    Simple plaine {Clarence}, I do loue thee so,
126    That I will shortly send thy Soule to Heauen,
127    If Heauen will take the present at our hands.
128    But who comes heere? the new deliuered {Hastings}?
129    <D {Enter Lord Hastings}.>
130    <S {Hast}.> Good time of day vnto my gracious Lord.
131    <S {Rich}.> As much vnto my good Lord Chamberlaine:
132    Well are you welcome to this open Ayre,
133    How hath your Lordship brook'd imprisonment?
134   *<S {Hast}.> With patience (Noble Lord) as prisoners must:
135    But I shall liue (my Lord) to giue them thankes
136    That were the cause of my imprisonment.
137    <S {Rich}.> No doubt, no doubt, and so shall {Clarence} too,
138    For they that were your Enemies, are his,
139    And haue preuail'd as much on him, as you,
140   *<S {Hast}.> More pitty, that the Eagles should be mew'd,
141    Whiles Kites and Buzards play at liberty.
142    <S {Rich}.> What newes abroad?
143    <S {Hast}.> No newes so bad abroad, as this at home:
144    The King is sickly, weake, and melancholly,
145    And his Physitians feare him mightily.
146    <S {Rich}.> Now by S[aint]. Iohn, that Newes is bad indeed.
147    O he hath kept an euill Diet long,
148    And ouer- much consum'd his Royall Person:
149    'Tis very greeuous to be thought vpon.
150    Where is he, in his bed?
151    <S {Hast}.> He is.
152    <S {Rich}.> Go you before, and I will follow you.
153    <D {Exit Hastings}.>
154    He cannot liue I hope, and must not dye,
155    Till {George} be pack'd with post- horse vp to Heauen.
156    Ile in to vrge his hatred more to {Clarence},
157    With Lyes well steel'd with weighty Arguments,
158    And if I faile not in my deepe intent,
159    {Clarence} hath not another day to liue:
160    Which done, God take King {Edward} to his mercy,
161    And leaue the world for me to bussle in.
162    For then, Ile marry Warwickes yongest daughter.
163    What though I kill'd her Husband, and her Father,
164    The readiest way to make the Wench amends,
165    Is to become her Husband, and her Father:
166    The which will I, not all so much for loue,
167    As for another secret close intent,
168    By marrying her, which I must reach vnto.
169    But yet I run before my horse to Market:
170    {Clarence} still breathes, {Edward} still liues and raignes,
171   *When they are gone, then must I count my gaines.  <D {Exit}>
172    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
173   *<D {Enter the Coarse of Henrie the sixt with Halberds to guard it},
174    {Lady Anne being the Mourner}.>
175   *<S {Anne}.> Set downe, set downe your honourable load,
176    If Honor may be shrowded in a Herse;
177    Whil'st I a- while obsequiously lament
178    Th' vntimely fall of  Vertuous Lancaster.
179    Poore key- cold Figure of a holy King,
180    Pale Ashes of the House of Lancaster;
181    Thou bloodlesse Remnant of that Royall Blood,
182    Be it lawfull that I inuocate thy Ghost,
183    To heare the Lamentations of poore {Anne},
184    Wife to thy {Edward}, to thy slaughtred Sonne,
185    Stab'd by the selfesame hand that made these wounds.
186    Loe, in these windowes that let forth thy life,
187    I powre the helplesse Balme of my poore eyes.
188    O cursed be the hand that made these holes:
189    Cursed the Heart, that had the heart to do it:
190    Cursed the Blood, that let this blood from hence:
191    More direfull hap betide that hated Wretch
192    That makes vs wretched by the death of thee,
193    Then I can wish to Wolues, to Spiders, Toades,
194    Or any creeping venom'd thing that liues.
195    If euer he haue Childe, Abortiue be it,
196    Prodigeous, and vntimely brought to light,
197    Whose vgly and vnnaturall Aspect
198    May fright the hopefull Mother at the view,
199    And that be Heyre to his vnhappinesse.
200    If euer he haue Wife, let her be made
201    More miserable by the death of him,
202    Then I am made by my young Lord, and thee.
203    Come now towards Chertsey with your holy Lode,
204    Taken from Paules, to be interred there.
205    And still as you are weary of this waight,
206    Rest you, whiles I lament King {Henries} Coarse.
207    <D {Enter Richard Duke of Gloster}.>
208   *<S {Rich}.> Stay you that beare the Coarse, & set it down.
209    <S {An}.> What blacke Magitian coniures vp this Fiend,
210    To stop deuoted charitable deeds?
211    <S {Rich}.> Villaines set downe the Coarse, or by S[aint]. Paul,
212    Ile make a Coarse of him that disobeyes.
      <P q6>
213    <S {Gen}.> My Lord stand backe, and let the Coffin passe.
214    <S {Rich}.> Vnmanner'd Dogge,
215    Stand'st thou when I commaund:
216    Aduance thy Halbert higher then my brest,
217    Or by S[aint]. Paul Ile strike thee to my Foote,
218    And spurne vpon thee Begger for thy boldnesse.
219    <S {Anne}.> What do you tremble? are you all affraid?
220    Alas, I blame you not, for you are Mortall,
221    And Mortall eyes cannot endure the Diuell.
222    Auant thou dreadfull minister of #Hell;
223    Thou had'st but power ouer his Mortall body,
224    His Soule thou canst not haue: Therefore be gone.
225    <S {Rich}.> Sweet Saint, for Charity, be not so curst.
226    <S {An}.> Foule Diuell,
227    For Gods sake hence, and trouble vs not,
228    For thou hast made the happy earth thy #Hell:
229    Fill'd it with cursing cries, and deepe exclaimes:
230    If thou delight to view thy heynous deeds,
231    Behold this patterne of thy Butcheries.
232    Oh Gentlemen, see, see dead {Henries} wounds,
233    Open their congeal'd mouthes, and bleed afresh.
234    Blush, blush, thou lumpe of fowle Deformitie:
235    For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
236    From cold and empty Veines where no blood dwels.
237    Thy Deeds inhumane and vnnaturall,
238    Prouokes this Deluge most vnnaturall.
239    O God! which this Blood mad'st, reuenge his death:
240    O Earth! which this Blood drink'st, reuenge his death.
241   *Either Heau'n with Lightning strike the murth'rer dead:
242    Or Earth gape open wide, and eate him quicke,
243    As thou dost swallow vp this good Kings blood,
244    Which his Hell- gouern'd arme hath butchered.
245    <S {Rich}.> Lady, you know no Rules of Charity,
246    Which renders good for bad, Blessings for Curses.
247   *<S {An}.> Villaine, thou know'st nor law of God nor Man,
248    No Beast so fierce, but knowes some touch of pitty.
249    <S {Rich}.> But I know none, and therefore am no Beast.
250    <S {An}.> O wonderfull, when diuels tell the truth!
251    <S {Rich}.> More wonderfull, when Angels are so angry:
252    Vouchsafe (diuine perfection of a Woman)
253    Of these supposed Crimes, to giue me leaue
254    By circumstance, but to acquit my selfe.
255    <S {An}.> Vouchsafe (defus'd infection of man)
256    Of these knowne euils, but to giue me leaue
257    By circumstance, to curse thy cursed Selfe.
258    <S {Rich}.> Fairer then tongue can name thee, let me haue
259    Some patient leysure to excuse my selfe.
260    <S {An}.> Fouler then heart can thinke thee,
261    Thou can'st make no excuse currant,
262    But to hang thy selfe.
263    <S {Rich}.> By such dispaire, I should accuse my selfe.
264    <S {An}.> And by dispairing shalt thou stand excused,
265    For doing worthy Vengeance on thy selfe,
266    That did'st vnworthy slaughter vpon others.
267    <S {Rich}.> Say that I slew them not.
268    <S {An}.> Then say they were not slaine:
269    But dead they are, and diuellish slaue by thee.
270    <S {Rich}.> I did not kill your Husband.
271    <S {An}.> Why then he is aliue.
272   *<S {Rich}.> Nay, he is dead, and slaine by Edwards hands.
273    <S {An}.> In thy foule throat thou Ly'st,
274    Queene {Margaret} saw
275    Thy murd'rous Faulchion smoaking in his blood:
276    The which, thou once didd'st bend against her brest,
277    But that thy Brothers beate aside the point.
278    <S {Rich}.> I was prouoked by her sland'rous tongue,
279    That laid their guilt, vpon my guiltlesse Shoulders.
280    <S {An}.> Thou was't prouoked by thy bloody minde,
281    That neuer dream'st on ought but Butcheries:
282    Did'st thou not kill this King?
283    <S {Rich}.> I graunt ye.
284    <S {An}.> Do'st grant me Hedge- hogge,
285    Then God graunt me too
286    Thou may'st be damned for that wicked deede,
287    O he was gentle, milde, and vertuous.
288   *<S {Rich}.> The better for the King of heauen that hath him.
289    <S {An}.> He is in heauen, where thou shalt neuer come.
290   *<S {Rich}.> Let him thanke me, that holpe to send him thi-ther:
291   _
292    For he was fitter for that place then earth.
293    <S {An}.> And thou vnfit for any place, but #hell.
294   *<S {Rich}.> Yes one place else, if you will heare me name it.
295    <S {An}.> Some dungeon.
296    <S {Rich}.> Your Bed- chamber.
297    <S {An}.> #Ill rest betide the chamber where thou lyest.
298    <S {Rich}.> So will it Madam, till I lye with you.
299    <S {An}.> I hope so.
300    <S {Rich}.> I know so. But gentle Lady {Anne},
301    To leaue this keene encounter of our wittes,
302    And fall something into a slower method.
303    Is not the causer of the timelesse deaths
304    Of these {Plantagenets}, {Henrie} and {Edward},
305    As blamefull as the Executioner.
306    <S {An}.> Thou was't the cause, and most accurst effect.
307    <S {Rich}.> Your beauty was the cause of that effect:
308    Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleepe,
309    To vndertake the death of all the world,
310    So I might liue one houre in your sweet bosome.
311    <S {An}.> If I thought that, I tell thee Homicide,
312    These Nailes should rent that beauty from my Cheekes.
313   *<S {Rich}.> These eyes could not endure y beauties wrack,
314    You should not blemish it, if I stood by;
315    As all the world is cheared by the Sunne,
316    So I by that: It is my day, my life.
317   *<S {An}.> Blacke night ore- shade thy day, & death thy life.
318    <S {Rich}.> Curse not thy selfe faire Creature,
319    Thou art both.
320    <S {An}.> I would I were, to be reueng'd on thee.
321    <S {Rich}.> It is a quarrell most vnnaturall,
322    To be reueng'd on him that loueth thee.
323    <S {An}.> It is a quarrell iust and reasonable,
324    To be reueng'd on him that kill'd my Husband.
325    <S {Rich}.> He that bereft #the Lady of thy Husband,
326    Did it to helpe thee to a better Husband.
327    <S {An}.> His better doth not breath vpon the earth.
328    <S {Rich}.> He liues, that loues thee better then he could.
329    <S {An}.> Name him.
330    <S {Rich}.> {Plantagenet}.
331    <S {An}.> Why that was he.
332    <S {Rich}.> The selfesame name, but one of better Nature.
333    <S {An}.> Where is he?
334    <S {Rich}.> Heere:  <D {Spits at him}.>
335    Why dost thou spit at me.
336    <S {An}.> Would it were mortall poyson, for thy sake.
337    <S {Rich}.> Neuer came poyson from so sweet a place.
338    <S {An}.> Neuer hung poyson on a fowler Toade.
339    Out of my sight, thou dost infect mine eyes.
340    <S {Rich}.> Thine eyes (sweet Lady) haue infected mine.
341   *<S {An}.> Would they were Basiliskes, to strike thee dead.
342    <S {Rich}.> I would they were, that I might dye at once:
343    For now they kill me with a liuing death.
344   *Those eyes of thine, from mine haue drawne salt Teares;
      <P q6v>
345    Sham'd their Aspects with store of childish drops:
346    These eyes, which neuer shed remorsefull teare,
347    No, when my Father Yorke, and {Edward} wept,
348    To heare the pittious moane that Rutland made
349    When black- fac'd {Clifford} shooke his sword at him.
350    Nor when thy warlike Father like a Childe,
351    Told the sad storie of my Fathers death,
352    And twenty times, made pause to sob and weepe:
353    That all the standers by had wet their cheekes
354    Like Trees bedash'd with raine. In that sad time,
355    My manly eyes did scorne an humble teare:
356    And what these sorrowes could not thence exhale,
357    Thy Beauty hath, and made them blinde with weeping.
358    I neuer sued to Friend, nor Enemy:
359    My Tongue could neuer learne sweet smoothing word.
360    But now thy Beauty is propos'd my Fee,
361   *My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speake.
362    <D {She lookes scornfully at him}.>
363    Teach not thy lip such Scorne; for it was made
364    For kissing Lady, not for such contempt.
365    If thy reuengefull heart cannot forgiue,
366    Loe heere I lend thee this sharpe- pointed Sword,
367    Which if thou please to hide in this true brest,
368    And let the Soule forth that adoreth thee,
369    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
370    And humbly begge the death vpon my knee,
371    <D {He layes his brest open, she offers at with his sword}.>
372    Nay do not pause: For I did kill King {Henrie},
373    But 'twas thy Beauty that prouoked me.
374    Nay now dispatch: 'Twas I that stabb'd yong {Edward},
375    But 'twas thy Heauenly face that set me on.
376    <D {She fals the Sword}.>
377    Take vp the Sword againe, or take vp me.
378    <S {An}.> Arise Dissembler, though I wish thy death,
379    I will not be thy Executioner.
380    <S {Rich}.> Then bid me kill my selfe, and I will do it.
381    <S {An}.> I haue already.
382    <S {Rich}.> That was in thy rage:
383    Speake it againe, and euen with the word,
384    This hand, which for thy loue, did kill thy Loue,
385    Shall for thy loue, kill a farre truer Loue,
386    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
387    <S {An}.> I would I knew thy heart.
388    <S {Rich}.> 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
389    <S {An}.> I feare me, both are false.
390    <S {Rich}.> Then neuer Man was true.
391    <S {An}.> Well, well, put vp your Sword.
392    <S {Rich}.> Say then my Peace is made.
393    <S {An}.> That shalt thou know heereafter.
394    <S {Rich}.> But shall I liue in hope.
395    <S {An}.> All men I hope liue so.
396    Vouchsafe to weare this Ring.
397    <S {Rich}.> Looke how my Ring incompasseth thy Finger,
398    Euen so thy Brest incloseth my poore heart:
399    Weare both of them, for both of them are thine.
400    And if thy poore deuoted Seruant may
401    But beg one fauour at thy gracious hand,
402    Thou dost confirme his happinesse for euer.
403    <S {An}.> What is it?
404   *<S {Rich}.> That it may please you leaue these sad designes,
405    To him that hath most cause to be a Mourner,
406    And presently repayre to Crosbie House:
407    Where (after I haue solemnly interr'd
408    At Chertsey Monast'ry this Noble King,
409    And wet his Graue with my Repentant Teares)
410    I will with all expedient duty see you,
411    For diuers vnknowne Reasons, I beseech you,
412    Grant me this Boon.
413    <S {An}.> With all my heart, and much it ioyes me too,
414    To see you are become so penitent.
415    {Tressel} and {Barkley}, go along with me.
416    <S {Rich}.> Bid me farwell.
417    <S {An}.> 'Tis more then you deserue:
418    But since you teach me how to flatter you,
419    Imagine I haue saide farewell already.
420    <D {Exit two with Anne}.>
421    <S {Gent}.> Towards Chertsey, Noble Lord?
422   *<S {Rich}.> No: to White Friars, there attend my comming
423    <D {Exit Coarse}>
424    Was euer woman in this humour woo'd?
425    Was euer woman in this humour wonne?
426    Ile haue her, but I will not keepe her long.
427    What? I that kill'd her Husband, and his Father,
428    To take her in her hearts extreamest hate,
429    With curses in her mouth, Teares in her eyes,
430    The bleeding witnesse of my hatred by,
431    Hauing God, her Conscience, and these bars against me,
432    And I, no Friends to backe my suite withall,
433    But the plaine Diuell, and dissembling lookes?
434    And yet to winne her? All the world to nothing.
435    Hah!
436    Hath she forgot alreadie that braue Prince,
437    {Edward}, her Lord, whom I (some three monthes since)
438    Stab'd in my angry mood, at Tewkesbury?
439    A sweeter, and a louelier Gentleman,
440    Fram'd in the prodigallity of Nature:
441    Yong, Valiant, Wise, and (no doubt) right Royal,
442    The spacious World cannot againe affoord:
443    And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
444    That cropt the Golden prime of this sweet Prince,
445    And made her Widdow to a wofull Bed?
446    On me, whose All not equals {Edwards} Moytie?
447    On me, that halts, and am mishapen thus?
448    My Dukedome, to a Beggerly denier!
449    I do mistake my person all this while:
450    Vpon my life she findes (although I cannot)
451    My selfe to be a maru'llous proper man.
452    Ile be at Charges for a Looking- glasse,
453    And entertaine a score or two of Taylors,
454    To study fashions to adorne my body:
455    Since I am crept in fauour with my selfe,
456    I will maintaine it with some little cost.
457    But first Ile turne yon Fellow in his Graue,
458    And then returne lamenting to my Loue.
459    Shine out faire Sunne, till I haue bought a glasse,
460    That I may see my Shadow as I passe.  <D {Exit}.>
461    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
462    <D {Enter the Queene Mother, Lord Riuers},
463    {and Lord Gray}.>
464   *<S {Riu}.> Haue patience Madam, ther's no doubt his Maiesty
465    Will soone recouer his accustom'd health.
466    <S {Gray}.> In that you brooke it #ill, it makes him worse,
467    Therefore for Gods sake entertaine good comfort,
468    And cheere his Grace with quicke and merry eyes
469    <S {Qu}.> If he were dead, what would betide on me?
      <P r1>
470    If he were dead, what would betide on me?
471    <S {Gray}.> No other harme, but losse of such a Lord.
472    <S {Qu}.> The losse of such a Lord, includes all harmes.
473   *<S {Gray}.> The Heauens haue blest you with a goodly Son,
474    To be your Comforter, when he is gone.
475    <S {Qu}.> Ah! he is yong; and his minority
476    Is put vnto the trust of {Richard Glouster},
477    A man that loues not me, nor none of you.
478    <S {Riu}.> Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
479    <S {Qu}.> It is determin'd, not concluded yet:
480    But so it must be, if the King miscarry.
481    <D {Enter Buckingham and Derby}.>
482   *<S {Gray}.> Here comes the Lord of Buckingham & Derby.
483    <S {Buc}.> Good time of day vnto your Royall Grace.
484   *<S {Der}.> God make your Maiesty ioyful, as you haue bin
485    <S {Qu}.> The Countesse {Richmond}, good my L[ord]. of {Derby}.
486    To your good prayer, will scarsely say, Amen.
487    Yet {Derby}, not withstanding shee's your wife,
488    And loues not me, be you good Lord assur'd,
489    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
490    <S {Der}.> I do beseech you, either not beleeue
491    The enuious slanders of her false Accusers:
492    Or if she be accus'd on true report,
493    Beare with her weaknesse, which I thinke proceeds
494    From wayward sicknesse, and no grounded malice.
495    <S {Qu}.> Saw you the King to day my Lord of {Derby}.
496    <S {Der}.> But now the Duke of Buckingham and I,
497    Are come from visiting his Maiesty.
498    <S {Que}.> What likelyhood of his amendment Lords.
499   *<S {Buc}.> Madam good hope, his Grace speaks chearfully.
500   *<S {Qu}.> God grant him health, did you confer with him?
501    <S {Buc}.> #I Madam, he desires to make attonement
502    Betweene the Duke of Glouster, and your Brothers,
503    And betweene them, and my Lord Chamberlaine,
504    And sent to warne them to his Royall presence.
505    <S {Qu}.> Would all were well, but that will neuer be,
506    I feare our happinesse is at the height.
507    <D {Enter Richard}.>
508    <S {Rich}.> They do me wrong, and I will not indure it,
509    Who is it that complaines vnto the King,
510    That I (forsooth) am sterne, and loue them not?
511    By holy {Paul}, they loue his Grace but lightly,
512    That fill his eares with such dissentious Rumors.
513    Because I cannot flatter, and looke faire,
514    Smile in mens faces, smooth, deceiue, and cogge,
515    Ducke with French nods, and Apish curtesie,
516    I must be held a rancorous Enemy.
517    Cannot a plaine man liue, and thinke no harme,
518    But thus his simple truth must be abus'd,
519    With silken, slye, insinuating Iackes?
520   *<S {Grey}.> To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
521    <S {Rich}.> To thee, that hast nor Honesty, nor Grace:
522    When haue I iniur'd thee? When done thee wrong?
523    Or thee? or thee? or any of your Faction?
524    A plague vpon you all. His Royall Grace
525    (Whom God preserue better then you would wish)
526    Cannot be quiet scarse a breathing while,
527    But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
528    <S {Qu}.> Brother of Glouster, you mistake the matter:
529    The King on his owne Royall disposition,
530    (And not prouok'd by any Sutor else)
531    Ayming (belike) at your interiour hatred,
532    That in your outward action shewes it selfe
533    Against my Children, Brothers, and my Selfe,
534    Makes him to send, that he may learne the ground.
535    <S {Rich}.> I cannot tell, the world is growne so bad,
536    That Wrens make prey, where Eagles dare not pearch.
537    Since euerie Iacke became a Gentleman,
538    There's many a gentle person made a Iacke.
539    <S {Qu}.> Come, come, we know your meaning Brother |(Gloster
540    You enuy my aduancement, and my friends:
541    God grant we neuer may haue neede of you.
542   *<S {Rich}.> Meane time, God grants that I haue need of you.
543    Our Brother is imprison'd by your meanes,
544    My selfe disgrac'd, and the Nobilitie
545    Held in contempt, while great Promotions
546    Are daily giuen to ennoble those
547    That scarse some two dayes since were worth a Noble.
548    <S {Qu}.> By him that rais'd me to this carefull height,
549    From that contented hap which I inioy'd,
550    I neuer did incense his Maiestie
551    Against the Duke of {Clarence}, but haue bin
552    An earnest aduocate to plead for him.
553    My Lord you do me shamefull iniurie,
554    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
555    <S {Rich}.> You may deny that you were not the meane
556    Of my Lord {Hastings} late imprisonment.
557    <S {Riu}.> She may my Lord, for===
558   *<S {Rich}.> She may Lord {Riuers}, why who knowes not so?
559    She may do more sir then denying that:
560    She may helpe you to many faire preferments,
561    And then deny her ayding hand therein,
562    And lay those Honors on your high desert.
563    What may she not, she may, #I marry may she.
564    <S {Riu}.> What marry may she?
565    <S {Ric}.> What marrie may she? Marrie with a King,
566    A Batcheller, and a handsome stripling too,
567    Iwis your Grandam had a worser match.
568    <S {Qu}.> My Lord of Glouster, I haue too long borne
569    Your blunt vpbraidings, and your bitter scoffes:
570    By heauen, I will acquaint his Maiestie
571    Of those grosse taunts that oft I haue endur'd.
572    I had rather be a Countrie seruant maide
573    Then a great Queene, with this condition,
574    To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at,
575    Small ioy haue I in being Englands Queene.
576    <D {Enter old Queene Margaret}.>
577    <S {Mar}.> And lesned be that small, God I beseech him,
578    Thy honor, state, and seate, is due to me.
579   *<S {Rich}.> What? threat you me with telling of the King?
580    I will auouch't in presence of the King:
581    I dare aduenture to be sent to th' Towre.
582    'Tis time to speake,
583    My paines are quite forgot.
584    <S {Margaret}.> Out Diuell,
585    I do remember them too well:
586    Thou killd'st my Husband {Henrie} in the Tower,
587    And {Edward} my poore Son, at Tewkesburie.
588    <S {Rich}.> Ere you were Queene,
589    #I, or your Husband King:
590    I was a packe- horse in his great affaires:
591    A weeder out of his proud Aduersaries,
592    A liberall rewarder of his Friends,
593    To royalize his blood, I spent mine owne.
594    <S {Margaret}.> #I and much better blood
595    Then his, or thine.
      <P r1v><C A>
596    <S {Rich}.> In all which time, you and your Husband {Grey}
597    Were factious, for the House of {Lancaster};
598    And {Riuers}, so were you: Was not your Husband,
599    In {Margarets} Battaile, at Saint {Albons}, slaine?
600    Let me put in your mindes, if you forget
601    What you haue beene ere this, and what you are:
602    Withall, what I haue beene, and what I am.
603    <S {Q.M}.> A murth'rous Villaine, and so still thou art.
604   *<S {Rich}.> Poore {Clarence} did forsake his Father {Warwicke},
605    #I, and forswore himselfe (which Iesu pardon.)
606    <S {Q.M}.> Which God reuenge.
607    <S {Rich}.> To fight on {Edwards} partie, for the Crowne,
608    And for his meede, poore Lord, he is mewed vp:
609    I would to God my heart were Flint, like {Edwards},
610    Or {Edwards} soft and pittifull, like mine;
611    I am too childish foolish for this World.
612   *<S {Q.M}.> High thee to #Hell for shame, & leaue this World
613    Thou Cacodemon, there thy Kingdome is.
614    <S {Riu}.> My Lord of Gloster: in those busie dayes,
615    Which here you vrge, to proue vs Enemies,
616    We follow'd then our Lord, our Soueraigne King,
617    So should we you, if you should be our King.
618    <S {Rich}.> If I should be? I had rather be a Pedler:
619    Farre be it from my heart, the thought thereof.
620    <S {Qu}.> As little ioy (my Lord) as you suppose
621    You should enioy, were you this Countries King,
622    As little ioy you may suppose in me,
623    That I enioy, being the Queene thereof.
624    <S {Q.M}.> A little ioy enioyes the Queene thereof,
625    For I am shee, and altogether ioylesse:
626    I can no longer hold me patient.
627    Heare me, you wrangling Pyrates, that fall out,
628    In sharing that which you haue pill'd from me:
629    Which #off you trembles not, that lookes on me?
630    If not, that I am Queene, you bow like Subiects;
631    Yet that by you depos'd, you quake like Rebells.
632    Ah gentle Villaine, doe not turne away.
633   *<S {Rich}.> Foule wrinckled Witch, what mak'st thou in my |(sight?
634    <S {Q.M}.> But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
635    That will I make, before I let thee goe.
636    <S {Rich}.> Wert thou not banished, on paine of death?
637    <S {Q.M}.> I was: but I doe find more paine in banishment,
638    Then death can yeeld me here, by my abode.
639    A Husband and a Sonne thou ow'st to me,
640    And thou a Kingdome; all of you, allegeance:
641    This Sorrow that I haue, by right is yours,
642    And all the Pleasures you vsurpe, are mine.
643    <S {Rich}.> The Curse my Noble Father layd on thee,
644   *When thou didst Crown his Warlike Brows with Paper,
645    And with thy scornes drew'st Riuers from his eyes,
646    And then to dry them, gau'st the Duke a Clowt,
647    Steep'd in the faultlesse blood of prettie {Rutland}:
648    His Curses then, from bitternesse of Soule,
649    Denounc'd against thee, are all falne vpon thee:
650    And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
651    <S {Qu}.> So iust is God, to right the innocent.
652    <S {Hast}.> O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that Babe,
653    And the most mercilesse, that ere was heard of.
654    <S {Riu}.> Tyrants themselues wept when it was reported.
655    <S {Dors}.> No man but prophecied reuenge for it.
656    <S {Buck}.> {Northumberland}, then present, wept to see it.
657    <S {Q.M}.> What? were you snarling all before I came,
658    Ready to catch each other by the throat,
659    And turne you all your hatred now on me?
660    Did {Yorkes} dread Curse preuaile so much with Heauen,
661    That {Henries} death, my louely {Edwards} death,
662    Their Kingdomes losse, my wofull Banishment,
663    Should all but answer for that peeuish Brat?
664    Can Curses pierce the Clouds, and enter Heauen?
665    Why then giue way dull Clouds to my quick Curses.
666    Though not by Warre, by Surfet dye your King,
667    As ours by Murther, to make him a King.
668    {Edward} thy Sonne, that now is Prince of Wales,
669    For {Edward} our Sonne, that was Prince of Wales,
670    Dye in his youth, by like vntimely violence.
671    Thy selfe a Queene, for me that was a Queene,
672    Out- liue thy glory, like my wretched selfe:
673    Long may'st thou liue, to wayle thy Childrens death,
674    And see another, as I see thee now,
675    Deck'd in thy Rights, as thou art stall'd in mine.
676    Long dye thy happie dayes, before thy death,
677    And after many length'ned howres of griefe,
678    Dye neyther Mother, Wife, nor Englands Queene.
679    {#Riuers} and {Dorset}, you were standers by,
680    And so wast thou, Lord {Hastings}, when my Sonne
681    Was stab'd with bloody Daggers: God, I pray him,
682    That none of you may liue his naturall age,
683    But by some vnlook'd accident cut off.
684   *<S {Rich}.> Haue done thy Charme, y hateful wither'd Hagge.
685   *<S {Q.M}.> And leaue out thee? stay Dog, for y shalt heare me.
686    If Heauen haue any grieuous plague in store,
687    Exceeding those that I can wish vpon thee,
688    O let them keepe it, till thy sinnes be ripe,
689    And then hurle downe their indignation
690    On thee, the troubler of the poore Worlds peace.
691    The Worme of Conscience still begnaw thy Soule,
692    Thy Friends suspect for Traytors while thou liu'st,
693    And take deepe Traytors for thy dearest Friends:
694    No sleepe close vp that deadly Eye of thine,
695    Vnlesse it be while some tormenting Dreame
696    Affrights thee with a #Hell of ougly Deuills.
697    Thou eluish mark'd, abortiue rooting Hogge,
698    Thou that wast seal'd in thy Natiuitie
699    The slaue of Nature, and the Sonne of #Hell:
700    Thou slander of thy heauie Mothers Wombe,
701    Thou loathed Issue of thy Fathers Loynes,
702    Thou Ragge of Honor, thou detested===
703    <S {Rich}.> {Margaret}.
704    <S {Q.M}.> {Richard}. <S {Rich}.> Ha.
705    <S {Q.M}.> I call thee not.
706    <S {Rich}.> I cry thee mercie then: for I did thinke,
707    That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
708    <S {Q.M}.> Why so I did, but look'd for no reply.
709    Oh let me make the Period to my Curse.
710    <S {Rich}.> 'Tis done by me and ends in {Margaret}.
711   *<S {Qu}.> Thus haue you breath'd your Curse against your self.
712   *<S {Q.M}.> Poore painted Queen, vain flourish of my fortune,
713    Why strew'st thou Sugar on that Bottel'd Spider,
714    Whose deadly Web ensnareth thee about?
715    Foole, foole, thou whet'st a Knife to kill thy selfe:
716    The day will come, that thou shalt wish for me,
717   *To helpe thee curse this poysonous Bunch- backt Toade.
718    <S {Hast}.> False boding Woman, end thy frantick Curse,
719    Least to thy harme, thou moue our patience.
720    <S {Q.M}.> Foule shame vpon you, you haue all mou'd mine.
721   *<S {Ri}.> Were you wel seru'd, you would be taught your duty.
722    <S {Q.M}.> To serue me well, you all should do me duty,
723    Teach me to be your Queene, and you my Subiects:
724    O serue me well, and teach your selues that duty.
725    <S {Dors}.> Dispute not with her, shee is lunaticke.
726    <S {Q.M}.> Peace Master Marquesse, you are malapert,
727    Your fire- new stampe of Honor is scarce currant.

728    O that your yong Nobility could iudge
729    What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable.
730    They that stand high, haue many blasts to shake them,
731    And if they fall, they dash themselues to peeces.

734    <S {Dor}.> It touches you my Lord, as much as me.
735    <S {Rich}.> #I, and much more: but I was borne so high:
736    Our ayerie buildeth in the Cedars top,
737    And dallies with the winde, and scornes the Sunne.
738    <S {Mar}.> And turnes the Sun to shade: alas, alas,
739    Witnesse my Sonne, now in the shade of death,
740    Whose bright out- shining beames, thy cloudy wrath
741    Hath in eternall darknesse folded vp.
742    Your ayery buildeth in our ayeries Nest:
743    O God that seest it, do not suffer it,
744    As it is wonne with blood, lost be it so.
745    <S {Buc}.> Peace, peace for shame: If not, for Charity.
746    <S {Mar}.> Vrge neither charity, nor shame to me:
747    Vncharitably with me haue you dealt,
748    And shamefully my hopes (by you) are butcher'd.
749    My Charity is outrage, Life my shame,
750    And in that shame, still liue my sorrowes rage.
751    <S {Buc}.> Haue done, haue done.
752    <S {Mar}.> O Princely Buckingham, Ile kisse thy hand,
753    In signe of League and amity with thee:
754    Now faire befall thee, and thy Noble house:
755    Thy Garments are not spotted with our blood:
756    Nor thou within the compasse of my curse.
757    <S {Buc}.> Nor no one heere: for Curses neuer passe
758    The lips of those that breath them in the ayre.
759    <S {Mar}.> I will not thinke but they ascend the sky,
760    And there awake Gods gentle sleeping peace.
761    O Buckingham, take heede of yonder dogge:
762    Looke when he fawnes, he bites; and when he bites,
763    His venom tooth will rankle to the death.
764    Haue not to do with him, beware of him,
765    Sinne, death, and #hell haue set their markes on him,
766    And all their Ministers attend on him.
767    <S {Rich}.> What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham.
768    <S {Buc}.> Nothing that I respect my gracious Lord.
769    <S {Mar}.> What dost thou scorne me
770    For my gentle counsell?
771    And sooth the diuell that I warne thee from.
772    O but remember this another day:
773    When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow:
774    And say (poore {Margaret}) was a Prophetesse:
775    Liue each of you the subiects to his hate,
776    And he to yours, and all of you to Gods.  <D {Exit}.>
777    <S {Buc}.> My haire doth stand #an end to heare her curses.
778    <S {Riu}.> And so doth mine, I muse why she's at libertie.
779    <S {Rich}.> I cannot blame her, by Gods holy mother,
780    She hath had too much wrong, and I repent
781    My part thereof, that I haue done to her.
782    <S {Mar}.> I neuer did her any to my knowledge.
783    <S {Rich}.> Yet you haue all the vantage of her wrong:
784    I was too hot, to do somebody good,
785    That is too cold in thinking of it now:
786    Marry as for {Clarence}, he is well repayed:
787    He is frank'd vp to fatting for his paines,
788    God pardon them, that are the cause thereof.
789    <S {Riu}.> A vertuous, and a Christian- like conclusion
790    To pray for them that haue done scath to vs.
791    <S {Rich}.> So do I euer, being well aduis'd.
792    <D {Speakes to himselfe}.>
793    For had I curst now, I had curst my selfe.
794    <D {Enter Catesby}.>
795    <S {Cates}.> Madam, his Maiesty doth call for you,
796    And for your Grace, and yours my gracious Lord.
797    <S {Qu}.> {Catesby} I come, Lords will you go with mee.
798    <S {Riu}.> We wait vpon your Grace.
799    <D {Exeunt all but Gloster}.>
800    <S {Rich}.> I do the wrong, and first begin to brawle.
801    The secret Mischeefes that I set abroach,
802    I lay vnto the greeuous charge of others.
803    {Clarence}, who I indeede haue cast in darknesse,
804    I do beweepe to many simple Gulles,
805    Namely to {Derby}, {Hastings}, {Buckingham},
806    And tell them 'tis the Queene, and her Allies,
807    That stirre the King against the Duke my Brother.
808    Now they beleeue it, and withall whet me
809    To be reueng'd on {Riuers}, {Dorset}, {Grey}.
810    But then I sigh, and with a peece of Scripture,
811    Tell them that God bids vs do good for euill:
812    And thus I cloath my naked Villanie
813    With odde old ends, stolne forth of holy Writ,
814    And seeme a Saint, when most I play the deuill.
815    <D {Enter two murtherers}.>
816    But soft, heere come my Executioners,
817    How now my hardy stout resolued Mates,
818    Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
819   *<S {Vil}.> We are my Lord, and come to haue the Warrant,
820    That we may be admitted where he is.
821    <S {Ric}.> Well thought vpon, I haue it heare about me:
822    When you haue done, repayre to {Crosby} place;
823    But sirs be sodaine in the execution,
824    Withall obdurate, do not heare him pleade;
825    For {Clarence} is well spoken, and perhappes
826    May moue your hearts to pitty, if you marke him.
827    <S {Vil}.> Tut, tut, my Lord, we will not stand to prate,
828    Talkers are no good dooers, be assur'd:
829    We go to vse our hands, and not our tongues.
830   *<S {Rich}.> Your eyes drop Mill- stones, when Fooles eyes
831    fall Teares:
832    I like you Lads, about your businesse straight.
833    Go, go, dispatch.
834    <S {Vil}.> We will my Noble Lord.
835    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
836    <D {Enter Clarence and Keeper}.>
837    <S {Keep}.> Why lookes your Grace so heauily to day.
838    <S {Cla}.> O, I haue past a miserable night,
839    So full of fearefull Dreames, of vgly sights,
840    That as I am a Christian faithfull man,
841    I would not spend another such a night
842    Though 'twere to buy a world of happy daies:
843    So full of dismall terror was the time.
844   *<S {Keep}.> What was your dream my Lord, I pray you tel me
845    <S {Cla}.> Me thoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
846    And was embark'd to crosse to Burgundy,
847    And in my company my Brother Glouster,
848    Who from my Cabin tempted me to walke,
849    Vpon the Hatches: There we look'd toward England,
850    And cited vp a thousand heauy times,
      <P r2v>
851    During the warres of Yorke and Lancaster
852    That had befalne vs. As we pac'd along
853    Vpon the giddy footing of the Hatches,
854    Me thought that Glouster stumbled, and in falling
855    Strooke me (that thought to stay him) ouer- boord,
856    Into the tumbling billowes of the maine.
857    O Lord, me thought what paine it was to drowne,
858    What dreadfull noise of water in mine eares,
859    What sights of vgly death within mine eyes.
860    Me thoughts, I saw a thousand fearfull wrackes:
861    A thousand men that Fishes gnaw'd vpon:
862    Wedges of Gold, great Anchors, heapes of Pearle,
863    Inestimable Stones, vnvalewed Iewels,
864    All scattred in the bottome of the Sea,
865    Some lay in dead- mens Sculles, and in the holes
866    Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept
867    (As 'twere in scorne of eyes) reflecting Gemmes,
868    That woo'd the slimy bottome of the deepe,
869    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scattred by.
870    <S {Keep}.> Had you such leysure in the time of death
871    To gaze vpon these secrets of the deepe?
872    <S {Cla}.> Me thought I had, and often did I striue
873    To yeeld the Ghost: but still the enuious Flood
874    Stop'd in my soule, and would not let it forth
875    To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring ayre:
876    But smother'd it within my panting bulke,
877    Who almost burst, to belch it in the Sea.
878    <S {Keep}.> Awak'd you not in this sore Agony?
879    <S {Clar}.> No, no, my Dreame was lengthen'd after life.
880    O then, began the Tempest to my Soule.
881    I past (me thought) the Melancholly Flood,
882    With that sowre Ferry- man which Poets write of,
883    Vnto the Kingdome of perpetuall Night.
884    The first that there did greet my Stranger- soule,
885    Was my great Father- in- Law, renowned Warwicke,
886    Who spake alowd: What scourge for Periurie,
887    Can this darke Monarchy affoord false {Clarence}?
888    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by,
889    A Shadow like an Angell, with bright hayre
890    Dabbel'd in blood, and he shriek'd out alowd
891    {Clarence} is come, false, fleeting, periur'd {Clarence},
892    That stabb'd me in the field by Tewkesbury:
893    Seize on him Furies, take him vnto Torment.
894    With that (me thought) a Legion of foule Fiends
895    Inuiron'd me, and howled in mine eares
896    Such hiddeous cries, that with the very Noise,
897    I (trembling) wak'd, and for a season after,
898    Could not beleeue, but that I was in #Hell,
899    Such terrible Impression made my Dreame.
900    <S {Keep}.> No maruell Lord, though it affrighted you,
901    I am affraid (me thinkes) to heare you tell it.
902    <S {Cla}.> Ah Keeper, Keeper, I haue done these things
903    (That now giue euidence against my Soule)
904    For {Edwards} sake, and see how he requits mee.
905    O God! if my deepe prayres cannot appease thee,
906    But thou wilt be aueng'd on my misdeeds,
907    Yet execute thy wrath in me alone:
908    O spare my guiltlesse Wife, and my poore children.
909    Keeper, I prythee sit by me a- while,
910    My Soule is heauy, and I faine would sleepe.
911   *<S {Keep}.> I will my Lord, God giue your Grace good rest.
912    <D {Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant}.>
913    <S {Bra}.> Sorrow breakes Seasons, and reposing houres,
914    Makes the Night Morning, and the Noon- tide night:
915    Princes haue but their Titles for their Glories,
916    An outward Honor, for an inward Toyle,
917    And for vnfelt Imaginations
918    They often feele a world of restlesse Cares:
919    So that betweene their Titles, and low Name,
920    There's nothing differs, but the outward fame.
921    <D {Enter two Murtherers}.>
922    <S 1.{Mur}.> Ho, who's heere?
923   *<S {Bra}.> What would'st thou Fellow? And how camm'st
924    thou hither.
925   *<S 2.{Mur}.> I would speak with {Clarence}, and I came hi-ther
926    on my Legges.
927    <S {Bra}.> What so breefe?
928    <S 1.> 'Tis better (Sir) then to be tedious:
929    Let him see our Commission, and talke no more.  <D {Reads}>
930    <S {Bra}.> I am in this, commanded to deliuer
931    The Noble Duke of {Clarence} to your hands.
932    I will not reason what is meant heereby,
933    Because I will be guiltlesse from the meaning.
934    There lies the Duke asleepe, and there the Keyes.
935    Ile to the King, and signifie to him,
936    That thus I haue resign'd to you my charge.  <D {Exit}.>
937    <S 1> You may sir, 'tis a point of wisedome:
938    Far you well.
939    <S 2> What, shall we stab him as he sleepes.
940   *<S 1> No: hee'l say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes
941   *<S 2> Why he shall neuer wake, vntill the great Iudge-ment
942    day.
943    <S 1> Why then hee'l say, we stab'd him sleeping.
944   *<S 2> The vrging of that word Iudgement, hath bred a
945    kinde of remorse in me.
946    <S 1> What? art thou affraid?
947    <S 2> Not to kill him, hauing a Warrant,
948    But to be damn'd for killing him, from the which
949    No Warrant can defend me.
950    <S 1> I thought thou had'st bin resolute.
951    <S 2> So I am, to let him liue.
952    <S 1> Ile backe to the Duke of Glouster, and tell him so.
953    <S 2> Nay, I prythee stay a little:
954    I hope this passionate humor of mine, will change,
955    It was wont to hold me but while one tels twenty.
956    <S 1> How do'st thou feele thy selfe now?
957   *<S 2> Some certaine dregges of conscience are yet with-in
958    mee.
959    <S 1> Remember our Reward, when the deed's done.
960    <S 2> Come, he dies: I had forgot the Reward.
961    <S 1> Where's thy conscience now.
962    <S 2> O, in the Duke of Glousters purse.
963   *<S 1> When hee opens his purse to giue vs our Reward,
964    thy Conscience flyes out.
965   *<S 2> 'Tis no matter, let it goe: There's few or none will
966    entertaine it.
967    <S 1> What if it come to thee againe?
968   *<S 2> Ile not meddle with it, it makes a man a Coward:
969   *A man cannot steale, but it accuseth him: A man cannot
970   *Sweare, but it Checkes him: A man cannot lye with his
971   *Neighbours Wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing
972   *shamefac'd spirit, that mutinies in a mans bosome: It
973   *filles a man full of Obstacles. It made me once restore a
974   *Pursse of Gold that (by chance) I found: It beggars any
975   *man that keepes it: It is turn'd out of Townes and Cit-ties
976   *for a dangerous thing, and euery man that means to
977   *liue well, endeuours to trust to himselfe, and liue with-out
978    it.
      <P r3>
979   *<S 1> 'Tis euen now at my elbow, perswading me not to
980    kill the Duke.
981   *<S 2> Take the diuell in thy minde, and beleeue him not:
982    He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
983    <S 1> I am strong fram'd, he cannot preuaile with me.
984    <S 2> Spoke like a tall man, that respects thy reputation.
985    Come, shall we fall to worke?
986   *<S 1> Take him on the Costard, with the hiltes of thy
987   *Sword, and then throw him into the Malmesey- Butte in
988    the next roome.
989    <S 2> O excellent deuice; and make a sop of him.
990    <S 1> Soft, he wakes.
991    <S 2> Strike.
992    <S 1> No, wee'l reason with him.
993   *<S {Cla}.> Where art thou Keeper? Giue me a cup of wine.
994    <S 2> You shall haue Wine enough my Lord anon.
995    <S {Cla}.> In Gods name, what art thou?
996    <S 1> A man, as you are.
997    <S {Cla}.> But not as I am Royall.
998    <S 1> Nor you as we are, Loyall.
999   *<S {Cla}.> Thy voice is Thunder, but thy looks are humble.
1000  *<S 1> My voice is now the Kings, my lookes mine owne.
1001   <S {Cla}.> How darkly, and how deadly dost thou speake?
1002   Your eyes do menace me: why looke you pale?
1003   Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
1004   <S 2> To, to, to===
1005   <S {Cla}.> To murther me?
1006   <S {Both}.> #I, #I.
1007   <S {Cla}.> You scarsely haue the hearts to tell me so,
1008   And therefore cannot haue the hearts to do it.
1009   Wherein my Friends haue I offended you?
1010   <S 1> Offended vs you haue not, but the King.
1011   <S {Cla}.> I shall be reconcil'd to him againe.
1012   <S 2> Neuer my Lord, therefore prepare to dye.
1013   <S {Cla}.> Are you drawne forth among a world of men
1014   To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
1015   Where is the Euidence that doth accuse me?
1016   What lawfull Quest haue giuen their Verdict vp
1017   Vnto the frowning Iudge? Or who pronounc'd
1018   The bitter sentence of poore {Clarence} death,
1019   Before I be conuict by course of Law?
1020   To threaten me with death, is most vnlawfull.
1021   I charge you, as you hope for any goodnesse,
1022   That you depart, and lay no hands on me:
1023   The deed you vndertake is damnable.
1024   <S 1> What we will do, we do vpon command.
1025   <S 2> And he that hath commanded, is our King.
1026   <S {Cla}.> Erroneous Vassals, the great King of Kings
1027   Hath in the Table of his Law commanded
1028   That thou shalt do no murther. Will you then
1029   Spurne at his Edict, and fulfill a Mans?
1030   Take heed: for he holds Vengeance in his hand,
1031   To hurle vpon their heads that breake his Law.
1032   <S 2> And that same Vengeance doth he hurle on thee,
1033   For false Forswearing, and for murther too:
1034   Thou did'st receiue the Sacrament, to fight
1035   In quarrell of the House of Lancaster.
1036   <S 1> And like a Traitor to the name of God,
1037  *Did'st breake that Vow, and with thy treacherous blade,
1038   Vnrip'st the Bowels of thy Sou'raignes Sonne.
1039   <S 2> Whom thou was't sworne to cherish and defend.
1040   <S 1> How canst thou vrge Gods dreadfull Law to vs,
1041   When thou hast broke it in such deere degree?
1042   <S {Cla}.> Alas! for whose sake did I that #ill deede?
1043   For {Edward}, for my Brother, for his sake.
1044   He sends you not to murther me for this:
1045   For in that sinne, he is as deepe as I.
1046   If God will be auenged for the deed,
1047   O know you yet, he doth it publiquely,
1048   Take not the quarrell from his powrefull arme:
1049   He needs no indirect, or lawlesse course,
1050   To cut off those that haue offended him.
1051   <S 1> Who made thee then a bloudy minister,
1052   When gallant springing braue {Plantagenet},
1053   That Princely Nouice was strucke dead by thee?
1054   <S {Cla}.> My Brothers loue, the Diuell, and my Rage.
1055   <S 1> Thy Brothers Loue, our Duty, and thy Faults,
1056   Prouoke vs hither now, to slaughter thee.
1057   <S {Cla}.> If you do loue my Brother, hate not me:
1058   I am his Brother, and I loue him well.
1059   If you are hyr'd for meed, go backe againe,
1060   And I will send you to my Brother Glouster:
1061   Who shall reward you better for my life,
1062   Then {Edward} will for tydings of my death.
1063   <S 2> You are deceiu'd,
1064   Your Brother Glouster hates you.
1065   <S {Cla}.> Oh no, he loues me, and he holds me deere:
1066   Go you to him from me.
1067   <S 1> #I so we will.
1068  *<S {Cla}.> Tell him, when that our Princely Father Yorke,
1069   Blest his three Sonnes with his victorious Arme,
1070   He little thought of this diuided Friendship:
1071   Bid Glouster thinke on this, and he will weepe.
1072   <S 1> #I Milstones, as he lessoned vs to weepe.
1073   <S {Cla}.> O do not slander him, for he is kinde.
1074   <S 1> Right, as Snow in Haruest:
1075   Come, you deceiue your selfe,
1076   'Tis he that sends vs to destroy you heere.
1077   <S {Cla}.> It cannot be, for he bewept my Fortune,
1078   And hugg'd me in his armes, and swore with sobs,
1079   That he would labour my deliuery.
1080   <S 1> Why so he doth, when he deliuers you
1081   From this earths thraldome, to the ioyes of heauen.
1082   <S 2> Make peace with God, for you must die my Lord.
1083   <S {Cla}.> Haue you that holy feeling in your soules,
1084   To counsaile me to make my peace with God,
1085   And are you yet to your owne soules so blinde,
1086   That you will warre with God, by murd'ring me.
1087   O sirs consider, they that set you on
1088   To do this deede will hate you for the deede.
1089   <S 2> What shall we do?
1090   <S {Clar}.> Relent, and saue your soules:
1091   Which of you, if you were a Princes Sonne,
1092   Being pent from Liberty, as I am now,
1093   If two such murtherers as your selues came to you,
1094   Would not intreat for life, as you would begge
1095   Were you in my distresse.
1096   <S 1> Relent? no: 'Tis cowardly and womanish.
1097   <S {Cla}.> Not to relent, is beastly, sauage, diuellish:
1098   My  Friend, I spy some pitty in thy lookes:
1099   O, if thine eye be not a Flatterer,
1100   Come thou on my side, and intreate for mee,
1101   A begging Prince, what begger pitties not.
1102   <S 2> Looke behinde you, my Lord.
1103   <S 1> Take that, and that, if all this will not do,  <D {Stabs him}.>
1104   Ile drowne you in the Malmesey-But within.  <D {Exit}.>
1105   <S 2> A bloody deed, and desperately dispatcht:
1106   How faine (like {Pilate}) would I wash my hands
1107   Of this most greeuous murther.  <D {Enter} 1.{#Murtherer}>
1108  *<S 1> How now? what mean'st thou that thou help'st me
1109  *not? By Heauen the Duke shall know how slacke you
1110   haue beene.
      <P r3v>
1111  *<S 2.{Mur}.> I would he knew that I had sau'd his brother,
1112   Take thou the Fee, and tell him what I say,
1113   For I repent me that the Duke is slaine.  <D {Exit}.>
1114   <S 1.{Mur}.> So do not I: go Coward as thou art.
1115   Well, Ile go hide the body in some hole,
1116   Till that the Duke giue order for his buriall:
1117   And when I haue my meede, I will away,
1118   For this will out, and then I must not stay.  <D {Exit}>
1119   <Z {Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima}.>
1120   <D {Flourish}.>
1121   <D {Enter the King sicke, the Queene, Lord Marquesse}
1122   {Dorset, Riuers, Hastings, Catesby},
1123   {Buckingham, Wooduill}.>
1124  *<S {King}.> Why so: now haue I done a good daies work.
1125   You Peeres, continue this vnited League:
1126   I, euery day expect an Embassage
1127   From my Redeemer, to redeeme me hence.
1128   And more to peace my soule shall part to heauen,
1129   Since I haue made my Friends at peace on earth.
1130   {Dorset} and {Riuers}, take each others hand,
1131   Dissemble not your hatred, Sweare your loue.
1132  *<S {Riu}.> By heauen, my soule is purg'd from grudging hate
1133   And with my hand I seale my true hearts Loue.
1134   <S {Hast}.> So thriue I, as I truly sweare the like.
1135   <S {King}.> Take heed you dally not before your King,
1136   Lest he that is the supreme King of Kings
1137   Confound your hidden falshood, and award
1138   Either of you to be the others end.
1139   <S {Hast}.> So prosper I, as I sweare perfect loue.
1140   <S {Ri}.> And I, as I loue {Hastings} with my heart,
1141   <S {King}.> Madam, your selfe is not exempt from this:
1142   Nor you Sonne {Dorset}, {Buckingham} nor you;
1143   You haue bene factious one against the other.
1144   Wife, loue Lord {Hastings}, let him kisse your hand,
1145   And what you do, do it vnfeignedly.
1146   <S {Qu}.> There {Hastings}, I will neuer more remember
1147   Our former hatred, so thriue I, and mine.
1148   <S {King}.> {Dorset}, imbrace him:
1149   {Hastings}, loue Lord Marquesse.
1150   <S {Dor}.> This interchange of loue, I heere protest
1151   Vpon my part, shall be inuiolable.
1152   <S {Hast}.> And so sweare I.
1153  *<S {King}.> Now Princely {Buckingham}, seale y this league
1154   With thy embracements to my wiues Allies,
1155   And make me happy in your vnity.
1156   <S {Buc}.> When euer {Buckingham} doth turne his hate
1157   Vpon your Grace, but with all dutious loue,
1158   Doth cherish you, and yours, God punish me
1159   With hate in those where I expect most loue,
1160   When I haue most need to imploy a Friend,
1161   And most assured that he is a Friend,
1162   Deepe, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
1163   Be he vnto me: This do I begge of heauen,
1164   When I am cold in loue, to you, or yours.  <D {Embrace}>
1165   <S {King}.> A pleasing Cordiall, Princely {Buckingham}
1166   Is this thy Vow, vnto my sickely heart:
1167   There wanteth now our Brother Gloster heere,
1168   To make the blessed period of this peace.
1169   <S {Buc}.> And in good time,
1170   Heere comes Sir {Richard Ratcliffe}, and the Duke.
1171   <D {Enter Ratcliffe, and Gloster}.>
1172  *<S {Rich}.> Good morrow to my Soueraigne King & Queen
1173   And Princely Peeres, a happy time of day.
1174   <S {King}.> Happy indeed, as we haue spent the day:
1175   Gloster, we haue done deeds of Charity,
1176   Made peace of enmity, faire loue of hate,
1177   Betweene these swelling wrong incensed Peeres.
1178   <S {Rich}.> A blessed labour my most Soueraigne Lord:
1179   Among this Princely heape, if any heere
1180   By false intelligence, or wrong surmize
1181   Hold me a Foe: If I vnwillingly, or in my rage,
1182   Haue ought committed that is hardly borne,
1183   To any in this presence, I desire
1184   To reconcile me to his Friendly peace:
1185   'Tis death to me to be at enmitie:
1186   I hate it, and desire all good mens loue,
1187   First Madam, I intreate true peace of you,
1188   Which I will purchase with my dutious seruice.
1189   Of you my Noble Cosin Buckingham,
1190   If euer any grudge were lodg'd betweene vs.
1191   Of you and you, Lord {Riuers} and of {Dorset},
1192   That all without desert haue frown'd on me:
1193   Of you Lord {Wooduill}, and Lord {Scales} of you,
1194   Dukes, Earles, Lords, Gentlemen, indeed of all.
1195   I do not know that Englishman aliue,
1196   With whom my soule is any iot at oddes,
1197   More then the Infant that is borne to night:
1198   I thanke my God for my Humility.
1199   <S {Qu}.> A holy day shall this be kept heereafter:
1200   I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
1201   My Soueraigne Lord, I do beseech your Highnesse
1202   To take our Brother {Clarence} to your Grace.
1203   <S {Rich}.> Why Madam, haue I offred loue for this,
1204   To be so flowted in this Royall presence?
1205   Who knowes not that the gentle Duke is dead?  <D {They} |({all start}.>
1206   You do him iniurie to scorne his Coarse.
1207   <S {King}.> Who knowes not he is dead?
1208   Who knowes he is?
1209   <S {Qu}.> All- seeing heauen, what a world is this?
1210   <S {Buc}.> Looke I so pale Lord {Dorset}, as the rest?
1211   <S {Dor}.> #I my good Lord, and no man in the presence,
1212   But his red colour hath forsooke his cheekes.
1213   <S {King}.> Is {Clarence} dead? The Order was reuerst.
1214   <S {Rich}.> But he (poore man) by your first order dyed,
1215   And that a winged Mercurie did beare:
1216   Some tardie Cripple bare the Countermand,
1217   That came too lagge to see him buried.
1218   God grant, that some lesse Noble, and lesse Loyall,
1219   Neerer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,
1220   Deserue not worse then wretched {Clarence} did,
1221   And yet go currant from Suspition.
1222   <D {Enter Earle of Derby}.>
1223   <S {Der}.> A boone my Soueraigne for my seruice done.
1224   <S {King}.> I prethee peace, my soule is full of sorrow.
1225   <S {Der}.> I will not rise, vnlesse your Highnes heare me.
1226   <S {King}.> Then say at once, what is it thou requests.
1227   <S {Der}.> The forfeit (Soueraigne) of my seruants life,
1228   Who slew to day a Riotous Gentleman,
1229   Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolke.
1230  *<S {King}.> Haue I a tongue to doome my Brothers death?
1231   And shall that tongue giue pardon to a slaue?
1232   My Brother kill'd no man, his fault was Thought,
1233   And yet his punishment was bitter death.
      <P r4>
1234   Who sued to me for him? Who (in my wrath)
1235   Kneel'd and my feet, and bid me be aduis'd?
1236   Who spoke of Brother- hood? who spoke of loue?
1237   Who told me how the poore soule did forsake
1238   The mighty Warwicke, and did fight for me?
1239   Who told me in the field at Tewkesbury,
1240   When Oxford had me downe, he rescued me:
1241   And said deare Brother liue, and be a King?
1242   Who told me, when we both lay in the Field,
1243   Frozen (almost) to death, how he did lap me
1244   Euen in his Garments, and did giue himselfe
1245   (All thin and naked) to the numbe cold night?
1246   All this from my Remembrance, brutish wrath
1247   Sinfully pluckt, and not a man of you
1248   Had so much grace to put it in my minde.
1249   But when your Carters, or your wayting Vassalls
1250   Haue done a drunken Slaughter, and defac'd
1251   The precious Image of our deere Redeemer,
1252   You straight are on your knees for Pardon, pardon,
1253   And I (vniustly too) must grant it you.
1254   But for my Brother, not a man would speake,
1255   Nor I (vngracious) speake vnto my selfe
1256   For him poore Soule. The proudest of you all,
1257   Haue bin beholding to him in his life:
1258   Yet none of you, would once begge for his life.
1259   O God! I feare thy iustice will take hold
1260   On me, and you; and mine, and yours for this.
1261   Come {Hastings} helpe me to my Closset.
1262   Ah poore {Clarence}.  <D {Exeunt some with K[ing]. & Queen}.>
1263   <S {Rich}.> This is the fruits of rashnes: Markt you not,
1264   How that the guilty Kindred of the Queene
1265   Look'd pale, when they did heare of {Clarence} death.
1266   O! they did vrge it still vnto the King,
1267   God will reuenge it. Come Lords will you go,
1268   To comfort {Edward} with our company.
1269   <S {Buc}.> We wait vpon your Grace.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1270   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1271   <D {Enter the old Dutchesse of Yorke, with the two}
1272   {children of Clarence}.>
1273   <S {Edw}.> Good Grandam tell vs, is our Father dead?
1274   <S {Dutch}.> No Boy.
1275  *<S {Daugh}.> Why do weepe so oft? And beate your Brest?
1276   And cry, O {Clarence}, my vnhappy Sonne.
1277   <S {Boy}.> Why do you looke on vs, and shake your head,
1278   And call vs Orphans, Wretches, Castawayes,
1279   If that our Noble Father were aliue?
1280   <S {Dut}.> My pretty Cosins, you mistake me both,
1281   I do lament the sicknesse of the King,
1282   As loath to lose him, not your Fathers death:
1283   It were lost sorrow to waile one that's lost.
1284   <S {Boy}.> Then you conclude, (my Grandam) he is dead:
1285   The King mine Vnckle is #too blame for it.
1286   God will reuenge it, whom I will importune
1287   With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
1288   <S {Daugh}.> And so will I.
1289  *<S {Dut}.> Peace children peace, the King doth loue you wel.
1290   Incapeable, and shallow Innocents,
1291   You cannot guesse who caus'd your Fathers death.
1292   <S {Boy}.> Grandam we can: for my good Vnkle Gloster
1293   Told me, the King prouok'd to it by the Queene,
1294   Deuis'd impeachments to imprison him;
1295   And when my Vnckle told me so, he wept,
1296   And pittied me, and kindly kist my cheeke:
1297   Bad me rely on him, as on my Father,
1298   And he would loue me deerely as a childe.
1299  *<S {Dut}.> Ah! that Deceit should steale such gentle shape,
1300   And with a vertuous Vizor hide deepe vice.
1301   He is my sonne, #I, and therein my shame,
1302   Yet from my dugges, he drew not this deceit.
1303  *<S {Boy}.> Thinke you my Vnkle did dissemble Grandam?
1304   <S {Dut}.> #I Boy.
1305   <S {Boy}.> I cannot thinke it. Hearke, what noise is this?
1306   <D {Enter the Queene with her haire about her ears},
1307   {Riuers & Dorset after her}.>
1308   <S {Qu}.> Ah! who shall hinder me to waile and weepe?
1309   To chide my Fortune, and torment my Selfe.
1310   Ile ioyne with blacke dispaire against my Soule,
1311   And to my selfe, become an enemie.
1312   <S {Dut}.> What meanes this Scene of rude impatience?
1313   <S {Qu}.> To make an act of Tragicke violence.
1314   {Edward} my Lord, thy Sonne, our King is dead.
1315   Why grow the Branches, when the Roote is gone?
1316   Why wither not the leaues that want their sap?
1317   If you will liue, Lament: if dye, be breefe,
1318   That our swift- winged Soules may catch the Kings,
1319   Or like obedient Subiects follow him,
1320   To his new Kingdome of nere- changing night.
1321   <S {Dut}.> Ah so much interest haue in thy sorrow,
1322   As I had Title in thy Noble Husband:
1323   I haue bewept a worthy Husbands death,
1324   And liu'd with looking on his Images:
1325   But now two Mirrors of his Princely semblance,
1326   Are crack'd in pieces, by malignant death,
1327   And I for comfort, haue but one false Glasse,
1328   That greeues me, when I see my shame in him.
1329   Thou art a Widdow: yet thou art a Mother,
1330   And hast the comfort of thy Children left,
1331  *But death hath snatch'd my Husband from mine Armes,
1332   And pluckt two Crutches from my feeble hands,
1333   {Clarence}, and {Edward}. O, what cause haue I,
1334   (Thine being but a moity of my moane)
1335   To ouer- go thy woes, and drowne thy cries.
1336   <S {Boy}.> Ah Aunt! you wept not for our Fathers death:
1337   How can we ayde you with our Kindred teares?
1338   <S {Daugh}.> Our fatherlesse distresse was left vnmoan'd,
1339   Your widdow- dolour, likewise be vnwept.
1340   <S {Qu}.> Giue me no helpe in Lamentation,
1341   I am not barren to bring forth complaints:
1342   All Springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
1343   That I being gouern'd by the waterie Moone,
1344   May send forth plenteous teares to drowne the World.
1345   Ah, for my Husband, for my deere Lord {Edward}.
1346  *<S {Chil}.> Ah for our Father, for our deere Lord {Clarence}.
1347   <S {Dut}.> Alas for both, both mine {Edward} and {Clarence}.
1348   <S {Qu}.> What stay had I but {Edward}, and hee's gone?
1349   <S {Chil}.> What stay had we but {Clarence}? and he's gone.
1350  *<S {Dut}.> What stayes had I, but they? and they are gone.
1351   <S {Qu}.> Was neuer widdow had so deere a losse.
1352   <S {Chil}.> Were neuer Orphans had so deere a losse.
1353   <S {Dut}.> Was neuer Mother had so deere a losse.
1354   Alas! I am the Mother of these Greefes,
1355   Their woes are parcell'd, mine is generall.
1356   She for an {Edward} weepes, and so do I:
      <P r4v>
1357   I for a {Clarence} weepes, so doth not shee:
1358   These Babes for {Clarence} weepe, so do not they.
1359   Alas! you three, on me threefold distrest:
1360   Power all your teares, I am your sorrowes Nurse,
1361   And I will pamper it with Lamentation.
1362   <S {Dor}.> Comfort deere Mother, God is much displeas'd,
1363   That you take with vnthankfulnesse his doing.
1364   In common worldly things, 'tis call'd vngratefull,
1365   With dull vnwillingnesse to repay a debt,
1366   Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent:
1367   Much more to be thus opposite with heauen,
1368   For it requires the Royall debt it lent you.
1369   <S {Riuers}.> Madam, bethinke you like a carefull Mother
1370   Of the young Prince your sonne: send straight for him,
1371   Let him be Crown'd, in him your comfort liues.
1372   Drowne desperate sorrow in dead {Edwards} graue,
1373   And plant your ioyes in liuing {Edwards} Throne.
1374   <D {Enter Richard, Buckingham, Derbie, Ha-stings},
1375   {and Ratcliffe}.>
1376   <S {Rich}.> Sister haue comfort, all of vs haue cause
1377   To waile the dimming of our shining Starre:
1378   But none can helpe our harmes by wayling them.
1379   Madam, my Mother, I do cry you mercie,
1380   I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee,
1381   I craue your Blessing.
1382  *<S {Dut}.> God blesse thee, and put meeknes in thy breast,
1383   Loue Charity, Obedience, and true Dutie.
1384   <S {Rich}.> Amen, and make me die a good old man,
1385   That is the butt- end of a Mothers blessing;
1386   I maruell that her Grace did leaue it out.
1387  *<S {Buc}.> You clowdy- Princes, & hart- sorowing- Peeres,
1388   That beare this heauie mutuall loade of Moane,
1389   Now cheere each other, in each others Loue:
1390   Though we haue spent our Haruest of this King,
1391   We are to reape the Haruest of his Sonne.
1392   The broken rancour of your high- swolne hates,
1393   But lately splinter'd, knit, and ioyn'd together,
1394   Must gently be preseru'd, cherisht, and kept:
1395   Me seemeth good, that with some little Traine,
1396   Forthwith from Ludlow, the young Prince be set
1397   Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.
1398   <S {Riuers}.> Why with some little Traine,
1399   My Lord of Buckingham?
1400   <S {Buc}.> Marrie my Lord, least by a multitude,
1401   The new- heal'd wound of Malice should breake out,
1402   Which would be so much the more dangerous,
1403   By how much the estate is greene, and yet vngouern'd.
1404   Where euery Horse beares his commanding Reine,
1405   And may direct his course as please himselfe,
1406   As well the feare of harme, as harme apparant,
1407   In my opinion, ought to be preuented.
1408   <S {Rich}.> I hope the King made peace with all of vs,
1409   And the compact is firme, and true in me.
1410   <S {Riu}.> And so in me, and so (I thinke) in all.
1411   Yet since it is but greene, it should be put
1412   To no apparant likely- hood of breach,
1413   Which haply by much company might be vrg'd:
1414   Therefore I say with Noble Buckingham,
1415   That it is meete so few should fetch the Prince.
1416   <S {Hast}.> And so say I.
1417   <S {Rich}.> Then be it so, and go we to determine
1418   Who they shall be that strait shall poste to London.
1419   Madam, and you my Sister, will you go
1420   To giue your censures in this businesse.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1421   <D {Manet Buckingham, and Richard}.>
1422   <S {Buc}.> My Lord, who euer iournies to the Prince,
1423   For God sake let not vs two stay at home:
1424   For by the way, Ile sort occasion,
1425   As Index to the story we late talk'd of,
1426   To part the Queenes proud Kindred from the Prince.
1427   <S {Rich}.> My other selfe, my Counsailes Consistory,
1428   My Oracle, My Prophet, my deere Cosin,
1429   I, as a childe, will go by thy direction,
1430  *Toward London then, for wee'l not stay behinde.  <D {Exeunt}>
1431   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
1432   <D {Enter one Citizen at one doore, and another at}
1433   {the other}.>
1434  *<S 1.{Cit}.> Good morrow Neighbour, whether away so
1435   fast?
1436   <S 2.{Cit}.> I promise you, I scarsely know my selfe:
1437   Heare you the newes abroad?
1438   <S 1.> Yes, that the King is dead.
1439   <S 2.> #Ill newes byrlady, seldome comes the better:
1440   I feare, I feare, 'twill proue a giddy world.
1441   <D {Enter another Citizen}.>
1442   <S 3.> Neighbours, God speed.
1443   <S 1.> Giue you good morrow sir.
1444  *<S 3.> Doth the newes hold of good king {Edwards} death?
1445   <S 2.> #I sir, it is too true, God helpe the while.
1446   <S 3.> Then Masters looke to see a troublous world.
1447   <S 1.> No, no, by Gods good grace, his Son shall reigne.
1448   <S 3.> Woe to that Land that's gouern'd by a Childe.
1449   <S 2.> In him there is a hope of Gouernment,
1450   Which in his nonage, counsell vnder him,
1451   And in his full and ripened yeares, himselfe
1452   No doubt shall then, and till then gouerne well.
1453   <S 1.> So stood the State, when {Henry} the sixt
1454   Was crown'd in Paris, but at nine months old.
1455  *<S 3.> Stood the State so? No, no, good friends, God wot
1456   For then this Land was famously enrich'd
1457   With politike graue Counsell; then the King
1458   Had vertuous Vnkles to protect his Grace.
1459  *<S 1.> Why so hath this, both by his Father and Mother.
1460   <S 3.> Better it were they all came by his Father:
1461   Or by his Father there were none at all:
1462   For emulation, who shall now be neerest,
1463   Will touch vs all too neere, if God preuent not.
1464   O full of danger is the Duke of Glouster,
1465  *And the Queenes Sons, and Brothers, haught and proud:
1466   And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
1467   This sickly Land, might solace as before.
1468   <S 1.> Come, come, we feare the worst: all will be well.
1469  *<S 3.> When Clouds are seen, wisemen put on their clokes;
1470   When great leaues fall, then Winter is at hand;
1471   When the Sun sets, who doth not looke for night?
1472   Vntimely stormes, makes men expect a Dearth:
1473   All may be well; but if God sort it so,
1474   'Tis more then we deserue, or I expect.
1475   <S 2.> Truly, the hearts of men are full of feare:
1476   You cannot reason (almost) with a man,
1477   That lookes not heauily, and full of dread.
1478   <S 3.> Before the dayes of Change, still is it so,
1479   By a diuine instinct, mens mindes mistrust
      <P r5>
1480   Pursuing danger: as by proofe we see
1481   The Water swell before a boyst'rous storme:
1482   But leaue it all to God. Whither away?
1483   <S 2> Marry we were sent for to the Iustices.
1484   <S 3> And so was I: Ile beare you company.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1485   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1486   <D {Enter Arch- bishop, yong Yorke, the Queene},
1487   {and the Dutchesse}.>
1488  *<S {Arch}.> Last night I heard they lay at Stony Stratford,
1489   And at Northampton they do rest to night:
1490   To morrow, or next day, they will be heere.
1491   <S {Dut}.> I long with all my heart to see the Prince:
1492   I hope he is much growne since last I saw him.
1493   <S {Qu}.> But I heare no, they say my sonne of Yorke
1494   Ha's almost ouertane him in his growth.
1495   <S {Yorke}.> #I Mother, but I would not haue it so.
1496   <S {Dut}.> Why my good Cosin, it is good to grow.
1497   <S {Yor}.> Grandam, one night as we did sit at Supper,
1498   My Vnkle {Riuers} talk'd how I did grow
1499   More then my Brother. #I, quoth my Vnkle Glouster,
1500   Small Herbes haue grace, great Weeds do grow apace.
1501   And since, me thinkes I would not grow so fast,
1502   Because sweet Flowres are slow, and Weeds make #hast.
1503   <S {Dut}.> Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
1504   In him that did obiect the same to thee.
1505   He was the wretched'st thing when he was yong,
1506   So long #a growing, and so leysurely,
1507   That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
1508   <S {Yor}.> And so no doubt he is, my gracious Madam.
1509   <S {Dut}.> I hope he is, but yet let Mothers doubt.
1510   <S {Yor}.> Now by my troth, if I had beene remembred,
1511   I could haue giuen my Vnkles Grace, a flout,
1512   To touch his growth, neerer then he toucht mine.
1513   <S {Dut}.> How my yong Yorke,
1514   I prythee let me heare it.
1515   <S {Yor}.> Marry (they say) my Vnkle grew so fast,
1516   That he could gnaw a crust at two houres old,
1517   'Twas full two yeares ere I could get a tooth.
1518   Grandam, this would haue beene a byting Iest.
1519   <S {Dut}.> I prythee pretty Yorke, who told thee this?
1520   <S {Yor}.> Grandam, his Nursse.
1521  *<S {Dut}.> His Nurse? why she was dead, ere y wast borne.
1522   <S {Yor}.> If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
1523   <S {Qu}.> A parlous Boy: go #too, you are too shrew'd.
1524   <S {Dut}.> Good Madam, be not angry with the Childe.
1525   <S {Qu}.> Pitchers haue eares.
1526   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1527   <S {Arch}.> Heere comes a Messenger: What Newes?
1528   <S {Mes}.> Such newes my Lord, as greeues me to report.
1529   <S {Qu}.> How doth the Prince?
1530   <S {Mes}.> Well Madam, and in health.
1531   <S {Dut}.> What is thy Newes?
1532   <S {Mess}.> Lord {Riuers}, and Lord {Grey},
1533   Are sent to Pomfret, and with them,
1534   Sir {Thomas Vaughan}, Prisoners.
1535   <S {Dut}.> Who hath committed them?
1536   <S {Mes}.> The mighty Dukes, {Glouster} and {Buckingham}.
1537   <S {Arch}.> For what offence?
1538   <S {Mes}.> The summe of all I can, I haue disclos'd:
1539   Why, or for what, the Nobles were committed,
1540   Is all vnknowne to me, my gracious Lord.
1541   <S {Qu}.> Aye me! I see the ruine of my House:
1542   The Tyger now hath seiz'd the gentle Hinde,
1543   Insulting Tiranny beginnes to Iutt
1544   Vpon the innocent and awelesse Throne:
1545   Welcome Destruction, Blood, and Massacre,
1546   I see (as in a Map) the end of all.
1547   <S {Dut}.> Accursed, and vnquiet wrangling dayes,
1548   How many of you haue mine eyes beheld?
1549   My Husband lost his life, to get the Crowne,
1550   And often vp and downe my sonnes were tost
1551   For me to ioy, and weepe, their gaine and losse.
1552   And being seated, and Domesticke broyles
1553   Cleane ouer- blowne, themselues the Conquerors,
1554   Make warre vpon themselues, Brother to Brother;
1555   Blood to blood, selfe against selfe: O prepostorous
1556   And franticke outrage, end thy damned spleene,
1557   Or let me dye, to looke on earth no more.
1558   <S {Qu}.> Come, come my Boy, we will to Sanctuary.
1559   Madam, farwell.
1560   <S {Dut}.> Stay, I will go with you.
1561   <S {Qu}.> You haue no cause.
1562   <S {Arch}.> My gracious Lady go,
1563   And thether beare your Treasure and your Goodes,
1564   For my part, Ile resigne vnto your Grace
1565   The Seale I keepe, and so betide to me,
1566   As well I tender you, and all of yours.
1567   Go, Ile conduct you to the Sanctuary.  <D {Exeunt}>
1568   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scoena Prima}.>
1569   <D {The Trumpets sound}.>
1570  *<D {Enter yong Prince, the Dukes of Glocester, and Buckingham},
1571   {Lord Cardinall, with others}.>
1572   <S {Buc}.> Welcome sweete Prince to London,
1573   To your Chamber.
1574  *<S {Rich}.> Welcome deere Cosin, my thoughts Soueraign
1575   The wearie way hath made you Melancholly.
1576   <S {Prin}.> No Vnkle, but our crosses on the way,
1577   Haue made it tedious, wearisome, and heauie.
1578   I want more Vnkles heere to welcome me.
1579  *<S {Rich}.> Sweet Prince, the vntainted vertue of your yeers
1580   Hath not yet diu'd into the Worlds deceit:
1581   No more can you distinguish of a man,
1582   Then of his outward shew, which God he knowes,
1583   Seldome or neuer iumpeth with the heart.
1584   Those Vnkles which you want, were dangerous:
1585   Your Grace attended to their Sugred words,
1586   But look'd not on the poyson of their hearts:
1587   God keepe you from them, and from such false Friends.
1588   <S {Prin}.> God keepe me from false Friends,
1589   But they were none.
1590  *<S {Rich}.> My Lord, the Maior of London comes to greet
1591   you.
1592   <D {Enter Lord Maior}.>
1593  *<S {Lo.Maior}.> God blesse your Grace, with health and
1594   happie dayes.
1595  *<S {Prin}.> I thanke you, good my Lord, and thank you all:
      <P r5v><C A>
1596   I thought my Mother, and my Brother {Yorke},
1597   Would long, ere this, haue met vs on the way.
1598   Fie, what a Slug is {Hastings}, that he comes not
1599   To tell vs, whether they will come, or no.
1600   <D {Enter Lord Hastings}.>
1601  *<S {Buck}.> And in good time, heere comes the sweating
1602   Lord.
1603  *<S {Prince}.> Welcome, my Lord: what, will our Mother
1604   come?
1605   <S {Hast}.> On what occasion God he knowes, not I;
1606   The Queene your Mother, and your Brother {Yorke},
1607   Haue taken Sanctuarie: The tender Prince
1608   Would faine haue come with me, to meet your Grace,
1609   But by his Mother was perforce with- held.
1610   <S {Buck}.> Fie, what an indirect and peeuish course
1611   Is this of hers? Lord Cardinall, will your Grace
1612   Perswade the Queene, to send the Duke of Yorke
1613   Vnto his Princely Brother presently?
1614   If she denie, Lord {Hastings} goe with him,
1615   And from her iealous Armes pluck him perforce.
1616   <S {Card}.> My Lord of Buckingham, if my weake Oratorie
1617   Can from his Mother winne the Duke of Yorke,
1618   Anon expect him here: but if she be obdurate
1619   To milde entreaties, God forbid
1620   We should infringe the holy Priuiledge
1621   Of blessed Sanctuarie: not for all this Land,
1622   Would I be guiltie of so great a sinne.
1623   <S {Buck}.> You are too sencelesse obstinate, my Lord,
1624   Too ceremonious, and traditionall.
1625   Weigh it but with the grossenesse of this Age,
1626   You breake not Sanctuarie, in seizing him:
1627   The benefit thereof is alwayes granted
1628   To those, whose dealings haue deseru'd the place,
1629   And those who haue the wit to clayme the place:
1630   This Prince hath neyther claym'd it, nor deseru'd it,
1631   And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot haue it.
1632   Then taking him from thence, that is not there,
1633   You breake no Priuiledge, nor Charter there:
1634   Oft haue I heard of Sanctuarie men,
1635   But Sanctuarie children, ne're till now.
1636  *<S {Card}.> My Lord, you shall o're- rule my mind for once.
1637   Come on, Lord {Hastings}, will you goe with me?
1638   <S {Hast}.> I goe, my Lord.  <D {Exit Cardinall and Hastings}.>
1639  *<S {Prince}.> Good Lords, make all the speedie #hast you may.
1640   Say, Vnckle {Glocester}, if our Brother come,
1641   Where shall we soiourne, till our Coronation?
1642   <S {Glo}.> Where it think'st best vnto your Royall selfe.
1643   If I may counsaile you, some day or two
1644   Your Highnesse shall repose you at the Tower:
1645   Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
1646   For your best health, and recreation.
1647   <S {Prince}.> I doe not like the Tower, of any place:
1648   Did {Iulius Caesar} build that place, my Lord?
1649   <S {Buck}.> He did, my gracious Lord, begin that place,
1650   Which since, succeeding Ages haue re- edify'd.
1651   <S {Prince}.> Is it vpon record? or else reported
1652   Successiuely from age to age, he built it?
1653   <S {Buck}.> Vpon record, my gracious Lord.
1654   <S {Prince}.> But say, my Lord, it were not registred,
1655   Me thinkes the truth should liue from age to age,
1656   As 'twere retayl'd to all posteritie,
1657   Euen to the generall ending day.
1658   <S {Glo}.> So wise, so young, they say doe neuer liue long.
1659   <S {Prince}.> What say you, Vnckle?
1660   <S {Glo}.> I say, without Characters, Fame liues long.
1661   Thus, like the formall Vice, Iniquitie,
1662   I morallize two meanings in one word.
1663   <S {Prince}.> That {Iulius Caesar} was a famous man,
1664   With what his Valour did enrich his Wit,
1665   His Wit set downe, to make his Valour liue:
1666   Death makes no Conquest of his Conqueror,
1667   For now he liues in Fame, though not in Life.
1668   Ile tell you what, my Cousin {Buckingham}.
1669   <S {Buck}.> What, my gracious Lord?
1670   <S {Prince}.> #And if I liue vntill I be a man,
1671   Ile win our ancient Right in France againe,
1672   Or dye a Souldier, as I liu'd a King.
1673   <S {Glo}.> Short Summers lightly haue a forward Spring.
1674   <D {Enter young Yorke, Hastings, and Cardinall}.>
1675  *<S {Buck}.> Now in good time, heere comes the Duke of
1676   Yorke.
1677  *<S {Prince}.> {Richard} of Yorke, how fares our Noble Bro-ther?
1678  _
1679   <S {Yorke}.> Well, my deare Lord, so must I call you now.
1680   <S {Prince}.> #I, Brother, to our griefe, as it is yours:
1681   Too late he dy'd, that might haue kept that Title,
1682   Which by his death hath lost much Maiestie.
1683   <S {Glo}.> How fares our Cousin, Noble Lord of Yorke?
1684   <S {Yorke}.> I thanke you, gentle Vnckle. O my Lord,
1685   You said, that idle Weeds are fast in growth:
1686   The Prince, my Brother, hath out- growne me farre.
1687   <S {Glo}.> He hath, my Lord.
1688   <S {Yorke}.> And therefore is he idle?
1689   <S {Glo}.> Oh my faire Cousin, I must not say so.
1690   <S {Yorke}.> Then he is more beholding to you, then I.
1691   <S {Glo}.> He may command me as my Soueraigne,
1692   But you haue power in me, as in a Kinsman.
1693   <S {Yorke}.> I pray you, Vnckle, giue me this Dagger.
1694   <S {Glo}.> My Dagger, little Cousin? with all my heart.
1695   <S {Prince}.> A Begger, Brother?
1696   <S {Yorke}.> Of my kind Vnckle, that I know will giue,
1697   And being but a Toy, which is no griefe to giue.
1698   <S {Glo}.> A greater gift then that, Ile giue my Cousin.
1699   <S {Yorke}.> A greater gift? O, that's the Sword to it.
1700   <S {Glo}.> #I, gentle Cousin, were it light enough.
1701  *<S {Yorke}.> O then I see, you will part but with light gifts,
1702   In weightier things you'le say a Begger nay.
1703   <S {Glo}.> It is too weightie for your Grace to weare.
1704   <S {Yorke}.> I weigh it lightly, were it heauier.
1705  *<S {Glo}.> What, would you haue my Weapon, little Lord?
1706  *<S {Yorke}.> I would that I might thanke you, as, as, you
1707   call me.
1708   <S {Glo}.> How?
1709   <S {Yorke}.> Little.
1710  *<S {Prince}.> My Lord of Yorke will still be crosse in talke:
1711   Vnckle, your Grace knowes how to beare with him.
1712  *<S {Yorke}.> You meane to beare me, not to beare with me:
1713   Vnckle, my Brother mockes both you and me,
1714   Because that I am little, like an Ape,
1715  *He thinkes that you should beare me on your shoulders.
1716   <S {Buck}.> With what a sharpe prouided wit he reasons:
1717   To mittigate the scorne he giues his Vnckle,
1718   He prettily and aptly taunts himselfe:
1719   So cunning, and so young, is wonderfull.
1720   <S {Glo}.> My Lord, #wilt please you passe along?
1721   My selfe, and my good Cousin {Buckingham},
1722   Will to your Mother, to entreat of her
1723   To meet you at the Tower, and welcome you.
      <P r6>
1724  *<S {Yorke}.> what, will you goe vnto the Tower, my Lord?
1725   <S {Prince}.> My Lord Protector will haue it so.
1726   <S {Yorke}.> I shall not sleepe in quiet at the Tower.
1727   <S {Glo}.> Why, what should you feare?
1728   <S {Yorke}.> Marry, my Vnckle {Clarence} angry Ghost:
1729   My Grandam told me he was murther'd there.
1730   <S {Prince}.> I feare no Vnckles dead.
1731   <S {Glo}.> Nor none that liue, I hope.
1732   <S {Prince}.> #And if they liue, I hope I need not feare.
1733   But come my Lord: and with a heauie heart,
1734   Thinking on them, goe I vnto the Tower.
1735   <D {A Senet. Exeunt Prince, Yorke, Hastings, and Dorset}.>
1736   <D {Manet Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby}.>
1737   <S {Buck}.> Thinke you, my Lord, this little prating {Yorke}
1738   Was not incensed by his subtile Mother,
1739   To taunt and scorne you thus opprobriously?
1740   <S {Glo}.> No doubt, no doubt: Oh 'tis a perillous Boy,
1741   Bold, quicke, ingenious, forward, capable:
1742   Hee is all the Mothers, from the top to toe.
1743   <S {Buck}.> Well, let them rest: Come hither {Catesby},
1744   Thou art sworne as deepely to effect what we intend,
1745   As closely to conceale what we impart:
1746   Thou know'st our reasons vrg'd vpon the way.
1747   What think'st thou? is it not an easie matter,
1748   To make {William} Lord {Hastings} of our minde,
1749   For the installment of this Noble Duke
1750   In the Seat Royall of this famous #Ile?
1751   <S {Cates}.> He for his fathers sake so loues the Prince,
1752   That he will not be wonne to ought against him.
1753  *<S {Buck}.> What think'st thou then of {Stanley}? Will
1754   not hee?
1755   <S {Cates}.> Hee will doe all in all as {Hastings} doth.
1756   <S {Buck}.> Well then, no more but this:
1757   Goe gentle {Catesby}, and as it were farre off,
1758   Sound thou Lord {Hastings},
1759   How he doth stand affected to our purpose,
1760   And summon him to morrow to the Tower,
1761   To sit about the Coronation.
1762   If thou do'st finde him tractable to vs,
1763   Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons:
1764   If he be leaden, ycie, cold, vnwilling,
1765   Be thou so too, and so breake off the talke,
1766   And giue vs notice of his inclination:
1767   For we to morrow hold diuided Councels,
1768   Wherein thy selfe shalt highly be employ'd.
1769  *<S {Rich}.> Commend me to Lord {William}: tell him {Catesby},
1770   His ancient Knot of dangerous Aduersaries
1771   To morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,
1772   And bid my Lord, for ioy of this good newes,
1773   Giue Mistresse {Shore} one gentle Kisse the more.
1774  *<S {Buck}.> Good {Catesby}, goe effect this businesse soundly.
1775   <S {Cates}.> My good Lords both, with all the heed I can.
1776  *<S {Rich}.> Shall we heare from you, {Catesby}, ere we sleepe?
1777   <S {Cates}.> You shall, my Lord.
1778   <S {Rich}.> At {Crosby} House, there shall you find vs both.
1779   <D {Exit Catesby}.>
1780   <S {Buck}.> Now, my Lord,
1781   What shall wee doe, if wee perceiue
1782   Lord {Hastings} will not yeeld to our Complots?
1783   <S {Rich}.> Chop off his Head:
1784   Something wee will determine:
1785   And looke when I am King, clayme thou of me
1786   The Earledome of Hereford, and all the moueables
1787   Whereof the King, my Brother, was possest.
1788   <S {Buck}.> Ile clayme that promise at your Graces hand.
1789  *<S {Rich}.> And looke to haue it yeelded with all kindnesse.
1790   Come, let vs suppe betimes, that afterwards
1791   Wee may digest our complots in some forme.
1792   <D {Exeunt}.>
1793   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1794   <D {Enter a Messenger to the Doore of Hastings}.>
1795   <S {Mess}.> My Lord, my Lord.
1796   <S {Hast}.> Who knockes?
1797   <S {Mess}.> One from the Lord {Stanley}.
1798   <S {Hast}.> What is't #a Clocke?
1799   <S {Mess}.> Vpon the stroke of foure.
1800   <D {Enter Lord Hastings}.>
1801  *<S {Hast}.> Cannot my Lord {Stanley} sleepe these tedious
1802   Nights?
1803   <S {Mess}.> So it appeares, by that I  haue to say:
1804   First, he commends him to your Noble selfe.
1805   <S {Hast}.> What then?
1806   <S {Mess}.> Then certifies your Lordship, that this Night
1807   He dreamt, the Bore had rased off his Helme:
1808   Besides, he sayes there are two Councels kept;
1809   And that may be determin'd at the one,
1810   Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
1811   Therefore he sends to know your Lordships pleasure,
1812   If you will presently take Horse with him,
1813   And with all speed post with him toward the North,
1814   To shun the danger that his Soule diuines.
1815   <S {Hast}.> Goe fellow, goe, returne vnto thy Lord,
1816   Bid him not feare the seperated Councell:
1817   His Honor and my selfe are at the one,
1818   And at the other, is my good friend {Catesby};
1819   Where nothing can proceede, that toucheth vs,
1820   Whereof I shall not haue intelligence:
1821   Tell him his Feares are shallow, without instance.
1822   And for his Dreames, I wonder hee's so simple,
1823   To trust the mock'ry of vnquiet slumbers.
1824   To flye the Bore, before the Bore pursues,
1825   Were to incense the Bore to follow vs,
1826   And make pursuit, where he did meane no chase.
1827   Goe, bid thy Master rise, and come to me,
1828   And we will both together to the Tower,
1829   Where he shall see the Bore will vse vs kindly.
1830   <S {Mess}.> Ile goe, my Lord, and tell him what you say.
1831   <D {Exit}.>
1832   <D {Enter Catesby}.>
1833   <S {Cates}.> Many good morrowes to my Noble Lord.
1834   <S {Hast}.> Good morrow {Catesby}, you are early stirring:
1835   What newes, what newes, in this our tott'ring State?
1836   <S {Cates}.> It is a reeling World indeed, my Lord:
1837   And I beleeue will neuer stand vpright,
1838   Till {Richard} weare the Garland of the Realme.
1839   <S {Hast}.> How weare the Garland?
1840   Doest thou meane the Crowne?
1841   <S {Cates}.> #I, my good Lord.
1842  *<S {Hast}.> Ile haue this Crown of mine cut fro[m] my shoulders,
1843   Before Ile see the Crowne so foule mis- plac'd:
1844   But canst thou guesse, that he doth ayme at it?
      <P r6v>
1845   <S {Cates}.> #I, on my life, and hopes to find you forward,
1846   Vpon his partie, for the gaine thereof:
1847   And thereupon he sends you this good newes,
1848   That this same very day your enemies,
1849   The Kindred of the Queene, must dye at Pomfret.
1850   <S {Hast}.> Indeed I am no mourner for that newes,
1851   Because they haue beene still my aduersaries:
1852   But, that Ile giue my voice on {Richards} side,
1853   To barre my Masters Heires in true Descent,
1854   God knowes I will not doe it, to the death.
1855  *<S {Cates}.> God keepe your Lordship in that gracious
1856   minde.
1857  *<S {Hast}.> But I shall laugh at this a twelue- month hence,
1858   That they which brought me in my Masters hate,
1859   I liue to looke vpon their Tragedie.
1860   Well {Catesby}, ere a fort- night make me older,
1861   Ile send some packing, that yet thinke not on't.
1862   <S {Cates}.> 'Tis a vile thing to dye, my gracious Lord,
1863   When men are vnprepar'd, and looke not for it.
1864   <S {Hast}.> O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
1865   With {Riuers, Vaughan, Grey}: and so 'twill doe
1866   With some men else, that thinke themselues as safe
1867   As thou and I, who (as thou know'st) are deare
1868   To Princely {Richard}, and to {Buckingham}.
1869   <S {Cates}.> The Princes both make high account of you,
1870   For they account his Head vpon the Bridge.
1871   <S {Hast}.> I know they doe, and I haue well deseru'd it.
1872   <D {Enter Lord Stanley}.>
1873   Come on, come on, where is your Bore- speare man?
1874   Feare you the Bore, and goe so vnprouided?
1875  *<S {Stan}.> My Lord good morrow, good morrow {Catesby}:
1876   You may ieast on, but by the holy Rood,
1877   I doe not like these seuerall Councels, I.
1878   <S {Hast}.> My Lord, I hold my Life as deare as yours,
1879   And neuer in my dayes, I doe protest,
1880   Was it so precious to me, as 'tis now:
1881   Thinke you, but that I know our state secure,
1882   I would be so triumphant as I am?
1883  *<S {Sta}.> The Lords at Pomfret, whe[n] they rode from London,
1884   Were iocund, and suppos'd their states were sure,
1885   And they indeed had no cause to mistrust:
1886   But yet you see, how soone the Day o're- cast.
1887   This sudden stab of Rancour I misdoubt:
1888   Pray God (I say) I proue a needlesse Coward.
1889   What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
1890   <S {Hast}.> Come, come, haue with you:
1891   Wot you what, my Lord,
1892   To day the Lords you talke of, are beheaded.
1893  *<S {Sta}.> They, for their truth, might better wear their Heads,
1894   Then some that haue accus'd them, weare their Hats.
1895   But come, my Lord, let's away.
1896   <D {Enter a Pursuiuant}.>
1897  *<S {Hast}.> Goe on before, Ile talke with this good fellow.
1898   <D {Exit Lord Stanley, and Catesby}.>
1899   How now, Sirrha? how goes the World with thee?
1900   <S {Purs}.> The better, that your Lordship please to aske.
1901   <S {Hast}.> I tell thee man, 'tis better with me now,
1902   Then when thou met'st me last, where now we meet:
1903   Then was I going Prisoner to the Tower,
1904   By the suggestion of the Queenes Allyes.
1905   But now I tell thee (keepe it to thy selfe)
1906   This day those Enemies are put to death,
1907   And I in better state then ere I was.
1908   <S {Purs}.> God hold it, to your Honors good content.
1909   <S {Hast}.> Gramercie fellow: there, drinke that for me.
1910   <D {Throwes him his Purse}.>
1911   <S {Purs}.> I thanke your Honor.  <D {Exit Pursuiuant}.>
1912   <D {Enter a Priest}.>
1913  *<S {Priest}.> Well met, my Lord, I am glad to see your Ho-nor.
1914  _
1915  *<S {Hast}.> I thanke thee, good Sir {Iohn}, with all my heart.
1916   I am in your debt, for your last Exercise:
1917   Come the next Sabboth, and I will content you.
1918   <S {Priest}.> Ile wait vpon your Lordship.
1919   <D {Enter Buckingham}.>
1920  *<S {Buc}.> What, talking with a Priest, Lord Chamberlaine?
1921   Your friends at Pomfret, they doe need the Priest,
1922   Your Honor hath no shriuing worke in hand.
1923   <S {Hast}.> Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
1924   The men you talke of, came into my minde.
1925   What, goe you toward the Tower?
1926   <S {Buc}.> I doe, my Lord, but long I cannot stay there:
1927   I shall returne before your Lordship, thence.
1928   <S {Hast}.> Nay like enough, for I stay Dinner there.
1929   <S {Buc}.> And Supper too, although thou know'st it not.
1930   Come, will you goe?
1931   <S {Hast}.> Ile wait vpon your Lordship.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1932   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
1933   <D {Enter Sir Richard Ratcliffe, with Halberds, carrying}
1934   {the Nobles to death at Pomfret}.>
1935   <S {Riuers}.> Sir {Richard Ratcliffe}, let me tell thee this,
1936   To day shalt thou behold a Subiect die,
1937   For Truth, for Dutie, and for Loyaltie.
1938  *<S {Grey}.> God blesse the Prince from all the Pack of you,
1939   A Knot you are, of damned Blood- suckers.
1940  *<S {Vaugh}.> You liue, that shall cry woe for this heere-after.
1941  _
1942   <S {Rat}.> Dispatch, the limit of your Liues is out.
1943  *<S {Riuers}.> O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody Prison!
1944   Fatall and ominous to Noble Peeres:
1945   Within the guiltie Closure of thy Walls,
1946   {#Richard} the Second here was hackt to death:
1947   And for more slander to thy dismall Seat,
1948   Wee giue to thee our guiltlesse blood to drinke.
1949   <S {Grey}.> Now {Margarets} Curse is falne vpon our Heads,
1950   When shee exclaim'd on {Hastings}, you, and I,
1951   For standing by, when {Richard} stab'd her Sonne.
1952   <S {Riuers}.> Then curs'd shee {Richard},
1953   Then curs'd shee {Buckingham},
1954   Then curs'd shee {Hastings}. Oh remember God,
1955   To heare her prayer for them, as now for vs:
1956   And for my Sister, and her Princely Sonnes,
1957   Be satisfy'd, deare God, with our true blood,
1958   Which, as thou know'st, vniustly must be spilt.
1959   <S {Rat}.> Make haste, the houre of death is expiate.
1960  *<S {Riuers}.> Come {Grey}, come {Vaughan}, let vs here embrace.
1961   Farewell, vntill we meet againe in Heauen.
1962   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P s1>
1963   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>
1964   <D {Enter Buckingham, Darby, Hastings, Bishop of Ely},
1965   {Norfolke, Ratcliffe, Louell, with others},
1966   {at a Table}.>
1967   <S {Hast}.> Now Noble Peeres, the cause why we are met,
1968   Is to determine of the Coronation:
1969   In Gods Name speake, when is the Royall day?
1970   <S {Buck}.> Is all things ready for the Royall time?
1971   <S {Darb}.> It is, and wants but nomination.
1972   <S {Ely}.> To morrow then I iudge a happie day.
1973  *<S {Buck}.> Who knowes the Lord Protectors mind herein?
1974   Who is most inward with the Noble Duke?
1975  *<S {Ely}.> Your Grace, we thinke, should soonest know his
1976   minde.
1977   <S {Buck}.> We know each others Faces: for our Hearts,
1978   He knowes no more of mine, then I of yours,
1979   Or I of his, my Lord, then you of mine:
1980   Lord {Hastings}, you and he are neere in loue.
1981   <S {Hast}.> I thanke his Grace, I know he loues me well:
1982   But for his purpose in the Coronation,
1983   I haue not sounded him, nor he deliuer'd
1984   His gracious pleasure any way therein:
1985   But you, my Honorable Lords, may name the time,
1986   And in the Dukes behalfe Ile giue my Voice,
1987   Which I presume hee'le take in gentle part.
1988   <D {Enter Gloucester}.>
1989   <S {Ely}.> In happie time, here comes the Duke himselfe.
1990  *<S {Rich}.> My Noble Lords, and Cousins all, good morrow:
1991   I haue beene long a sleeper: but I trust,
1992   My absence doth neglect no great designe,
1993   Which by my presence might haue beene concluded.
1994   <S {Buck}.> Had you not come vpon your Q my Lord,
1995   {William}, Lord {Hastings}, had pronounc'd your part;
1996   I meane your Voice, for Crowning of the King.
1997   <S {Rich}.> Then my Lord {Hastings}, no man might be bolder,
1998   His Lordship knowes me well, and loues me well.
1999   My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborne,
2000   I saw good Strawberries in your Garden there,
2001   I doe beseech you, send for some of them.
2002   <S {Ely}.> Mary and will, my Lord, with all my heart.
2003   <D {Exit Bishop}.>
2004   <S {Rich}.> Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
2005   {#Catesby} hath sounded {Hastings} in our businesse,
2006   And findes the testie Gentleman so hot,
2007   That he will lose his Head, ere giue consent
2008   His Masters Child, as worshipfully he tearmes it,
2009   Shall lose the Royaltie of Englands Throne.
2010  *<S {Buck}.> Withdraw your selfe #a while, Ile goe with you.
2011   <D {Exeunt}.>
2012  *<S {Darb}.> We haue not yet set downe this day of Triumph:
2013   To morrow, in my iudgement, is too sudden,
2014   For I my selfe am not so well prouided,
2015   As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
2016   <D {Enter the Bishop of Ely}.>
2017   <S {Ely}.> Where is my Lord, the Duke of Gloster?
2018   I haue sent for these Strawberries.
2019  *<S {Ha}.> His Grace looks chearfully & smooth this morning,
2020   There's some conceit or other likes him well,
2021   When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
2022   I thinke there's neuer a man in Christendome
2023   Can lesser hide his loue, or hate, then hee,
2024   For by his Face straight shall you know his Heart.
2025   <S {Darb}.> What of his Heart perceiue you in his Face,
2026   By any liuelyhood he shew'd to day?
2027   <S {Hast}.> Mary, that with no man here he is offended:
2028   For were he, he had shewne it in his Lookes.
2029   <D {Enter Richard, and Buckingham}.>
2030   <S {Rich}.> I pray you all, tell me what they deserue,
2031   That doe conspire my death with diuellish Plots
2032   Of damned Witchcraft, and that haue preuail'd
2033   Vpon my Body with their Hellish Charmes.
2034   <S {Hast}.> The tender loue I beare your Grace, my Lord,
2035   Makes me most forward, in this Princely presence,
2036   To doome th' Offendors, whosoe're they be:
2037   I say, my Lord, they haue deserued death.
2038   <S {Rich}.> Then be your eyes the witnesse of their euill.
2039   Looke how I am bewitch'd: behold, mine Arme
2040   Is like a blasted Sapling, wither'd vp:
2041   And this is {Edwards} Wife, that monstrous Witch,
2042   Consorted with that Harlot, Strumpet {Shore},
2043   That by their Witchcraft thus haue marked me.
2044   <S {Hast}.> #If they haue done this deed, my Noble Lord.
2045   <S {Rich}.> #If? thou Protector of this damned Strumpet,
2046   Talk'st thou to me of Ifs: thou art a Traytor,
2047   Off with his Head; now by Saint {Paul} I sweare,
2048   I will not dine, vntill I see the same.
2049   {#Louell} and {Ratcliffe}, looke that it be done:  <D {Exeunt}.>
2050   The rest that loue me, rise, and follow me.
2051   <D {Manet Louell and Ratcliffe, with the}
2052   {Lord Hastings}.>
2053   <S {Hast}.> Woe, woe for England, not a whit for me,
2054   For I, too fond, might haue preuented this:
2055   {#Stanley} did dreame, the Bore did rowse our Helmes,
2056   And I did scorne it, and disdaine to flye:
2057   Three times to day my Foot- Cloth- Horse did stumble,
2058   And started, when he look'd vpon the Tower,
2059   As loth to beare me to the slaughter- house.
2060   O now I need the Priest, that spake to me:
2061   I now repent I told the Pursuiuant,
2062   As too triumphing, how mine Enemies
2063   To day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
2064   And I my selfe secure, in grace and fauour.
2065   Oh {Margaret}, {Margaret}, now thy heauie Curse
2066   Is lighted on poore {Hastings} wretched Head.
2067  *<S {Ra}.> Come, come, dispatch, the Duke would be at dinner:
2068   Make a short Shrift, he longs to see your Head.
2069   <S {Hast}.> O momentarie grace of mortall men,
2070   Which we more hunt for, then the grace of God!
2071   Who builds his hope in ayre of your good Lookes,
2072   Liues like a drunken Sayler on a Mast,
2073   Readie with euery Nod to tumble downe,
2074   Into the fatall Bowels of the Deepe.
2075   <S {Lou}.> Come, come, dispatch, 'tis bootlesse to exclaime.
2076   <S {Hast}.> O bloody {Richard}: miserable England,
2077   I prophecie the fearefull'st time to thee,
2078   That euer wretched Age hath look'd vpon.
2079   Come, lead me to the Block, beare him my Head,
2080   They smile at me, who shortly shall be dead.
2081   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P s1v>
2082   <D {Enter Richard, and Buckingham, in rotten Armour},
2083   {maruellous ill- fauoured}.>
2084   <S {Richard}.> Come Cousin,
2085   Canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
2086   Murther thy breath in middle of a word,
2087   And then againe begin, and stop againe,
2088   As if thou were distraught, and mad with terror?
2089   <S {Buck}.> Tut, I can counterfeit the deepe Tragedian,
2090   Speake, and looke backe, and prie on euery side,
2091   Tremble and start at wagging of a Straw:
2092   Intending deepe suspition, gastly Lookes
2093   Are at my seruice, like enforced Smiles;
2094   And both are readie in their Offices,
2095   At any time to grace my Stratagemes.
2096   But what, is {Catesby} gone?
2097   <S {Rich}.> He is, and see he brings the Maior along.
2098   <D {Enter the Maior, and Catesby}.>
2099   <S {Buck}.> Lord Maior.
2100   <S {Rich}.> Looke to the Draw- Bridge there.
2101   <S {Buck}.> Hearke, a Drumme.
2102   <S {Rich}.> {Catesby}, o're- looke the Walls.
2103   <S {Buck}.> Lord Maior, the reason we haue sent.
2104   <S {Rich}.> Looke back, defend thee, here are Enemies.
2105  *<S {Buck}.> God and our Innocencie defend, and guard vs.
2106   <D {Enter Louell and Ratcliffe, with Hastings Head}.>
2107  *<S {Rich}.> Be patient, they are friends: {Ratcliffe}, and {Louell}.
2108   <S {Louell}.> Here is the Head of that ignoble Traytor,
2109   The dangerous and vnsuspected {Hastings}.
2110   <S {Rich}.> So deare I lou'd the man, that I must weepe:
2111   I tooke him for the plainest harmelesse Creature,
2112   That breath'd vpon the Earth, a Christian.
2113   Made him my Booke, wherein my Soule recorded
2114   The Historie of all her secret thoughts.
2115   So smooth he dawb'd his Vice with shew of Vertue,
2116   That his apparant open Guilt omitted,
2117   I meane, his Conuersation with {Shores} Wife,
2118   He liu'd from all attainder of suspects.
2119  *<S {Buck}.> Well, well, he was the couertst sheltred Traytor
2120   That euer liu'd.
2121   Would you imagine, or almost beleeue,
2122   #Wert not, that by great preseruation
2123   We liue to tell it, that the subtill Traytor
2124   This day had plotted, in the Councell- House,
2125   To murther me, and my good Lord of Gloster.
2126   <S {Maior}.> Had he done so?
2127   <S {Rich}.> What? thinke you we are Turkes, or Infidels?
2128   Or that we would, against the forme of Law,
2129   Proceed thus rashly in the Villaines death,
2130   But that the extreme perill of the case,
2131   The Peace of England, and our Persons safetie,
2132   Enforc'd vs to this Execution.
2133   <S {Maior}.> Now faire befall you, he deseru'd his death,
2134   And your good Graces both haue well proceeded,
2135   To warne false Traytors from the like Attempts.
2136   <S {Buck}.> I neuer look'd for better at his hands,
2137   After he once fell in with Mistresse {Shore}:
2138   Yet had we not determin'd he should dye,
2139   Vntill your Lordship came to see his end,
2140   Which now the louing haste of these our friends,
2141   Something against our meanings, haue preuented;
2142   Because, my Lord, I would haue had you heard
2143   The Traytor speake, and timorously confesse
2144   The manner and the purpose of his Treasons:
2145   That you might well haue signify'd the same
2146   Vnto the Citizens, who haply may
2147   Misconster vs in him, and wayle his death.
2148  *<S {Ma}.> But, my good Lord, your Graces words shal serue,
2149   As well as I had seene, and heard him speake:
2150   And doe not doubt, right Noble Princes both,
2151   But Ile acquaint our dutious Citizens
2152   With all your iust proceedings in this case.
2153  *<S {Rich}.> And to that end we wish'd your Lordship here,
2154   T' auoid the Censures of the carping World.
2155   <S {Buck}.> Which since you come too late of our intent,
2156   Yet witnesse what you heare we did intend:
2157   And so, my good Lord Maior, we bid farwell.
2158   <D {Exit Maior}.>
2159   <S {Rich}.> Goe after, after, Cousin {Buckingham}.
2160   The Maior towards Guild- Hall hyes him in all poste:
2161   There, at your meetest vantage of the time,
2162   Inferre the Bastardie of {Edwards} Children:
2163   Tell them, how {Edward} put to death a Citizen,
2164   Onely for saying, he would make his Sonne
2165   Heire to the Crowne, meaning indeed his House,
2166   Which, by the Signe thereof, was tearmed so.
2167   Moreouer, vrge his hatefull Luxurie,
2168   And beastiall appetite in change of Lust,
2169   Which stretcht vnto their Seruants, Daughters, Wiues,
2170   Euen where his raging eye, or sauage heart,
2171   Without controll, lusted to make a prey.
2172   Nay, for a need, thus farre come neere my Person:
2173   Tell them, when that my Mother went with Child
2174   Of that insatiate {Edward}; Noble {Yorke},
2175   My Princely Father, then had Warres in France,
2176   And by true computation of the time,
2177   Found, that the Issue was not his begot:
2178   Which well appeared in his Lineaments,
2179   Being nothing like the Noble Duke, my Father:
2180   Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere farre off,
2181   Because, my Lord, you know my Mother liues.
2182   <S {Buck}.> Doubt not, my Lord, Ile play the Orator,
2183   As if the Golden Fee, for which I plead,
2184   Were for my selfe: and so, my Lord, adue.
2185  *<S {Rich}.> If you thriue wel, bring them to Baynards Castle,
2186   Where you shall finde me well accompanied
2187   With reuerend Fathers, and well- learned Bishops.
2188   <S {Buck}.> I goe, and towards three or foure #a Clocke
2189   Looke for the Newes that the Guild- Hall affoords.
2190   <D {Exit Buckingham}.>
2191   <S {Rich}.> Goe {Louell} with all speed to Doctor {Shaw},
2192   Goe thou to Fryer {Penker}, bid them both
2193   Meet me within this houre at Baynards Castle.  <D {Exit}.>
2194   Now will I goe to take some priuie order,
2195   To draw the Brats of {Clarence} out of sight,
2196   And to giue order, that no manner person
2197   Haue any time recourse vnto the Princes.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2198   <D {Enter a Scriuener}.>
2199  *<S {Scr}.> Here is the Indictment of the good Lord {Hastings},
2200   Which in a set Hand fairely is engross'd,
2201   That it may be to day read o're in {Paules}.
2202   And marke how well the sequell hangs together:
2203   Eleuen houres I haue spent to write it ouer,
2204   For yester- night by {Catesby} was it sent me,
2205   The Precedent was full as long #a doing,
2206   And yet within these fiue houres {Hastings} liu'd,
2207   Vntainted, vnexamin'd, free, at libertie.
2208   Here's a good World the while.
2209   Who is so grosse, that cannot see this palpable deuice?
      <P s2>
2210   Yet who so bold, but sayes he sees it not?
2211   Bad is the World, and all will come to nought,
2212   When such #ill dealing must be seene in thought.  <D {Exit}.>
2213   <D {Enter Richard and Buckingham at seuerall Doores}.>
2214   <S {Rich}.> How now, how now, what say the Citizens?
2215   <S {Buck}.> Now by the holy Mother of our Lord,
2216   The Citizens are mum, say not a word.
2217  *<S {Rich}.> Toucht you the Bastardie of {Edwards} Children?
2218   <S {Buck}.> I did, with his Contract with Lady {Lucy},
2219   And his Contract by Deputie in France,
2220   Th' vnsatiate greedinesse of his desire,
2221   And his enforcement of the Citie Wiues,
2222   His Tyrannie for Trifles, his owne Bastardie,
2223   As being got, your Father then in France,
2224   And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
2225   Withall, I did inferre your Lineaments,
2226   Being the right {Idea} of your Father,
2227   Both in your forme, and Noblenesse of Minde:
2228   Layd open all your Victories in Scotland,
2229   Your Discipline in Warre, Wisdome in Peace,
2230   Your Bountie, Vertue, faire Humilitie:
2231   Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose,
2232   Vntoucht, or sleightly handled in discourse.
2233   And when my Oratorie drew toward end,
2234   I bid them that did loue their Countries good,
2235   Cry, God saue {Richard}, Englands Royall King.
2236   <S {Rich}.> And did they so?
2237   <S {Buck}.> No, so God helpe me, they spake not a word,
2238   But like dumbe Statues, or breathing Stones,
2239   Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale:
2240   Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
2241   And ask'd the Maior, what meant this wilfull silence?
2242   His answer was, the people were not vsed
2243   To be spoke to, but by the Recorder.
2244   Then he was vrg'd to tell my Tale againe:
2245   Thus sayth the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd,
2246   But nothing spoke, in warrant from himselfe.
2247   When he had done, some followers of mine owne,
2248   At lower end of the Hall, hurld vp their Caps,
2249   And some tenne voyces cry'd, God saue King {Richard}:
2250   And thus I tooke the vantage of those few.
2251   Thankes gentle Citizens, and friends, quoth I,
2252   This generall applause, and chearefull showt,
2253   Argues your wisdome, and your loue to {Richard}:
2254   And euen here brake off, and came away.
2255   <S {Rich}.> What tongue- lesse Blockes were they,
2256   Would they not speake?
2257   Will not the Maior then, and his Brethren, come?
2258   <S {Buck}.> The Maior is here at hand: intend some feare,
2259   Be not you spoke with, but by mightie suit:
2260   And looke you get a Prayer- Booke in your hand,
2261   And stand betweene two Church- men, good my Lord,
2262   For on that ground Ile make a holy Descant:
2263   And be not easily wonne to our requests,
2264   Play the Maids part, still answer nay, and take it.
2265   <S {Rich}.> I goe: and if you plead as well for them,
2266   As I can say nay to thee for my selfe,
2267   No doubt we bring it to a happie issue.
2268  *<S {Buck}.> Go, go vp to the Leads, the Lord Maior knocks.
2269   <D {Enter the Maior, and Citizens}.>
2270   Welcome, my Lord, I dance attendance here,
2271   I thinke the Duke will not be spoke withall.
2272   <D {Enter Catesby}.>
2273  *<S {Buck}.> Now {Catesby}, what sayes your Lord to my
2274   request?
2275  *<S {Catesby}.> He doth entreat your Grace, my Noble Lord,
2276   To visit him to morrow, or next day:
2277   He is within, with two right reuerend Fathers,
2278   Diuinely bent to Meditation,
2279   And in no Worldly suites would he be mou'd,
2280   To draw him from his holy Exercise.
2281   <S {Buck}.> Returne, good {Catesby}, to the gracious Duke,
2282   Tell him, my selfe, the Maior and Aldermen,
2283   In deepe designes, in matter of great moment,
2284   No lesse importing then our generall good,
2285   Are come to haue some conference with his Grace.
2286   <S {Catesby}.> Ile signifie so much vnto him straight.  <D {Exit}.>
2287   <S {Buck}.> Ah ha, my Lord, this Prince is not an {Edward},
2288   He is not lulling on a lewd Loue- Bed,
2289   But on his Knees, at Meditation:
2290   Not dallying with a Brace of Curtizans,
2291   But meditating with two deepe Diuines:
2292   Not sleeping, to engrosse his idle Body,
2293   But praying, to enrich his watchfull Soule.
2294   Happie were England, would this vertuous Prince
2295   Take on his Grace the Soueraigntie thereof.
2296   But sure I feare we shall not winne him to it.
2297  *<S {Maior}.> Marry God defend his Grace should say vs
2298   nay.
2299   <S {Buck}.> I feare he will: here {Catesby} comes againe.
2300   <D {Enter Catesby}.>
2301   Now {Catesby}, what sayes his Grace?
2302  *<S {Catesby}.> He wonders to what end you haue assembled
2303   Such troopes of Citizens, to come to him,
2304   His Grace not being warn'd thereof before:
2305   He feares, my Lord, you meane no good to him.
2306   <S {Buck}.> Sorry I am, my Noble Cousin should
2307   Suspect me, that I meane no good to him:
2308   By Heauen, we come to him in perfit loue,
2309   And so once more returne, and tell his Grace.  <D {Exit}.>
2310   When holy and deuout Religious men
2311   Are at their Beades, 'tis much to draw them thence,
2312   So sweet is zealous Contemplation.
2313   <D {Enter Richard aloft, betweene two Bishops}.>
2314  *<S {Maior}.> See where his Grace stands, tweene two Clergie
2315   men.
2316   <S {Buck}.> Two Props of Vertue, for a Christian Prince,
2317   To stay him from the fall of Vanitie:
2318   And see a Booke of Prayer in his hand,
2319   True Ornaments to know a holy man.
2320   Famous {Plantagenet}, most gracious Prince,
2321   Lend fauourable eare to our requests,
2322   And pardon vs the interruption
2323   Of thy Deuotion, and right Christian Zeale.
2324   <S {Rich}.> My Lord, there needes no such Apologie:
2325   I doe beseech your Grace to pardon me,
2326   Who earnest in the seruice of my God,
2327   Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
2328   But leauing this, what is your Graces pleasure?
2329   <S {Buck}.> Euen that (I hope) which pleaseth God aboue,
2330   And all good men, of this vngouern'd #Ile.
2331   <S {Rich}.> I doe suspect I haue done some offence,
2332   That seemes disgracious in the Cities eye,
2333   And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
      <P s2v>
2334   <S {Buck}.> You haue, my Lord:
2335   Would it might please your Grace,
2336   On our entreaties, to amend your fault.
2337   <S {Rich}.> Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian Land.
2338   <S {Buck}.> Know then, it is your fault, that you resigne
2339   The Supreme Seat, the Throne Maiesticall,
2340   The Sceptred Office of your Ancestors,
2341   Your State of Fortune, and your Deaw of Birth,
2342   The Lineall Glory of your Royall House,
2343   To the corruption of a blemisht Stock;
2344   Whiles in the mildnesse of your sleepie thoughts,
2345   Which here we waken to our Countries good,
2346   The Noble #Ile doth want his proper Limmes:
2347   His Face defac'd with skarres of Infamie,
2348   His Royall Stock grafft with ignoble Plants,
2349   And almost shouldred in the swallowing Gulfe
2350   Of darke Forgetfulnesse, and deepe Obliuion.
2351   Which to recure, we heartily solicite
2352   Your gracious selfe to take on you the charge
2353   And Kingly Gouernment of this your Land:
2354   Not as Protector, Steward, Substitute,
2355   Or lowly Factor, for anothers gaine;
2356   But as successiuely, from Blood to Blood,
2357   Your Right of Birth, your Empyrie, your owne.
2358   For this, consorted with the Citizens,
2359   Your very Worshipfull and louing friends,
2360   And by their vehement instigation,
2361   In this iust Cause come I to moue your Grace.
2362   <S {Rich}.> I cannot tell, if to depart in silence,
2363   Or bitterly to speake in your reproofe,
2364   Best fitteth my Degree, or your Condition.
2365   If not to answer, you might haply thinke,
2366   Tongue- ty'd Ambition, not replying, yeelded
2367   To beare the Golden Yoake of Soueraigntie,
2368   Which fondly you would here impose on me.
2369   If to reproue you for this suit of yours,
2370   So season'd with your faithfull loue to me,
2371   Then on the other side I check'd my friends.
2372   Therefore to speake, and to auoid the first,
2373   And then in speaking, not to incurre the last,
2374   Definitiuely thus I answer you.
2375   Your loue deserues my thankes, but my desert
2376   Vnmeritable, shunnes your high request.
2377   First, if all Obstacles were cut away,
2378   And that my Path were euen to the Crowne,
2379   As the ripe Reuenue, and due of Birth:
2380   Yet so much is my pouertie of spirit,
2381   So mightie, and so manie my defects,
2382   That I would rather hide me from my Greatnesse,
2383   Being a Barke to brooke no mightie Sea;
2384   Then in my Greatnesse couet to be hid,
2385   And in the vapour of my Glory smother'd.
2386   But God be thank'd, there is no need of me,
2387   And much I need to helpe you, were there need:
2388   The Royall Tree hath left vs Royall Fruit,
2389   Which mellow'd by the stealing howres of time,
2390   Will well become the Seat of Maiestie,
2391   And make (no doubt) vs happy by his Reigne.
2392   On him I lay that, you would lay on me,
2393   The Right and Fortune of his happie Starres,
2394   Which God defend that I should wring from him.
2395  *<S {Buck}.> My Lord, this argues Conscience in your Grace,
2396   But the respects thereof are nice, and triuiall,
2397   All circumstances well considered.
2398   You say, that {Edward} is your Brothers Sonne,
2399   So say we too, but not by {Edwards} Wife:
2400   For first was he contract to Lady {Lucie},
2401   Your Mother liues a Witnesse to his Vow;
2402   And afterward by substitute betroth'd
2403   To {Bona}, Sister to the King of France.
2404   These both put off, a poore Petitioner,
2405   A Care- cras'd Mother to a many Sonnes,
2406   A Beautie- waining, and distressed Widow,
2407   Euen in the after- noone of her best dayes,
2408   Made prize and purchase of his wanton Eye,
2409   Seduc'd the pitch, and height of his degree,
2410   To base declension, and loath'd Bigamie.
2411   By her, in his vnlawfull Bed, he got
2412   This {Edward}, whom our Manners call the Prince.
2413   More bitterly could I expostulate,
2414   Saue that for reuerence to some aliue,
2415   I giue a sparing limit to my Tongue.
2416   Then good, my Lord, take to your Royall selfe
2417   This proffer'd benefit of Dignitie:
2418   If not to blesse vs and the Land withall,
2419   Yet to draw forth your Noble Ancestrie
2420   From the corruption of abusing times,
2421   Vnto a Lineall true deriued course.
2422  *<S {Maior}.> Do good my Lord, your Citizens entreat you.
2423   <S {Buck}.> Refuse not, mightie Lord, this proffer'd loue.
2424  *<S {Catesb}.> O make them ioyfull, grant their lawfull suit.
2425   <S {Rich}.> Alas, why would you heape this Care on me?
2426   I am vnfit for State, and Maiestie:
2427   I doe beseech you take it not amisse,
2428   I cannot, nor I will not yeeld to you.
2429   <S {Buck}.> If you refuse it, as in loue and zeale,
2430   Loth to depose the Child, your Brothers Sonne,
2431   As well we know your tendernesse of heart,
2432   And gentle, kinde, effeminate remorse,
2433   Which we haue noted in you to your Kindred,
2434   And egally indeede to all Estates:
2435   Yet know, #where you accept our suit, or no,
2436   Your Brothers Sonne shall neuer reigne our King,
2437   But we will plant some other in the Throne,
2438   To the disgrace and downe- fall of your House:
2439   And in this resolution here we leaue you.
2440   Come Citizens, we will entreat no more.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2441  *<S {Catesb}.> Call him againe, sweet Prince, accept their suit:
2442   If you denie them, all the Land will rue it.
2443   <S {Rich}.> Will you enforce me to a world of Cares.
2444   Call them againe, I am not made of Stones,
2445   But penetrable to your kinde entreaties,
2446   Albeit against my Conscience and my Soule.
2447   <D {Enter Buckingham, and the rest}.>
2448   Cousin of Buckingham, and sage graue men,
2449   Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
2450   To beare her burthen, #where I will or no.
2451   I must haue patience to endure the Load:
2452   But if black Scandall, or foule- fac'd Reproach,
2453   Attend the sequell of your Imposition,
2454   Your meere enforcement shall acquittance me
2455   From all the impure blots and staynes thereof;
2456   For God doth know, and you may partly see,
2457   How farre I am from the desire of this.
2458  *<S {Maior}.> God blesse your Grace, wee see it, and will
2459   say it.
2460   <S {Rich}.> In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
2461   <S {Buck}.> Then I salute you with this Royall Title,
2462   Long liue King {Richard}, Englands worthie King.
2463   <S {All}.> Amen.
2464   <S {Buck}.> To morrow may it please you to be Crown'd.
2465   <S {Rich}.> Euen when you please, for you will haue it so.
      <P s3>
2466   <S {Buck}.> To morrow then we will attend your Grace,
2467   And so most ioyfully we take our leaue.
2468   <S {Rich}.> Come, let vs to our holy Worke againe.
2469   Farewell my Cousins, farewell gentle friends.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2470   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
2471   <D {Enter the Queene, Anne Duchesse of Gloucester, the}
2472   {Duchesse of Yorke, and Marquesse Dorset}.>
2473   <S {Duch.Yorke}.> Who meetes vs heere?
2474   My Neece {Plantagenet},
2475   Led in the hand of her kind Aunt of Gloster?
2476   Now, for my Life, shee's wandring to the Tower,
2477   On pure hearts loue, to greet the tender Prince.
2478   Daughter, well met.
2479   <S {Anne}.> God giue your Graces both, a happie
2480   And a ioyfull time of day.
2481   <S {Qu}.> As much to you, good Sister: whither away?
2482   <S {Anne}.> No farther then the Tower, and as I guesse,
2483   Vpon the like deuotion as your selues,
2484   To gratulate the gentle Princes there.
2485   <S {Qu}.> Kind Sister thankes, wee'le enter all together:
2486   <D {Enter the Lieutenant}.>
2487   And in good time, here the Lieutenant comes.
2488   Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leaue,
2489   How doth the Prince, and my young Sonne of {Yorke}?
2490   <S {Lieu}.> Right well, deare Madame: by your patience,
2491   I may not suffer you to visit them,
2492   The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
2493   <S {Qu}.> The King? who's that?
2494   <S {Lieu}.> I meane, the Lord Protector.
2495   <S {Qu}.> The Lord protect him from that Kingly Title.
2496   Hath he set bounds betweene their loue, and me?
2497   I am their Mother, who shall barre me from them?
2498  *<S {Duch.Yorke}.> I am their Fathers Mother, I will see
2499   them.
2500   <S {Anne}.> Their Aunt I am in law, in loue their Mother:
2501   Then bring me to their sights, Ile beare thy blame,
2502   And take thy Office from thee, on my perill.
2503   <S {Lieu}.> No, Madame, no; I may not leaue it so:
2504   I am bound by Oath, and therefore pardon me.
2505   <D {Exit Lieutenant}.>
2506   <D {Enter Stanley}.>
2507  *<S {Stanley}.> Let me but meet you Ladies one howre hence,
2508   And Ile salute your Grace of Yorke as Mother,
2509   And reuerend looker on of two faire Queenes.
2510   Come Madame, you must straight to Westminster,
2511   There to be crowned {Richards} Royall Queene.
2512   <S {Qu}.> Ah, cut my Lace asunder,
2513   That my pent heart may haue some scope to beat,
2514   Or else I swoone with this dead- killing newes.
2515   <S {Anne}.> Despightfull tidings, O vnpleasing newes.
2516  *<S {Dors}.> Be of good cheare: Mother, how fares your
2517   Grace?
2518   <S {Qu}.> O {Dorset}, speake not to me, get thee gone,
2519   Death and Destruction dogges thee at thy heeles,
2520   Thy Mothers Name is ominous to Children.
2521   If thou wilt out- strip Death, goe crosse the Seas,
2522   And liue with {Richmond}, from the reach of #Hell.
2523   Goe hye thee, hye thee from this slaughter- house,
2524   Lest thou encrease the number of the dead,
2525   And make me dye the thrall of {Margarets} Curse,
2526   Nor Mother, Wife, nor Englands counted Queene.
2527  *<S {Stanley}.> Full of wise care, is this your counsaile, Madame:
2528   Take all the swift aduantage of the howres:
2529   You shall haue Letters from me to my Sonne,
2530   In your behalfe, to meet you on the way:
2531   Be not ta'ne tardie by vnwise delay.
2532   <S {Duch.Yorke}.> O #ill dispersing Winde of Miserie.
2533   O my accursed Wombe, the Bed of Death:
2534   A Cockatrice hast thou hatcht to the World,
2535   Whose vnauoided Eye is murtherous.
2536  *<S {Stanley}.> Come, Madame, come, I in all haste was sent.
2537   <S {Anne}.> And I with all vnwillingnesse will goe.
2538   O would to God, that the inclusiue Verge
2539   Of Golden Mettall, that must round my Brow,
2540   Were red hot Steele, to seare me to the Braines,
2541   Anoynted let me be with deadly Venome,
2542   And dye ere men can say, God saue the Queene.
2543   <S {Qu}.> Goe, goe, poore soule, I enuie not thy glory,
2544   To feed my humor, wish thy selfe no harme.
2545  *<S {Anne}.> No: why? When he that is my Husband now,
2546   Came to me, as I follow'd {Henries} Corse,
2547   When scarce the blood was well washt from his hands,
2548   Which issued from my other Angell Husband,
2549   And that deare Saint, which then I weeping follow'd:
2550   O, when I say I look'd on {Richards} Face,
2551   This was my Wish: Be thou (quoth I) accurst,
2552   For making me, so young, so old a Widow:
2553   And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy Bed;
2554   And be thy Wife, if any be so mad,
2555   More miserable, by the Life of thee,
2556   Then thou hast made me, by my deare Lords death.
2557   Loe, ere I can repeat this Curse againe,
2558   Within so small a time, my Womans heart
2559   Grossely grew captiue to his honey words,
2560   And prou'd the subiect of mine owne Soules Curse,
2561   Which hitherto hath held mine eyes from rest:
2562   For neuer yet one howre in his Bed
2563   Did I enioy the golden deaw of sleepe,
2564   But with his timorous Dreames was still awak'd.
2565   Besides, he hates me for my Father {Warwicke},
2566   And will (no doubt) shortly be rid of me.
2567   <S {Qu}.> Poore heart adieu, I pittie thy complaining.
2568  *<S {Anne}.> No more, then with my soule I mourne for
2569   yours.
2570   <S {Dors}.> Farewell, thou wofull welcommer of glory.
2571  *<S {Anne}.> Adieu, poore soule, that tak'st thy leaue
2572   of it.
2573  *<S {Du.Y}.> Go thou to {Richmond}, & good fortune guide thee,
2574   Go thou to {Richard}, and good Angels tend thee,
2575  *Go thou to Sanctuarie, and good thoughts possesse thee,
2576   I to my Graue, where peace and rest lye with mee.
2577   Eightie odde yeeres of sorrow haue I seene,
2578   And each howres ioy wrackt with a weeke of teene.
2579   <S {Qu}.> Stay, yet looke backe with me vnto the Tower.
2580   Pitty, you ancient Stones, those tender Babes,
2581   Whom Enuie hath immur'd within your Walls,
2582   Rough Cradle for such little prettie ones,
2583   Rude ragged Nurse, old sullen Play- fellow,
2584   For tender Princes: vse my Babies well;
2585   So foolish Sorrowes bids your Stones farewell.
2586   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P s3v>
2587   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2588   <D {Sound a Sennet. Enter Richard in pompe, Buc-kingham,
2589   Catesby, Ratcliffe, Louel}.>
2590   <S {Rich}.> Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham.
2591   <S {Buck}.> My gracious Soueraigne.
2592   <S {Rich}.> Giue me thy hand.  <D {Sound}.>
2593   Thus high, by thy aduice, and thy assistance,
2594   Is King {Richard} seated:
2595   But shall we weare these Glories for a day?
2596   Or shall they last, and we reioyce in them?
2597   <S {Buck}.> Still liue they, and for euer let them last.
2598   <S {Rich}.> Ah {Buckingham}, now doe I play the Touch,
2599   To trie if thou be currant Gold indeed:
2600   Young {Edward} liues, thinke now what I would speake.
2601   <S {Buck}.> Say on my louing Lord.
2602   <S {Rich}.> Why {Buckingham}, I say I would be King.
2603   <S {Buck}.> Why so you are, my thrice- renowned Lord.
2604   <S {Rich}.> Ha? am I King? 'tis so: but {Edward} liues.
2605   <S {Buck}> True, Noble Prince.
2606   <S {Rich}.> O bitter consequence!
2607   That {Edward} still should liue true Noble Prince.
2608   Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
2609   Shall I be plaine? I wish the Bastards dead,
2610   And I would haue it suddenly perform'd.
2611   What say'st thou now? speake suddenly, be briefe.
2612   <S {Buck}.> Your Grace may doe your pleasure.
2613   <S {Rich}.> Tut, tut, thou art all Ice, thy kindnesse freezes:
2614   Say, haue I thy consent, that they shall dye?
2615  *<S {Buc}.> Giue me some litle breath, some pawse, deare Lord,
2616   Before I positiuely speake in this:
2617   I will resolue you herein presently.  <D {Exit Buck[ingham]}.>
2618   <S {Catesby}.> The King is angry, see he gnawes his Lippe.
2619   <S {Rich}.> I will conuerse with Iron- witted Fooles,
2620   And vnrespectiue Boyes: none are for me,
2621   That looke into me with considerate eyes,
2622   High- reaching {Buckingham} growes circumspect.
2623   Boy.
2624   <S {Page}.> My Lord.
2625   <S {Rich}.> Know'st thou not any, whom corrupting Gold
2626   Will tempt vnto a close exploit of Death?
2627   <S {Page}.> I know a discontented Gentleman,
2628   Whose humble meanes match not his haughtie spirit:
2629   Gold were as good as twentie Orators,
2630   And will (no doubt) tempt him to any thing.
2631   <S {Rich}.> What is his Name?
2632   <S {Page}.> His Name, my Lord, is {Tirrell}.
2633  *<S {Rich}.> I partly know the man: goe call him hither,
2634   Boy.  <D {Exit}.>
2635   The deepe reuoluing wittie {Buckingham},
2636   No more shall be the neighbor to my counsailes.
2637   Hath he so long held out with me, vntyr'd,
2638   And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
2639   <D {Enter Stanley}.>
2640   How now, Lord {Stanley}, what's the newes?
2641   <S {Stanley}.> Know my louing Lord, the Marquesse {Dorset}
2642   As I heare, is fled to {Richmond},
2643   In the parts where he abides.
2644   <S {Rich}.> Come hither {Catesby}, rumor it abroad,
2645   That {Anne} my Wife is very grieuous sicke,
2646   I will take order for her keeping close.
2647   Inquire me out some meane poore Gentleman,
2648   Whom I will marry straight to {Clarence} Daughter:
2649   The Boy is foolish, and I feare not him.
2650   Looke how thou dream'st: I say againe, giue out,
2651   That {Anne}, my Queene, is sicke, and like to dye.
2652   About it, for it stands me much vpon
2653   To stop all hopes, whose growth may dammage me.
2654   I must be marryed to my Brothers Daughter,
2655   Or else my Kingdome stands on brittle Glasse:
2656   Murther her Brothers, and then marry her,
2657   Vncertaine way of gaine. But I am in
2658   So farre in blood, that sinne will pluck on sinne,
2659   Teare- falling Pittie dwells not in this Eye.
2660   <D {Enter Tyrrel}.>
2661   Is thy Name {Tyrrel}?
2662   <S {Tyr}.> {Iames Tyrrel}, and your most obedient subiect.
2663   <S {Rich}.> Art thou indeed?
2664   <S {Tyr}.> Proue me, my gracious Lord.
2665   <S {Rich}.> Dar'st thou resolue to kill a friend of mine?
2666   <S {Tyr}.> Please you:
2667   But I had rather kill two enemies.
2668   <S {Rich}.> Why then thou hast it: two deepe enemies,
2669   Foes to my Rest, and my sweet sleepes disturbers,
2670   Are they that I would haue thee deale vpon:
2671   {Tyrrel}, I meane those Bastards in the Tower.
2672   <S {Tyr}.> Let me haue open meanes to come to them,
2673   And soone Ile rid you from the feare of them.
2674   <S {Rich}.> Thou sing'st sweet Musique:
2675   Hearke, come hither {Tyrrel},
2676   Goe by this token: rise, and lend thine Eare,  <D {Whispers}.>
2677   There is no more but so: say it is done,
2678   And I will loue thee, and preferre thee for it.
2679   <S {Tyr}.> I will dispatch it straight.  <D {Exit}.>
2680   <D {Enter Buckingham}.>
2681   <S {Buck}.> My Lord, I haue consider'd in my minde,
2682   The late request that you did sound me in.
2683   <S {Rich}.> Well, let that rest: {Dorset} is fled to {Richmond}.
2684   <S {Buck}.> I heare the newes, my Lord.
2685  *<S {Rich}.> {Stanley}, hee is your Wiues Sonne: well, looke
2686   vnto it.
2687  *<S {Buck}.> My Lord, I clayme the gift, my due by promise,
2688   For which your Honor and your Faith is pawn'd,
2689   Th' Earledome of Hertford, and the moueables,
2690   Which you haue promised I shall possesse.
2691   <S {Rich}.> {Stanley} looke to your Wife: if she conuey
2692   Letters to {Richmond}, you shall answer it.
2693   <S {Buck}.> What sayes your Highnesse to my iust request?
2694   <S {Rich}.> I doe remember me, {Henry} the Sixt
2695   Did prophecie, that {Richmond} should be King,
2696   When {Richmond} was a little peeuish Boy.
2697   A King perhaps.
2698   <S {Buck}.> May it please you to resolue me in my suit.
2699   <S {Rich}.> Thou troublest me, I am not in the vaine.  <D {Exit}.>
2700   <S {Buck}.> And is it thus? repayes he my deepe seruice
2701   With such contempt? made I him King for this?
2702   O let me thinke on {Hastings}, and be gone
2703   To Brecnock, while my fearefull Head is on.  <D {Exit}.>
2704   <D {Enter Tyrrel}.>
2705   <S {Tyr}.> The tyrannous and bloodie Act is done,
2706   The most arch deed of pittious massacre
      <P s4><C B>
2707   That euer yet this Land was guilty of:
2708   {Dighton} and {Forrest}, who I did suborne
2709   To do this peece of ruthfull Butchery,
2710   Albeit they were flesht Villaines, bloody Dogges,
2711   Melted with tendernesse, and milde compassion,
2712   Wept like #to Children, in their deaths sad Story.
2713   O thus (quoth {Dighton}) lay the gentle Babes:
2714   Thus, thus (quoth {Forrest}) girdling one another
2715   Within their Alablaster innocent Armes:
2716   Their lips were foure red Roses on a stalke,
2717   And in their Summer Beauty kist each other.
2718   A Booke of Prayers on their pillow lay,
2719   Which one (quoth {Forrest}) almost chang'd my minde:
2720   But oh the Diuell, there the Villaine stopt:
2721   When {Dighton} thus told on, we smothered
2722   The most replenished sweet worke of Nature,
2723   That from the prime Creation ere she framed.
2724   Hence both are gone with Conscience and Remorse,
2725   They could not speake, and so I left them both,
2726   To beare this tydings to the bloody King.
2727   <D {Enter Richard}.>
2728   And heere he comes. All health my Soueraigne Lord.
2729   <S {Ric}.> Kinde {Tirrell}, am I happy in thy Newes.
2730   <S {Tir}.> If to haue done the thing you gaue in charge,
2731   Beget your happinesse, be happy then,
2732   For it is done.
2733   <S {Rich}.> But did'st thou see them dead.
2734   <S {Tir}.> I did my Lord.
2735   <S {Rich}.> And buried gentle {Tirrell}.
2736   <S {Tir}.> The Chaplaine of the Tower hath buried them,
2737   But where (to say the truth) I do not know.
2738   <S {Rich}.> Come to me {Tirrel} soone, and after Supper,
2739   When thou shalt tell the processe of their death.
2740   Meane time, but thinke how I may do #the good,
2741   And be inheritor of thy desire.
2742   Farewell till then.
2743   <S {Tir}.> I humbly take my leaue.
2744   <S {Rich}.> The Sonne of {Clarence} haue I pent vp close,
2745   His daughter meanly haue I matcht in marriage,
2746   The Sonnes of {Edward} sleepe in {Abrahams} bosome,
2747   And {Anne} my wife hath bid this world good night.
2748   Now for I know the Britaine {Richmond} aymes
2749   At yong {Elizabeth} my brothers daughter,
2750   And by that knot lookes proudly on the Crowne,
2751   To her go I, a iolly thriuing wooer.
2752   <D {Enter Ratcliffe}.>
2753   <S {Rat}.> My Lord.
2754   <S {Rich}.> Good or bad newes, that thou com'st in so
2755   bluntly?
2756  *<S {Rat}.> Bad news my Lord, {Mourton} is fled to Richmond,
2757   And Buckingham backt with the hardy Welshmen
2758   Is in the field, and still his power encreaseth.
2759   <S {Rich}.> Ely with Richmond troubles me more neere,
2760   Then Buckingham and his rash leuied Strength.
2761   Come, I haue learn'd, that fearfull commenting
2762   Is leaden seruitor to dull delay.
2763   Delay leds impotent and Snaile- pac'd Beggery:
2764   Then fierie expedition be my wing,
2765   Ioues Mercury, and Herald for a King:
2766   Go muster men: My counsaile is my Sheeld,
2767   We must be breefe, when Traitors braue the Field.
2768   <D {Exeunt}.>
2769   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2770   <D {Enter old Queene Margaret}.>
2771   <S {Mar}.> So now prosperity begins to mellow,
2772   And drop into the rotten mouth of death:
2773   Heere in these Confines slily haue I lurkt,
2774   To watch the waining of mine enemies.
2775   A dire induction, am I witnesse to,
2776   And will to France, hoping the consequence
2777   Will proue as bitter, blacke, and Tragicall.
2778   Withdraw thee wretched {Margaret}, who comes heere?
2779   <D {Enter Dutchesse and Queene}.>
2780   <S {Qu}.> Ah my poore Princes! ah my tender Babes:
2781   My vnblowed Flowres, new appearing sweets:
2782   If yet your gentle soules flye in the Ayre,
2783   And be not fixt in doome perpetuall,
2784   Houer about me with your ayery wings,
2785   And heare your mothers Lamentation.
2786   <S {Mar}.> Houer about her, say that right for right
2787   Hath dim'd your Infant morne, to Aged night.
2788   <S {Dut}.> So many miseries haue craz'd my voyce,
2789   That my woe- wearied tongue is still and mute.
2790   {Edward Plantagenet}, why art thou dead?
2791   <S {Mar}.> {Plantagenet} doth quit {Plantagenet},
2792   {Edward} for {Edward}, payes a dying debt.
2793  *<S {Qu}.> Wilt thou, O God, flye from such gentle Lambs,
2794   And throw them in the intrailes of the Wolfe?
2795   When didst thou sleepe, when such a deed was done?
2796   <S {Mar}.> When holy {Harry} dyed, and my sweet Sonne.
2797  *<S {Dut}.> Dead life, blind sight, poore mortall liuing ghost,
2798   Woes Scene, Worlds shame, Graues due, by life vsurpt,
2799   Breefe abstract and record of tedious dayes,
2800   Rest thy vnrest on Englands lawfull earth,
2801   Vnlawfully made drunke with innocent blood.
2802   <S {Qu}.> Ah that thou would'st assoone affoord a Graue,
2803   As thou canst yeeld a melancholly seate:
2804   Then would I hide my bones, not rest them heere,
2805   Ah who hath any cause to mourne but wee?
2806   <S {Mar}.> If ancient sorrow be most reuerent,
2807   Giue mine the benefit of signeurie,
2808   And let my greefes frowne on the vpper hand
2809   If sorrow can admit Society.
2810   I had an {Edward}, till a {Richard} kill'd him:
2811   I had a Husband, till a {Richard} kill'd him:
2812   Thou had'st an {Edward}, till a {Richard} kill'd him:
2813   Thou had'st a {Richard}, till a {Richard} kill'd him.
2814   <S {Dut}.> I had a {Richard} too, and thou did'st kill him;
2815   I had a {Rutland} too, thou hop'st to kill him.
2816   <S {Mar}.> Thou had'st a {Clarence} too,
2817   And {Richard} kill'd him.
2818   From forth the kennell of thy wombe hath crept
2819   A Hell- hound that doth hunt vs all to death:
2820   That Dogge, that had his teeth before his eyes,
2821   To worry Lambes, and lap their gentle blood:
2822   That foule defacer of Gods handy worke:
2823   That reignes in gauled eyes of weeping soules:
2824   That excellent grand Tyrant of the earth,
2825   Thy wombe let loose to chase vs to our graues.
2826   O vpright, iust, and true- disposing God,
2827   How do I thanke thee, that this carnall Curre
      <P s4v>
2828   Prayes on the issue of his Mothers body,
2829   And makes her Pue- fellow with others mone.
2830   <S {Dut}.> Oh {Harries} wife, triumph not in my woes:
2831   God witnesse with me, I haue wept for thine.
2832   <S {Mar}.> Beare with me: I am hungry for reuenge,
2833   And now I cloy me with beholding it.
2834   Thy {Edward} he is dead, that kill'd my {Edward},
2835   The other {Edward} dead, to quit my {Edward}:
2836   Yong Yorke, he is but boote, because both they
2837   Matcht not the high perfection of my losse.
2838   Thy {Clarence} he is dead, that stab'd my {Edward},
2839   And the beholders of this franticke play,
2840   Th' adulterate {Hastings}, {Riuers}, {Vaughan}, {Gray},
2841   Vntimely smother'd in their dusky Graues.
2842   {#Richard} yet liues, Hels blacke Intelligencer,
2843   Onely reseru'd their Factor, to buy soules,
2844   And send them thither: But at hand, at hand
2845   Insues his pittious and vnpittied end.
2846   Earth gapes, #Hell burnes, Fiends roare, Saints pray,
2847   To haue him sodainly conuey'd from hence:
2848   Cancell his bond of life, deere God I pray,
2849   That I may liue and say, The Dogge is dead.
2850   <S {Qu}.> O thou did'st prophesie, the time would come,
2851   That I should wish for thee to helpe me curse
2852   That bottel'd Spider, that foule bunch- back'd Toad.
2853   <S {Mar}.> I call'd thee then, vaine flourish of my fortune:
2854   I call'd thee then, poore Shadow, painted Queen,
2855   The presentation of but what I was;
2856   The flattering Index of a direfull Pageant;
2857   One heau'd #a high, to be hurl'd downe below:
2858   A Mother onely mockt with two faire Babes;
2859   A dreame of what thou wast, a garish Flagge
2860   To be the ayme of euery dangerous Shot;
2861   A signe of Dignity, a Breath, a Bubble;
2862   A Queene in ieast, onely to fill the Scene.
2863   Where is thy Husband now? Where be thy Brothers?
2864   Where be thy two Sonnes? Wherein dost thou Ioy?
2865  *Who sues, and kneeles, and sayes, God saue the Queene?
2866   Where be the bending Peeres that flattered thee?
2867   Where be the thronging Troopes that followed thee?
2868   Decline all this, and see what now thou art.
2869   For happy Wife, a most distressed Widdow:
2870   For ioyfull Mother, one that wailes the name:
2871   For one being sued #too, one that humbly sues:
2872   For Queene, a very Caytiffe, crown'd with care:
2873   For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me:
2874   For she being feared of all, now fearing one:
2875   For she commanding all, obey'd of none.
2876   Thus hath the course of Iustice whirl'd about,
2877   And left thee but a very prey to time,
2878   Hauing no more but Thought of what thou wast.
2879   To torture thee the more, being what thou art,
2880   Thou didst vsurpe my place, and dost thou not
2881   Vsurpe the iust proportion of my Sorrow?
2882   Now thy proud Necke, beares halfe my burthen'd yoke,
2883   From which, euen heere I slip my wearied head,
2884   And leaue the burthen of it all, on thee.
2885   Farwell Yorkes wife, and Queene of sad mischance,
2886   These English woes, shall make me smile in France.
2887   <S {Qu}.> O thou well skill'd in Curses, stay a- while,
2888   And teach me how to curse mine enemies.
2889   <S {Mar}.> Forbeare to sleepe the night, and fast the day:
2890   Compare dead happinesse, with liuing woe:
2891   Thinke that thy Babes were sweeter then they were,
2892   And he that slew them fowler then he is:
2893   Bett'ring thy losse, makes the bad causer worse,
2894   Reuoluing this, will teach thee how to Curse.
2895  *<S {Qu}.> My words are dull, O quicken them with thine.
2896   <S {Mar}.> Thy woes will make them sharpe,
2897   And pierce like mine.  <D {Exit Margaret}.>
2898   <S {Dut}.> Why should calamity be full of words?
2899   <S {Qu}.> Windy Atturnies to their Clients Woes,
2900   Ayery succeeders of intestine ioyes,
2901   Poore breathing Orators of miseries,
2902   Let them haue scope, though what they will impart,
2903   Helpe nothing els, yet do they ease the hart.
2904   <S {Dut}.> If so then, be not Tongue- ty'd: go with me,
2905   And in the breath of bitter words, let's smother
2906   My damned Son, that thy two sweet Sonnes smother'd.
2907   The Trumpet sounds, be copious in exclaimes.
2908   <D {Enter King Richard, and his Traine}.>
2909   <S {Rich}.> Who intercepts me in my Expedition?
2910   <S {Dut}.> O she, that might haue intercepted thee
2911   By strangling thee in her accursed wombe,
2912   From all the slaughters (Wretch) that thou hast done.
2913  *<S {Qu}.> Hid'st thou that Forhead with a Golden Crowne
2914   Where't should be branded, if that right were right?
2915   The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that Crowne,
2916   And the dyre death of my poore Sonnes, and Brothers.
2917   Tell me thou Villaine- slaue, where are my Children?
2918   <S {Dut}.> Thou Toad, thou Toade,
2919   Where is thy Brother {Clarence}?
2920   And little {Ned Plantagenet} his Sonne?
2921   <S {Qu}.> Where is the gentle {Riuers}, {Vaughan}, {Gray}?
2922   <S {Dut}.> Where is kinde {Hastings}?
2923  *<S {Rich}.> A flourish Trumpets, strike Alarum Drummes:
2924   Let not the Heauens heare these Tell- tale women
2925   Raile on the Lords Annointed. Strike I say.
2926   <D {Flourish.  Alarums}.>
2927   Either be patient, and intreat me fayre,
2928   Or with the clamorous report of Warre,
2929   Thus will I drowne your exclamations.
2930   <S {Dut}.> Art thou my Sonne?
2931   <S {Rich}.> #I, I thanke God, my Father, and your selfe.
2932   <S {Dut}.> Then patiently heare my impatience.
2933   <S {Rich}.> Madam, I haue a touch of your condition,
2934   That cannot brooke the accent of reproofe.
2935   <S {Dut}.> O let me speake.
2936   <S {Rich}.> Do then, but Ile not heare.
2937   <S {Dut}.> I will be milde, and gentle in my words.
2938   <S {Rich}.> And breefe (good Mother) for I am in #hast.
2939   <S {Dut}.> Art thou so hasty? I haue staid for thee
2940   (God knowes) in torment and in agony.
2941   <S {Rich}.> And came I not at last to comfort you?
2942   <S {Dut}.> No by the holy Rood, thou know'st it well,
2943   Thou cam'st on earth, to make the earth my #Hell.
2944   A greeuous burthen was thy Birth to me,
2945   Tetchy and wayward was thy Infancie.
2946  *Thy School- daies frightfull, desp'rate, wilde, and furious,
2947   Thy prime of Manhood, daring, bold, and venturous:
2948   Thy Age confirm'd, proud, subtle, slye, and bloody,
2949   More milde, but yet more harmfull; Kinde in hatred:
2950   What comfortable houre canst thou name,
2951   That euer grac'd me with thy company?
2952   <S {Rich}.> Faith none, but {Humfrey Hower},
2953   That call'd your Grace
2954   To Breakefast once, forth of my company.
2955   If I be so disgracious in your eye,
2956   Let me march on, and not offend you Madam.
2957   Strike vp the Drumme.
2958   <S {Dut}.> I prythee heare me speake.
      <P s5>
2959   <S {Rich}.> You speake too bitterly.
2960   <S {Dut}.> Heare me a word:
2961   For I shall neuer speake to thee againe.
2962   <S {Rich}.> So.
2963   <S {Dut}.> Either thou wilt dye, by Gods iust ordinance
2964   Ere from this warre thou turne a Conqueror:
2965   Or I with greefe and extreame Age shall perish,
2966   And neuer more behold thy face againe.
2967   Therefore take with thee my most greeuous Curse,
2968   Which in the day of Battell tyre thee more
2969   Then all the compleat Armour that thou wear'st.
2970   My Prayers on the aduerse party fight,
2971   And there the little soules of {Edwards} Children,
2972   Whisper the Spirits of thine Enemies,
2973   And promise them Successe and Victory:
2974   Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end:
2975   Shame serues thy life, and doth thy death attend.  <D {Exit}.>
2976  *<S {Qu}.> Though far more cause, yet much lesse spirit to curse
2977   Abides in me, I say Amen to her.
2978   <S {Rich}.> Stay Madam, I must talke a word with you.
2979   <S {Qu}.> I haue no more sonnes of the Royall Blood
2980   For thee to slaughter. For my Daughters ({Richard})
2981   They shall be praying Nunnes, not weeping Queenes:
2982   And therefore leuell not to hit their liues.
2983   <S {Rich}.> You haue a daughter call'd {Elizabeth},
2984   Vertuous and Faire, Royall and Gracious?
2985   <S {Qu}.> And must she dye for this? O let her liue,
2986   And Ile corrupt her Manners, staine her Beauty,
2987   Slander my Selfe, as false to {Edwards} bed:
2988   Throw ouer her the vaile of Infamy,
2989   So she may liue vnscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
2990   I will confesse she was not {Edwards} daughter.
2991  *<S {Rich}.> Wrong not her Byrth, she is a Royall Princesse.
2992   <S {Qu}.> To saue her life, Ile say she is not so.
2993   <S {Rich}.> Her life is safest onely in her byrth.
2994   <S {Qu}.> And onely in that safety, dyed her Brothers.
2995   <S {Rich}.> Loe at their Birth, good starres were opposite.
2996   <S {Qu}.> No, to their liues, #ill friends were contrary.
2997   <S {Rich}.> All vnauoyded is the doome of Destiny.
2998   <S {Qu}.> True: when auoyded grace makes Destiny.
2999   My Babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
3000   If grace had blest thee with a fairer life.
3001   <S {Rich}.> You speake as if that I had slaine my Cosins?
3002   <S {Qu}.> Cosins indeed, and by their Vnckle couzend,
3003   Of Comfort, Kingdome, Kindred, Freedome, Life,
3004   Whose hand soeuer lanch'd their tender hearts,
3005   Thy head (all indirectly) gaue direction.
3006   No doubt the murd'rous Knife was dull and blunt,
3007   Till it was whetted on thy stone- hard heart,
3008   To reuell in the Intrailes of my Lambes.
3009   But that still vse of greefe, makes wilde greefe tame,
3010   My tongue should to thy eares not name my Boyes,
3011   Till that my Nayles were anchor'd in thine eyes:
3012   And I in such a desp'rate Bay of death,
3013   Like a poore Barke, of sailes and tackling reft,
3014   Rush all to peeces on thy Rocky bosome.
3015   <S {Rich}.> Madam, so thriue I in my enterprize
3016   And dangerous successe of bloody warres,
3017   As I intend more good to you and yours,
3018   Then euer you and yours by me were harm'd.
3019   <S {Qu}.> What good is couer'd with the face of heauen,
3020   To be discouered, that can do me good.
3021  *<S {Rich}.> Th' aduancement of your children, gentle Lady
3022   <S {Qu}.> Vp to some Scaffold, there to lose their heads.
3023   <S {Rich}.> Vnto the dignity and height of Fortune,
3024   The high Imperiall Type of this earths glory.
3025   <S {Qu}.> Flatter my sorrow with report of it:
3026   Tell me, what State, what Dignity, what Honor,
3027   Canst thou demise to any childe of mine.
3028   <S {Rich}.> Euen all I haue; #I, and my selfe and all,
3029   Will I withall indow a childe of thine:
3030   So in the Lethe of thy angry soule,
3031   Thou drowne the sad remembrance of those wrongs,
3032   Which thou supposest I haue done to thee.
3033  *<S {Qu}.> Be breefe, least that the processe of thy kindnesse
3034   Last longer telling then thy kindnesse date.
3035   <S {Rich}.> Then know,
3036   That from my Soule, I loue thy Daughter.
3037  *<S {Qu}.> My daughters Mother thinkes it with her soule.
3038   <S {Rich}.> What do you thinke?
3039  *<S {Qu}.> That thou dost loue my daughter from thy soule
3040   So from thy Soules loue didst thou loue her Brothers,
3041   And from my hearts loue, I do thanke thee for it.
3042   <S {Rich}.> Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
3043   I meane that with my Soule I loue thy daughter,
3044   And do intend to make her Queene of England.
3045  *<S {Qu}.> Well then, who dost y meane shallbe her King.
3046   <S {Rich}.> Euen he that makes her Queene:
3047   Who else should bee?
3048   <S {Qu}.> What, thou?
3049   <S {Rich}.> Euen so: How thinke you of it?
3050   <S {Qu}.> How canst thou woo her?
3051   <S {Rich}.> That I would learne of you,
3052   As one being best acquainted with her humour.
3053   <S {Qu}.> And wilt thou learne of me?
3054   <S {Rich}.> Madam, with all my heart.
3055   <S {Qu}.> Send to her by the man that slew her Brothers.
3056   A paire of bleeding hearts: thereon ingraue
3057   {Edward} and {Yorke}, then haply will she weepe:
3058   Therefore present to her, as sometime {Margaret}
3059   Did to thy Father, steept in Rutlands blood,
3060   A hand- kercheefe, which say to her did dreyne
3061   The purple sappe from her sweet Brothers body,
3062   And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withall.
3063   If this inducement moue her not to loue,
3064   Send her a Letter of thy Noble deeds:
3065   Tell her, thou mad'st away her Vnckle {Clarence},
3066   Her Vnckle {Riuers}, #I (and for her sake)
3067   Mad'st quicke conueyance with her good Aunt {Anne}.
3068   <S {Rich}.> You mocke me Madam, this not the way
3069   To win your daughter.
3070   <S {Qu}.> There is no other way,
3071   Vnlesse thou could'st put on some other shape,
3072   And not be {Richard}, that hath done all this.
3073   <S {Ric}.> Say that I did all this for loue of her.
3074  *<S {Qu}.> Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
3075   Hauing bought loue, with such a bloody spoyle.
3076  *<S {Rich}.> Looke what is done, cannot be now amended:
3077   Men shall deale vnaduisedly sometimes,
3078   Which after- houres giues leysure to repent.
3079   If I did take the Kingdome from your Sonnes,
3080   To make amends, Ile giue it to your daughter:
3081   If I haue kill'd the issue of your wombe,
3082   To quicken your encrease, I will beget
3083   Mine yssue of your blood, vpon your Daughter:
3084   A Grandams name is little lesse in loue,
3085   Then is the doting Title of a Mother;
3086   They are as Children but one steppe below,
3087   Euen of your mettall, of your very blood:
3088   Of all one paine, saue for a night of groanes
3089   Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
3090   Your Children were vexation to your youth,
      <P s5v>
3091   But mine shall be a comfort to your Age,
3092   The losse you haue, is but a Sonne being King,
3093   And by that losse, your Daughter is made Queene.
3094   I cannot make you what amends I would,
3095   Therefore accept such kindnesse as I can.
3096   {Dorset} your Sonne, that with a fearfull soule
3097   Leads discontented steppes in Forraine soyle,
3098   This faire Alliance, quickly shall call home
3099   To high Promotions, and great Dignity.
3100   The King that calles your beauteous Daughter Wife,
3101   Familiarly shall call thy {Dorset}, Brother:
3102   Againe shall you be Mother to a King:
3103   And all the Ruines of distressefull Times,
3104   Repayr'd with double Riches of Content.
3105   What? we haue many goodly dayes to see:
3106   The liquid drops of Teares that you haue shed,
3107   Shall come againe, transform'd to Orient Pearle,
3108   Aduantaging their Loue, with interest
3109   Often- times double gaine of happinesse.
3110   Go then (my Mother) to thy Daughter go,
3111   Make bold her bashfull yeares, with your experience,
3112   Prepare her eares to heare a Woers Tale.
3113   Put in her tender heart, th' aspiring Flame
3114   Of Golden Soueraignty: Acquaint the Princesse
3115   With the sweet silent houres of Marriage ioyes:
3116   And when this Arme of mine hath chastised
3117   The petty Rebell, dull- brain'd {Buckingham},
3118   Bound with Triumphant Garlands will I come,
3119   And leade thy daughter to a Conquerors bed:
3120   To whom I will retaile my Conquest wonne,
3121   And she shalbe sole Victoresse, {Caesars Caesar}.
3122   <S {Qu}.> What were I best to say, her Fathers Brother
3123   Would be her Lord? Or shall I say her Vnkle?
3124   Or he that slew her Brothers, and her Vnkles?
3125   Vnder what Title shall I woo for thee,
3126   That God, the Law, my Honor, and her Loue,
3127   Can make seeme pleasing to her tender yeares?
3128   <S {Rich}.> Inferre faire Englands peace by this Alliance.
3129  *<S {Qu}.> Which she shall purchase with stil lasting warre.
3130  *<S {Rich}.> Tell her, the King that may command, intreats.
3131  *<S {Qu}.> That at her hands, which the kings King forbids.
3132   <S {Rich}.> Say she shall be a High and Mighty Queene.
3133   <S {Qu}.> To vaile the Title, as her Mother doth.
3134   <S {Rich}.> Say I will loue her euerlastingly.
3135   <S {Qu}.> But how long shall that title euer last?
3136   <S {Rich}.> Sweetly in force, vnto her faire liues end.
3137   <S {Qu}.> But how long fairely shall her sweet life last?
3138   <S {Rich}.> As long as Heauen and Nature lengthens it.
3139   <S {Qu}.> As long as #Hell and {Richard} likes of it.
3140   <S {Rich}.> Say, I her Soueraigne, am her Subiect low.
3141   <S {Qu}.> But she your Subiect, lothes such Soueraignty.
3142   <S {Rich}.> Be eloquent in my behalfe to her.
3143   <S {Qu}.> An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told.
3144   <S {Rich}.> Then plainly to her, tell my louing tale.
3145   <S {Qu}.> Plaine and not honest, is too harsh a style.
3146   <S {Rich}.> Your Reasons are too shallow, and #to quicke.
3147   <S {Qu}.> O no, my Reasons are too deepe and dead,
3148   Too deepe and dead (poore Infants) in their graues,
3149   Harpe on it still shall I, till heart- strings breake.
3150   <S {Rich}.> Harpe not on that string Madam, that is past.
3151   Now by my George, my Garter, and my Crowne.
3152   <S {Qu}.> Prophan'd, dishonor'd, and the third vsurpt.
3153   <S {Rich}.> I sweare.
3154   <S {Qu}.> By nothing, for this is no Oath:
3155   Thy George prophan'd, hath lost his Lordly Honor;
3156   Thy Garter blemish'd, pawn'd his Knightly Vertue;
3157   Thy Crowne vsurp'd, disgrac'd his Kingly Glory:
3158   If something thou would'st sweare to be beleeu'd,
3159   Sweare then by something, that thou hast not wrong'd.
3160   <S {Rich}.> Then by my Selfe.
3161   <S {Qu}.> Thy Selfe, is selfe- misvs'd.
3162   <S {Rich}.> Now by the World.
3163   <S {Qu}.> 'Tis full of thy foule wrongs.
3164   <S {Rich}.> My Fathers death.
3165   <S {Qu}.> Thy life hath it dishonor'd.
3166   <S {Rich}.> Why then, by Heauen.
3167   <S {Qu}.> Heauens wrong is most of all:
3168   If thou didd'st feare to breake an Oath with him,
3169   The vnity the King my husband made,
3170   Thou had'st not broken, nor my Brothers died.
3171   If thou had'st fear'd to breake an oath by him,
3172   Th' Imperiall mettall, circling now thy head,
3173   Had grac'd the tender temples of my Child,
3174   And both the Princes had bene breathing heere,
3175   Which now two tender Bed- fellowes for dust,
3176   Thy broken Faith hath made the prey for Wormes.
3177   What can'st thou sweare by now.
3178   <S {Rich}.> The time to come.
3179   <S {Qu}.> That thou hast wronged in the time ore- past:
3180   For I my selfe haue many teares to wash
3181   Heereafter time, for time past, wrong'd by thee.
3182   The Children liue, whose Fathers thou hast slaughter'd,
3183   Vngouern'd youth, to waile it with their age:
3184   The Parents liue, whose Children thou hast butcher'd,
3185   Old barren Plants, to waile it with their Age.
3186   Sweare not by time to come, for that thou hast
3187   Misvs'd ere vs'd, by times ill- vs'd repast.
3188   <S {Rich}.> As I entend to prosper, and repent:
3189   So thriue I in my dangerous Affayres
3190   Of hostile Armes: My selfe, my selfe confound:
3191   Heauen, and Fortune barre me happy houres:
3192   Day, yeeld me not thy light; nor Night, thy rest.
3193   Be opposite all Planets of good lucke
3194   To my proceeding, if with deere hearts loue,
3195   Immaculate deuotion, holy thoughts,
3196   I tender not thy beautious Princely daughter.
3197   In her, consists my Happinesse, and thine:
3198   Without her, followes to my selfe, and thee;
3199   Her selfe, the Land, and many a Christian soule,
3200   Death, Desolation, Ruine, and Decay:
3201   It cannot be auoyded, but by this:
3202   It will not be auoyded, but by this.
3203   Therefore deare Mother (I must call you so)
3204   Be the Atturney of my loue to her:
3205   Pleade what I will be, not what I haue beene;
3206   Not my deserts, but what I will deserue:
3207   Vrge the Necessity and state of times,
3208   And be not peeuish found, in great Designes.
3209   <S {Qu}.> Shall I be tempted of the Diuel thus?
3210   <S {Rich}.> #I, if the Diuell tempt you to do good.
3211   <S {Qu}.> Shall I forget my selfe, to be my selfe.
3212  *<S {Rich}.> #I, if your selfes remembrance wrong your selfe.
3213   <S {Qu}.> Yet thou didst kil my Children.
3214   <S {Rich}.> But in your daughters wombe I bury them.
3215   Where in that Nest of Spicery they will breed
3216   Selues of themselues, to your recomforture.
3217   <S {Qu}.> Shall I go win my daughter to thy #will?
3218   <S {Rich}.> And be a happy Mother by the deed.
3219   <S {Qu}.> I go, write to me very shortly,
3220   And you shal vnderstand from me her mind.  <D {Exit Q[ueene]}.>
3221   <S {Rich}.> Beare her my true loues kisse, and so farewell.
3222   Relenting Foole, and shallow- changing Woman.
      <P s6><C A>
3223   How now, what newes?
3224   <D {Enter Ratcliffe}.>
3225  *<S {Rat}.> Most mightie Soueraigne, on the Westerne Coast
3226   Rideth a puissant Nauie: to our Shores
3227   Throng many doubtfull hollow- hearted friends,
3228   Vnarm'd, and vnresolu'd to beat them backe.
3229   'Tis thought, that {Richmond} is their Admirall:
3230   And there they hull, expecting but the aide
3231   Of {Buckingham}, to welcome them ashore.
3232  *<S {Rich}.> Some light- foot friend post to y Duke of Norfolk:
3233   {Ratcliffe} thy selfe, or {Catesby}, where is hee?
3234   <S {Cat}.> Here, my good Lord.
3235   <S {Rich}.> {Catesby}, flye to the Duke.
3236   <S {Cat}.> I will, my Lord, with all conuenient haste.
3237   <S {Rich}.> {Catesby} come hither, poste to Salisbury:
3238   When thou com'st thither: Dull vnmindfull Villaine,
3239   Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?
3240  *<S {Cat}.> First, mighty Liege, tell me your Highnesse pleasure,
3241   What from your Grace I shall deliuer to him.
3242   <S {Rich}.> O true, good {Catesby}, bid him leuie straight
3243   The greatest strength and power that he can make,
3244   And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
3245   <S {Cat}.> I goe.  <D {Exit}.>
3246  *<S {Rat}.> What, may it please you, shall I doe at Salis-bury?
3247  _
3248  *<S {Rich}.> Why, what would'st thou doe there, before I
3249   goe?
3250   <S {Rat}.> Your Highnesse told me I should poste before.
3251   <S {Rich}.> My minde is chang'd:
3252   <D {Enter Lord Stanley}.>
3253   {#Stanley}, what newes with you?
3254  *<S {Sta}.> None, good my Liege, to please you with y hearing,
3255   Nor none so bad, but well may be reported.
3256   <S {Rich}.> Hoyday, a Riddle, neither good nor bad:
3257   What need'st thou runne so many miles about,
3258   When thou mayest tell thy Tale the neerest way?
3259   Once more, what newes?
3260   <S {Stan}.> {Richmond} is on the Seas.
3261   <S {Rich}.> There let him sinke, and be the Seas on him,
3262   White- liuer'd Runnagate, what doth he there?
3263  *<S {Stan}.> I know not, mightie Soueraigne, but by guesse.
3264   <S {Rich}.> Well, as you guesse.
3265   <S {Stan}.> Stirr'd vp by {Dorset}, {Buckingham}, and {Morton},
3266   He makes for England, here to clayme the Crowne.
3267  *<S {Rich}.> Is the Chayre emptie? is the Sword vnsway'd?
3268   Is the King dead? the Empire vnpossest?
3269   What Heire of {Yorke} is there aliue, but wee?
3270   And who is Englands King, but great {Yorkes} Heire?
3271   Then tell me, what makes he vpon the Seas?
3272   <S {Stan}.> Vnlesse for that, my Liege, I cannot guesse.
3273   <S {Rich}.> Vnlesse for that he comes to be your Liege,
3274   You cannot guesse wherefore the Welchman comes.
3275   Thou wilt reuolt, and flye to him, I feare.
3276   <S {Stan}.> No, my good Lord, therefore mistrust me not.
3277   <S {Rich}.> Where is thy Power then, to beat him back?
3278   Where be thy Tenants, and thy followers?
3279   Are they not now vpon the Westerne Shore,
3280   Safe- conducting the Rebels from their Shippes?
3281  *<S {Stan}.> No, my good Lord, my friends are in the
3282   North.
3283  *<S {Rich}.> Cold friends to me: what do they in the North,
3284   When they should serue their Soueraigne in the West?
3285  *<S {Stan}.> They haue not been commanded, mighty King:
3286   Pleaseth your Maiestie to giue me leaue,
3287   Ile muster vp my friends, and meet your Grace,
3288   Where, and what time your Maiestie shall please.
3289  *<S {Rich}.> #I, thou would'st be gone, to ioyne with {Richmond}:
3290   But Ile not trust thee.
3291   <S {Stan}.> Most mightie Soueraigne,
3292   You haue no cause to hold my friendship doubtfull,
3293   I neuer was, nor neuer will be false.
3294   <S {Rich}.> Goe then, and muster men: but leaue behind
3295   Your Sonne {George Stanley}: looke your heart be firme,
3296   Or else his Heads assurance is but fraile.
3297   <S {Stan}.> So deale with him, as I proue true to you.
3298   <D {Exit Stanley}.>
3299   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
3300   <S {Mess}.> My gracious Soueraigne, now in Deuonshire,
3301   As I by friends am well aduertised,

3303   Bishop of Exeter, his elder Brother,

3307   And euery houre more Competitors
3308   Flocke to the Rebels, and their power growes strong.
3309   <D {Enter another Messenger}.>

3315   Is, that by sudden Floods, and fall of Waters,
3316   {Buckinghams} Armie is dispers'd and scatter'd,
3317   And he himselfe wandred away alone,

3320   There is my Purse, to cure that Blow of thine.
3321   Hath any well- aduised   friend proclaym'd
3322   Reward to him that brings the Traytor in?

3327   But this good comfort bring I to your Highnesse,
3328   The Brittaine Nauie is dispers'd by Tempest.
3329   {Richmond} in Dorsetshire sent out a Boat
3330   Vnto the shore, to aske those on the Banks,
3331   If they were his Assistants, yea, or no?
3332   Who answer'd him, they came from {Buckingham},
3333   Vpon his partie: he mistrusting them,
3334   Hoys'd sayle, and made his course againe for Brittaine.
3335  *<S {Rich}.> March on, march on, since we are vp in Armes,
3336   If not to fight with forraine Enemies,
3337   Yet to beat downe these Rebels here at home.
3338   <D {Enter Catesby}.>

3342   Is colder Newes, but yet they must be told.
3343  *<S {Rich}.> Away towards Salsbury, while we reason here,
3344   A Royall battell might be wonne and lost:

3346   To Salsbury, the rest march on with me.  <D {Florish. Exeunt}>

3350   That in the stye of the most deadly Bore,
3351   My Sonne {George Stanley} is frankt vp in hold:
3352   If I reuolt, off goes yong {Georges} head,
3353   The feare of that, holds off my present ayde.
3354   So get thee gone: commend me to thy Lord.
3355   Withall say, that the Queene hath heartily consented
3356   He should espouse {Elizabeth} hir daughter.
3357   But tell me, where is Princely Richmond now?
3358   <S {Chri}.> At Penbroke, or at Hertford West in Wales.
3359   <S {Der}.> What men of Name resort to him.

3361   Sir {Gilbert Talbot}, Sir {William Stanley},
3362   {Oxford}, redoubted {Pembroke}, Sir {Iames Blunt},
3363   And {Rice ap Thomas}, with a valiant Crew,
3364   And many other of great name and worth:
3365   And towards London do they bend their power,
3366   If by the way they be not fought withall.
3367   <S {Der}.> Well hye thee to thy Lord: I kisse his hand,
3368   My Letter will resolue him of my minde.
3369   Farewell.  <D {Exeunt}>

3374   <S {Sher}.> No my good Lord, therefore be patient.
3375   <S {Buc}.> {Hastings}, and {Edwards} children, {Gray} & {Riuers},
3376   Holy King {Henry}, and thy faire Sonne {Edward},
3377   {Vaughan}, and all that haue miscarried
3378   By vnder- hand corrupted foule iniustice,
3379   If that your moody discontented soules,
3380   Do through the clowds behold this present houre,
3381   Euen for reuenge mocke my destruction.
3382   This is All- soules day (Fellow) is it not?
3383   <S {Sher}.> It is.
3384  *<S {Buc}.> Why then Al- soules day, is my bodies doomsday
3385   This is the day, which in King {Edwards} time
3386   I wish'd might fall on me, when I was found
3387   False to his Children, and his Wiues Allies.
3388   This is the day, wherein I wisht to fall
3389   By the false Faith of him whom most I trusted.
3390   This, this All- soules day to my fearfull Soule,
3391   Is the determin'd respit of my wrongs:
3392   That high All- seer, which I dallied with,
3393   Hath turn'd my fained Prayer on my head,
3394   And giuen in earnest, what I begg'd in iest.
3395   Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
3396   To turne their owne points in their Masters bosomes.
3397   Thus {Margarets} curse falles heauy on my necke:
3398   When he (quoth she) shall split thy heart with sorrow,
3399   Remember {Margaret} was a Prophetesse:
3400   Come leade me Officers to the blocke of shame,
3401   Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

3408   Thus farre into the bowels of the Land,
3409   Haue we marcht on without impediment;
3410   And heere receiue we from our Father {Stanley}
3411   Lines of faire comfort and encouragement:

3413   (That spoyl'd your Summer Fields, and fruitfull Vines)
3414  *Swilles your warm blood like wash, & makes his trough
3415   In your embowel'd bosomes: This foule Swine
3416   Is now euen in the Centry of this Isle,
3417   Ne're to the Towne of Leicester, as we learne:
3418   From Tamworth thither, is but one dayes march.
3419   In Gods name cheerely on, couragious Friends,
3420   To reape the Haruest of perpetuall peace,
3421   By this one bloody tryall of sharpe Warre.
3422   <S {Oxf}.> Euery mans Conscience is a thousand men,
3423   To fight against this guilty Homicide.
3424   <S {Her}.> I doubt not but his Friends will turne to vs.
3425  *<S {Blunt}.> He hath no friends, but what are friends for fear,
3426   Which in his deerest neede will flye from him.
3427  *<S {Richm}.> All for our vantage, then in Gods name march,
3428   True Hope is swift, and flyes with Swallowes wings,
3429   Kings it makes Gods, and meaner creatures Kings.

3435   <S {Sur}.> My heart is ten times lighter then my lookes.
3436   <S {Rich}.> My Lord of Norfolke.
3437   <S {Nor}.> Heere most gracious Liege.
3438   <S {Rich}.> Norfolke, we must haue knockes:
3439   Ha, must we not?
3440   <S {Nor}.> We must both giue and take my louing Lord.
3441   <S {Rich}.> Vp with my Tent, heere wil I lye to night,
3442   But where to morrow? Well, all's one for that.
3443   Who hath descried the number of the Traitors?
3444   <S {Nor}.> Six or seuen thousand is their vtmost power.
3445   <S {Rich}.> Why our Battalia trebbles that account:
3446   Besides, the Kings name is a Tower of strength,
3447   Which they vpon the aduerse Faction want.
3448   Vp with the Tent: Come Noble Gentlemen,
3449   Let vs suruey the vantage of the ground.
3450   Call for some men of sound direction:
      <P t1>

3455   <S {Richm}.> The weary Sunne, hath made a Golden set,
3456   And by the bright Tract of his fiery Carre,
3457   Giues token of a goodly day to morrow.
3458   Sir {William Brandon}, you shall beare my Standard:
3459   Giue me some Inke and Paper in my Tent:
3460   Ile draw the Forme and Modell of our Battaile,
3461   Limit each Leader to his seuerall Charge,
3462   And part in iust proportion our small Power.
3463   My Lord of Oxford, you Sir {William Brandon},
3464   And your Sir {Walter Herbert} stay with me:
3465   The Earle of Pembroke keepes his Regiment;
3466   Good Captaine {Blunt}, beare my goodnight to him,
3467   And by the second houre in the Morning,
3468   Desire the Earle to see me in my Tent:
3469   Yet one thing more (good Captaine) do for me:
3470   Where is Lord {Stanley} quarter'd, do you know?
3471   <S {Blunt}.> Vnlesse I haue mistane his Colours much,
3472   (Which well I am assur'd I haue not done)
3473   His Regiment lies halfe a Mile at least
3474   South, from the mighty Power of the King.
3475   <S {Richm}.> If without perill it be possible,
3476  *Sweet {Blunt}, make some good meanes to speak with him
3477   And giue him from me, this most needfull Note.
3478   <S {Blunt}.> Vpon my life, my Lord, Ile vndertake it,
3479   And so God giue you quiet rest to night.
3480   <S {Richm}.> Good night good Captaine {Blunt}:

3488   <S {King}.> I will not sup to night,
3489   Giue me some Inke and Paper:
3490   What, is my Beauer easier then it was?
3491   And all my Armour laid into my Tent?
3492   <S {Cat}.> It is my Liege: and all things are in readinesse.
3493   <S {Rich}.> Good Norfolke, hye thee to thy charge,

3501   To {Stanleys} Regiment: bid him bring his power
3502   Before Sun- rising, least his Sonne {George} fall
3503   Into the blinde Caue of eternall night.
3504   Fill me a Bowle of Wine: Giue me a Watch,
3505   Saddle white Surrey for the Field to morrow:
3506  *Look that my Staues be sound, & not too heauy. {Ratcliff}.
3507   <S {Rat}.> My Lord.
3508  *<S {Rich}.> Saw'st the melancholly Lord Northumberland?
3509   <S {Rat}.> {Thomas} the Earle of Surrey, and himselfe,
3510   Much about Cockshut time, from Troope to Troope
3511   Went through the Army, chearing vp the Souldiers.
3512  *<S {King}.> So, I am satisfied: Giue me a Bowle of Wine,
3513   I haue not that Alacrity of Spirit,
3514   Nor cheere of Minde that I was wont to haue.
3515   Set it downe. Is Inke and Paper ready?
3516   <S {Rat}.> It is my Lord.

3523   Be to thy Person, Noble Father in Law.
3524   Tell me, how fares our Noble Mother?
3525   <S {Der}.> I by Attourney, blesse thee from thy Mother,
3526   Who prayes continually for Richmonds good:
3527   So much for that. The silent houres steale on,
3528   And flakie darkenesse breakes within the East.
3529   In breefe, for so the season bids vs be,
3530   Prepare thy Battell early in the Morning,
3531   And put thy Fortune to th' Arbitrement
3532   Of bloody stroakes, and mortall staring Warre:
3533   I, as I may, that which I would, I cannot,
3534   With best aduantage will deceiue the time,
3535   And ayde thee in this doubtfull shocke of Armes.
3536   But on thy side I may not be too forward,
3537   Least being seene, thy Brother, tender {George}
3538   Be executed in his Fathers sight.
3539   Farewell: the leysure, and the fearfull time
3540   Cuts off the ceremonious Vowes of Loue,
3541   And ample enterchange of sweet Discourse,
3542   Which so long sundred Friends should dwell vpon:

3629   O, in the Battaile think on Buckingham,
3630   And dye in terror of thy guiltinesse.
3631   Dreame on, dreame on, of bloody deeds and death,
3632   Fainting dispaire; dispairing yeeld thy breath.
3633   <D {Ghost} {to Richm[ond]}.> I dyed for hope
3634   Ere I could lend thee Ayde;
3635   But cheere thy heart, and be thou not dismayde:
3636   God, and good Angels fight on Richmonds side,
3637   And {Richard} fall in height of all his pride.
3638   <D {#Richard starts out of his dreame}.>
3639  *<S {Rich}.> Giue me another Horse, bind vp my Wounds:
3640   Haue mercy Iesu. Soft, I did but dreame.
3641   O coward Conscience? how dost thou afflict me?
3642   The Lights burne blew. It is not dead midnight.
3643   Cold fearefull drops stand on my trembling flesh.
3644   What? do I feare my Selfe? There's none else by,
3645   {#Richard} loues {Richard}, that is, I am I.
3646   Is there a Murtherer heere? No; Yes, I am:
3647   Then flye; What from my Selfe? Great reason: why?
3648   Lest I Reuenge. What? my Selfe vpon my Selfe?
3649   Alacke, I loue my Selfe. Wherefore? For any good
3650   That I my Selfe, haue done vnto my Selfe?
3651   O no. Alas, I rather hate my Selfe,
3652   For hatefull Deeds committed by my Selfe.
3653   I am a Villaine: yet I Lye, I am not.
3654   Foole, of thy Selfe speake well: Foole, do not flatter.
3655   My Conscience hath a thousand seuerall Tongues,
3656   And euery Tongue brings in a seuerall Tale,
3657   And euerie Tale condemnes me for a Villaine;
3658   Periurie, in the high'st Degree,
3659   Murther, sterne murther, in the dyr'st degree,
3660   All seuerall sinnes, all vs'd in each degree,
3661   Throng all to'th' Barre, crying all, Guilty, Guilty.
3662   I shall dispaire, there is no Creature loues me;
3663   And if I die, no soule shall pittie me.
3664   Nay, wherefore should they? Since that I my Selfe,
3665   Finde in my Selfe, no pittie to my Selfe.
3666   Me thought, the Soules of all that I had murther'd
3667   Came to my Tent, and euery one did threat
3668   To morrowes vengeance on the head of {Richard}.
3669   <D {Enter Ratcliffe}.>
3670   <S {Rat}.> My Lord.
3671   <S {King}.> Who's there?
3672  *<S {Rat}.> {Ratcliffe}, my Lord, 'tis I: the early Village Cock
3673   Hath twice done salutation to the Morne,
3674   Your Friends are vp, and buckle on their Armour.
3675   <S {King}.> O {Ratcliffe}, I feare, I feare.
3676  *<S {Rat}.> Nay good my Lord, be not affraid of Shadows.
3677   <S {King}.> By the Apostle {Paul}, shadowes to night
3678   Haue stroke more terror to the soule of {Richard},
3679   Then can the substance of ten thousand Souldiers
3680   Armed in proofe, and led by shallow {Richmond}.
3681   'Tis not yet neere day. Come go with me,
3682   Vnder our Tents Ile play the Ease- dropper,
3683   To heare if any meane to shrinke from me.
3684   <D {Exeunt Richard & Ratliffe},>
3685   <D {Enter the Lords to Richmond sitting}
3686   {in his Tent}.>
3687   <S {Richm}.> Good morrow Richmond.
3688   <S {Rich}.> Cry mercy Lords, and watchfull Gentlemen,
3689   That you haue tane a tardie sluggard heere?
3690   <S {Lords}.> How haue you slept my Lord?
3691   <S {Rich}.> The sweetest sleepe,
3692   And fairest boading Dreames,
3693   That euer entred in a drowsie head,
3694   Haue I since your departure had my Lords.
3695  *Me thought their Soules, whose bodies {Rich[ard]}. murther'd,
3696   Came to my Tent, and cried on Victory:
3697   I promise you my Heart is very iocond,
3698   In the remembrance of so faire a dreame,
3699   How farre into the Morning is it Lords?
3700   <S {Lor}.> Vpon the stroke of foure.
3701  *<S {Rich}.> Why then 'tis time to Arme, and giue direction.
3702   <D {His Oration to his Souldiers}.>
3703   More then I haue said, louing Countrymen,
3704   The leysure and inforcement of the time
3705   Forbids to dwell vpon: yet remember this,
      <P t2>
3706   God, and our good cause, fight vpon our side,
3707   The Prayers of holy Saints and wronged soules,
3708   Like high rear'd Bulwarkes, stand before our Faces,
3709   ({#Richard} except) those whom we fight against,
3710   Had rather haue vs win, then him they follow.
3711   For, what is he they follow? Truly Gentlemen,
3712   A bloudy Tyrant, and a Homicide:
3713   One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
3714   One that made meanes to come by what he hath,
3715  *And slaughter'd those that were the meanes to help him:
3716   A base foule Stone, made precious by the soyle
3717   Of Englands Chaire, where he is falsely set:
3718   One that hath euer beene Gods Enemy.
3719   Then if you fight against Gods Enemy,
3720   God will in iustice ward you as his Soldiers.
3721   If you do sweare to put a Tyrant downe,
3722   You sleepe in peace, the Tyrant being slaine:
3723   If you do fight against your Countries Foes,
3724   Your Countries Fat shall pay your paines the hyre.
3725   If you do fight in safegard of your wiues,
3726   Your wiues shall welcome home the Conquerors.
3727   If you do free your Children from the Sword,
3728   Your Childrens Children quits it in your Age.
3729   Then in the name of God and all these rights,
3730   Aduance your Standards, draw your willing Swords.
3731   For me, the ransome of my bold attempt,
3732   Shall be this cold Corpes on the earth's cold face.
3733   But if I thriue, the gaine of my attempt,
3734   The least of you shall share his part thereof.
3735  *Sound Drummes and Trumpets boldly, and cheerefully,
3736   God, and Saint {George}, {Richmond}, and Victory.
3737   <D {Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe, and Catesby}.>
3738  *<S {K}.> What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
3739   <S {Rat}.> That he was neuer trained vp in Armes.
3740   <S {King}.> He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
3741   <S {Rat}.> He smil'd and said, the better for our purpose.
3742   <S {King}.> He was in the right, and so indeed it is.
3743   Tell the clocke there.  <D {Clocke strikes}.>
3744   Giue me a Kalender: Who saw the Sunne to day?
3745   <S {Rat}.> Not I my Lord.
3746   <S {King}.> Then he disdaines to shine: for by the Booke
3747   He should haue brau'd the East an houre ago,
3748   A blacke day will it be to somebody. {Ratcliffe}.
3749   <S {Rat}.> My Lord.
3750   <S {King}.> The Sun will not be seene to day,
3751   The sky doth frowne, and lowre vpon our Army.
3752   I would these dewy teares were from the ground.
3753   Not shine to day? Why, what is that to me
3754   More then to Richmond? For the selfe- same Heauen
3755   That frownes on me, lookes sadly vpon him.
3756   <D {Enter Norfolke}.>
3757   <S {Nor}.> Arme, arme, my Lord: the foe vaunts in the field.
3758   <S {King}.> Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison my horse.
3759   Call vp Lord {Stanley}, bid him bring his power,
3760   I will leade forth my Soldiers to the plaine,
3761   And thus my Battell shal be ordred.
3762   My Foreward shall be drawne in length,
3763   Consisting equally of Horse and Foot:
3764   Our Archers shall be placed in the mid'st;
3765   {Iohn} Duke of Norfolke, {Thomas} Earle of Surrey,
3766   Shall haue the leading of the Foot and Horse.
3767   They thus directed, we will follow
3768   In the maine Battell, whose puissance on either side
3769   Shall be well- winged with our cheefest Horse:
3770   This, and Saint George to boote.
3771   What think'st thou Norfolke.
3772   <S {Nor}.> A good direction warlike Soueraigne,
3773   This found I on my Tent this Morning.
3774   {Iockey of Norfolke, be not so bold},
3775   {For Dickon thy maister is bought and sold}.
3776   <S {King}.> A thing deuised by the Enemy.
3777   Go Gentlemen, euery man to his Charge,
3778   Let not our babling Dreames affright our soules:
3779   For Conscience is a word that Cowards vse,
3780   Deuis'd at first to keepe the strong in awe,
3781   Our strong armes be our Conscience, Swords our Law.
3782   March on, ioyne brauely, let vs too't pell mell,
3783   If not to heauen, then hand in hand to #Hell.
3784   What shall I say more then I haue inferr'd?
3785   Remember whom you are to cope withall,
3786   A sort of Vagabonds, Rascals, and Run- awayes,
3787   A scum of Brittaines, and base Lackey Pezants,
3788   Whom their o're- cloyed Country vomits forth
3789   To desperate Aduentures, and assur'd Destruction.
3790   You sleeping safe, they bring you to vnrest:
3791   You hauing Lands, and blest with beauteous wiues,
3792   They would restraine the one, distaine the other,
3793   And who doth leade them, but a paltry Fellow?
3794   Long kept in Britaine at our Mothers cost,
3795   A Milke- sop, one that neuer in his life
3796   Felt so much cold, as ouer shooes in Snow:
3797   Let's whip these straglers o're the Seas againe,
3798   Lash hence these ouer- weening Ragges of France,
3799   These famish'd Beggers, weary of their liues,
3800   Who (but for dreaming on this fond exploit)
3801  *For want of meanes (poore Rats) had hang'd themselues.
3802   If we be conquered, let men conquer vs,
3803   And not these bastard Britaines, whom our Fathers
3804   Haue in their owne Land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
3805   And on Record, left them the heires of shame.
3806   Shall these enioy our Lands? lye with our Wiues?
3807   Rauish our daughters?  <D {Drum afarre off}>
3808   Hearke, I heare their Drumme,
3809   Right Gentlemen of England, fight boldly yeomen,
3810   Draw Archers draw your Arrowes to the head,
3811   Spurre your proud Horses hard, and ride in blood,
3812   Amaze the welkin with your broken staues.
3813   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
3814   What sayes Lord {Stanley}, will he bring his power?
3815   <S {Mes}.> My Lord, he doth deny to come.
3816   <S {King}.> Off with his sonne {Georges} head.
3817   <S {Nor}.> My Lord, the Enemy is past the Marsh:
3818   After the battaile, let {George Stanley} dye.
3819  *<S {King}.> A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
3820   Aduance our Standards, set vpon our Foes,
3821   Our Ancient word of Courage, faire S[aint]. {George}
3822   Inspire vs with the spleene of fiery Dragons:
3823   Vpon them, Victorie sits on our helpes.
3824   <D {Alarum, excursions. Enter Catesby}.>
3825   <S {Cat}.> Rescue my Lord of Norfolke,
3826   Rescue, Rescue:
3827   The King enacts more wonders then a man,
3828   Daring an opposite to euery danger:
3829   His horse is slaine, and all on foot he fights,
3830   Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death:
3831   Rescue faire Lord, or else the day is lost.
3832   <D {Alarums}.>
      <P t2v>
3833   <D {Enter Richard}.>
3834   <S {Rich}.> A Horse, a Horse, my Kingdome for a Horse.
3835  *<S {Cates}.> Withdraw my Lord, Ile helpe you to a Horse
3836   <S {Rich}.> Slaue, I haue set my life vpon a cast,
3837   And I will stand the hazard of the Dye:
3838   I thinke there be sixe Richmonds in the field,
3839   Fiue haue I slaine to day, in stead of him.
3840   A Horse, a Horse, my Kingdome for a Horse.
3841  *<D {Alarum, Enter Richard and Richmond, they fight, Richard}
3842   {is slaine}.>
3843  *<D {Retreat, and Flourish. Enter Richmond, Derby bearing the}
3844   {Crowne, with diuers other Lords}.>
3845   <S {Richm}.> God, and your Armes
3846   Be prais'd Victorious Friends;
3847   The day is ours, the bloudy Dogge is dead.
3848   <S {Der}.> Couragious Richmond,
3849   Well hast thou acquit thee: Loe,
3850   Heere these long vsurped Royalties,
3851   From the dead Temples of this bloudy Wretch,
3852   Haue I pluck'd off, to grace thy Browes withall.
3853   Weare it, and make much of it.
3854   <S {Richm}.> Great God of Heauen, say Amen to all.
3855   But tell me, is yong {George Stanley} liuing?
3856   <S {Der}.> He is my Lord, and safe in Leicester Towne,
3857   Whither (if you please) we may withdraw vs.
3858   <S {Richm}.> What men of name are slaine on either side?
3859   <S {Der}.> {Iohn} Duke of Norfolke, {Walter} Lord Ferris,
3860   Sir {Robert Brokenbury}, and Sir {William Brandon}.
3861  *<S {Richm}.> Interre their Bodies, as become their Births,
3862   Proclaime a pardon to the Soldiers fled,
3863   That in submission will returne to vs,
3864   And then as we haue tane the Sacrament,
3865   We will vnite the White Rose, and the Red.
3866   Smile Heauen vpon this faire Coniunction,
3867   That long haue frown'd vpon their Enmity:
3868   What Traitor heares me, and sayes not Amen?
3869   England hath long beene mad, and scarr'd her selfe;
3870   The Brother blindely shed the Brothers blood;
3871   The Father, rashly slaughtered his owne Sonne;
3872   The Sonne compell'd, beene Butcher to the Sire;
3873   All this diuided Yorke and Lancaster,
3874   Diuided, in their dire Diuision.
3875   O now, let {Richmond} and {Elizabeth},
3876   The true Succeeders of each Royall House,
3877   By Gods faire ordinance, conioyne together:
3878   And let thy Heires (God if thy #will be so)
3879   Enrich the time to come, with Smooth- fac'd Peace,
3880   With smiling Plenty, and faire Prosperous dayes.
3881   Abate the edge of Traitors, Gracious Lord,
3882   That would reduce these bloudy dayes againe,
3883   And make poore England weepe in Streames of Blood;
3884   Let them not liue to taste this Lands increase,
3885  *That would with Treason, wound this faire Lands peace.
3886   Now Ciuill wounds are stopp'd, Peace liues agen;
3887   That she may long liue heere, God say, Amen.  <D {Exeunt}>
