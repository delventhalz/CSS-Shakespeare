2     *<D {Enter yong Bertram Count of Rossillion, his Mother, and}
3      {Helena, Lord Lafew, all in blacke}.>
4      <S {Mother}.>
5     *In deliuering my sonne from me, I burie a se-cond
6      husband.
7     *<S {Ros}.> And I in going Madam, weep ore my
8     *fathers death anew; but I must attend his maie-sties
9     *command, to whom I am now in Ward, euermore
10     in subiection.
11    *<S {Laf}.> You shall find of the King a husband Madame,
12    *you sir a father. He that so generally is at all times good,
13    *must of necessitie hold his vertue to you, whose worthi-nesse
14    *would stirre it vp where it wanted rather then lack
15     it where there is such abundance.
16    *<S {Mo}.> What hope is there of his Maiesties amendment?
17    *<S {Laf}.> He hath abandon'd his Phisitions Madam, vn-der
18    *whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope,
19    *and finds no other aduantage in the processe, but onely
20     the loosing of hope by time.
21    *<S {Mo}.> This yong Gentlewoman #had a father, O that
22    *#had, how sad a passage tis, whose skill was almost as
23    *great as his honestie, had it stretch'd so far, would haue
24    *made nature immortall, and death should haue play for
25    *lacke of worke. Would for the Kings sake hee were li-uing,
26    *I thinke it would be the death of the Kings disease.
27    *<S {Laf}.> How call'd you the man you speake of Madam?
28    *<S {Mo}.> He was famous sir in his profession, and it was
29     his great right to be so: {Gerard de Narbon}.
30    *<S {Laf}.> He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very
31    *latelie spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee
32    *was skilfull enough to haue liu'd stil, if knowledge could
33     be set vp against mortallitie.
34    *<S {Ros}.> What is it (my good Lord) the King languishes
35     of?
36     <S {Laf}.> A Fistula my Lord.
37     <S {Ros}.> I heard not of it before.
38    *<S {Laf}.> I would it were not notorious. Was this Gen-tlewoman
39     the Daughter of {Gerard de Narbon}?
40    *<S {Mo}.> His sole childe my Lord, and bequeathed  to my
41    *ouer looking. I haue those hopes of her good, that her
42    *education promises her dispositions shee inherits, which
43    *makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind car-ries
44    *vertuous qualities, there commendations go with
45    *pitty, they are vertues and traitors too: in her they are
46    *the better for their simplenesse; she deriues her honestie,
47     and atcheeues her goodnesse.
48    *<S {Lafew}.> Your commendations Madam get from her
49     teares.
50    *<S {Mo}.> 'Tis the best brine a Maiden can season her praise
51    *in. The remembrance of her father neuer approches her
52    *heart, but the tirrany of her sorrowes takes all liuelihood
53    *from her cheeke. No more of this {Helena}, go #too, no
54    *more least it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, then
55     to haue===
56    *<S {Hell}.> I doe affect a sorrow indeed, but I haue it too.
57    *<S {Laf}.> Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
58     excessiue greefe the enemie to the liuing.
59    *<S {Mo}.> If the liuing be enemie to the greefe, the excesse
60     makes it soone mortall.
61     <S {Ros}.> Maddam I desire your holie wishes.
62     <S {Laf}.> How vnderstand we that?
63     <S {Mo}.> Be thou blest {Bertrame}, and succeed thy father
64     In manners as in shape: thy blood and vertue
65     Contend for Empire in thee, and thy goodnesse
66     Share with thy birth- right. Loue all, trust a few,
67     Doe wrong to none: be able for thine enemie
68     Rather in power then vse: and keepe thy friend
69     Vnder thy owne lifes key. Be checkt for silence,
70     But neuer tax'd for speech. What heauen more wil,
71     That thee may furnish, and my prayers plucke downe,
72     Fall on thy head. Farwell my Lord,
73     'Tis an vnseason'd Courtier, good my Lord
74     Aduise him.
75     <S {Laf}.> He cannot want the best
76     That shall attend his loue.
77     <S {Mo}.> Heauen blesse him: Farwell {Bertram}.
78    *<S {Ro}.> The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoghts
79    *be seruants to you: be comfortable to my mother, your
80     Mistris, and make much of her.
81    *<S {Laf}.> Farewell prettie Lady, you must hold the cre-dit
82     of your father.
83     <S {Hell}.> O were that all, I thinke not on my father,
84     And these great teares grace his remembrance more
85     Then those I shed for him. What was he like?
86     I haue forgott him. My imagination
87     Carries no fauour in't but {Bertrams}.
88     I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,
89     If {Bertram} be away. 'Twere all one,
90     That I should loue a bright particuler starre,
91     And think to wed it, he is so aboue me
92     In his bright radience and colaterall light,
      <P V2>
93     Must I be comforted, not in his sphere;
94     Th' ambition  in my loue thus plagues it selfe:
95     The hind that would be mated by the Lion
96     Must die for loue. 'Twas prettie, though a plague
97     To see him euerie houre to sit and draw
98     His arched browes, his hawking eie, his curles
99     In our hearts table: heart too capeable
100    Of euerie line and tricke of his sweet fauour.
101    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancie
102    Must sanctifie his Reliques. Who comes heere?
103    <D {Enter Parrolles}.>
104    One that goes with him: I loue him for his sake,
105    And yet I know him a notorious Liar,
106    Thinke him a great way foole, solie a coward,
107    Yet these fixt euils sit so fit in him,
108    That they take place, when Vertues steely bones
109    Lookes bleake i'th cold wind: withall, full ofte we see
110    Cold wisedome waighting on superfluous follie.
111    <S {Par}.> Saue you faire Queene.
112    <S {Hel}.> And you Monarch.
113    <S {Par}.> No.
114    <S {Hel}.> And no.
115    <S {Par}.> Are you meditating on virginitie?
116   *<S {Hel}.> #I: you haue some staine of souldier in you: Let
117   *mee aske you a question. Man is enemie to virginitie,
118    how may we barracado it against him?
119    <S {Par}.> Keepe him out.
120   *<S {Hel}.> But he assailes, and our virginitie though vali-ant,
121   *in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs some war- like
122    resistance.
123   *<S {Par}.> There is none: Man setting downe before you,
124    will vndermine you, and blow you vp.
125   *<S {Hel}.> Blesse our poore Virginity from vnderminers
126   *and blowers vp. Is there no Military policy how Vir-gins
127    might blow vp men?
128   *<S {Par}.> Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will
129   *quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe
130   *againe, with the breach your selues made, you lose your
131   *Citty. It is not politicke, in the Common- wealth of
132   *Nature, to preserue virginity. Losse of Virginitie, is
133   *rationall encrease, and there was neuer Virgin goe, till
134   *virginitie was first lost. That you were made of, is met-tall
135   *to make Virgins. Virginitie, by beeing once lost,
136   *may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer
137    lost: 'tis too cold a companion: Away with't.
138   *<S {Hel}.> I will stand for't a little, though therefore I die
139    a Virgin.
140   *<S {Par}.> There's little can bee saide in't, 'tis against the
141   *rule of Nature. To speake on the part of virginitie, is
142   *to accuse your Mothers; which is most infallible diso-bedience.
143   *He that hangs himselfe is a Virgin: Virgini-tie
144   *murthers it selfe, and should be buried in highwayes
145   *out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate Offendresse a-gainst
146   *Nature. Virginitie breedes mites, much like a
147   *Cheese, consumes it selfe to the very payring, and so
148   *dies with feeding his owne stomacke. Besides, Virgini-tie
149   *is peeuish, proud, ydle, made of selfe- loue, which
150   *is the most inhibited sinne in the Cannon. Keepe it not,
151   *you cannot choose but loose by't. Out with't: within
152   *ten yeare it will make it selfe two, which is a goodly in-crease,
153   *and the principall it selfe not much the worse.
154    Away with't.
155   *<S {Hel}.> How might one do sir, to loose it to her owne
156    liking?
157   *<S {Par}.> Let mee see. Marry #ill, to like him that ne're
158   *it likes. 'Tis a commodity wil lose the glosse with lying:
159   *The longer kept, the lesse worth: Off with't while 'tis
160   *vendible. Answer the time of request, Virginitie like
161   *an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fashion, richly
162   *suted, but vnsuteable, iust like the brooch & the tooth- pick,
163   *which were not now: your Date is better in your
164   *Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your
165   *virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French
166   *wither'd peares, it lookes #ill, it eates drily, marry 'tis a
167   *wither'd peare: it was formerly better, marry yet 'tis a
168    wither'd peare: Will you any thing with it?
169    <S {Hel}.> Not my virginity yet:
170    There shall your Master haue a thousand loues,
171    A Mother, and a Mistresse, and a friend,
172    A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,
173    A guide, a Goddesse, and a Soueraigne,
174    A Counsellor, a Traitoresse, and a Deare:
175    His humble ambition, proud humility:
176    His iarring, concord: and his discord, dulcet:
177    His faith, his sweet disaster: with a world
178    Of pretty fond adoptious christendomes
179    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he:
180    I know not what he shall, God send him well,
181    The Courts a learning place, and he is one.
182    <S {Par}.> What one ifaith?
183    <S {Hel}.> That I wish well, 'tis pitty.
184    <S {Par}.> What's pitty?
185    <S {Hel}.> That wishing well had not a body in't,
186    Which might be felt, that we the poorer borne,
187    Whose baser starres do shut vs vp in wishes,
188    Might with effects of them follow our friends,
189    And shew what we alone must thinke, which neuer
190    Returnes vs thankes.
191    <D {Enter Page}.>
192    <S {Pag}.> Monsieur {Parrolles},
193    My Lord cals for you.
194   *<S {Par}.> Little {Hellen} farewell, if I can remember thee, I
195    will thinke of thee at Court.
196    <S {Hel}.> Monsieur {Parolles}, you were borne vnder a
197    charitable starre.
198    <S {Par}.> Vnder {Mars} I.
199    <S {Hel}.> I especially thinke, vnder {Mars}.
200    <S {Par}.> Why vnder {Mars}?
201    <S {Hel}.> The warres hath so kept you vnder, that you
202    must needes be borne vnder {Mars}.
203    <S {Par}.> When he was predominant.
204    <S {Hel}.> When he was retrograde I thinke rather.
205    <S {Par}.> Why thinke you so?
206    <S {Hel}.> You go so much backward when you fight.
207    <S {Par}.> That's for aduantage.
208    <S {Hel}.> So is running away,
209    When feare proposes the safetie:
210   *But the composition that your valour and feare makes
211   *in you, is a vertue of a good wing, and I like the
212    weare well.
213   *<S {Paroll}.> I am so full of businesses, I cannot answere
214   *thee acutely: I will returne perfect Courtier, in the
215   *which my instruction shall serue to naturalize thee, so
216   *thou wilt be capeable of a Courtiers councell, and vn-derstand
217   *what aduice shall thrust vppon thee, else thou
218   *diest in thine vnthankfulnes, and thine ignorance makes
219   *thee away, farewell: When thou hast leysure, say thy
220   *praiers: when thou hast none, remember thy Friends:
      <P V2v>
221   *Get thee a good husband, and vse him as he vses thee:
222    So farewell.
223    <S {Hel}.> Our remedies oft in our selues do lye,
224    Which we ascribe to heauen: the fated skye
225    Giues vs free scope, onely doth backward pull
226    Our slow designes, when we our selues are dull.
227    What power is it, which mounts my loue so hye,
228    That makes me see, and cannot feede mine eye?
229    The mightiest space in fortune, Nature brings
230    To ioyne like, likes; and kisse like natiue things.
231    Impossible be strange attempts to those
232    That weigh their paines in sence, and do suppose
233    What hath beene, cannot be. Who euer stroue
234    To shew her merit, that did misse her loue?
235    (The Kings disease) my proiect may deceiue me,
236    But my intents are fixt, and will not leaue me.  <D {Exit}>
237    <D {Flourish Cornets}.
238    {Enter the King of France with Letters, and}
239    {diuers Attendants}.>
240    <S {King}.> The {Florentines} and {Senoys} are by th' eares,
241    Haue fought with equall fortune, and continue
242    A brauing warre.
243    <S 1.{Lo.G}.> So tis reported sir.
244    <S {King}.> Nay tis most credible, we heere receiue it,
245    A certaintie vouch'd from our Cosin {Austria},
246    With caution, that the {Florentine} will moue vs
247    For speedie ayde: wherein our deerest friend
248    Preiudicates the businesse, and would seeme
249    To haue vs make deniall.
250    <S 1.{Lo.G}.> His loue and wisedome
251    Approu'd so to your Maiesty, may pleade
252    For amplest credence.
253    <S {King}.> He hath arm'd our answer,
254    And {Florence} is deni'de before he comes:
255    Yet for our Gentlemen that meane to see
256    The {Tuscan} seruice, freely haue they leaue
257    To stand on either part.
258    <S 2.{Lo.E}.> It well may serue
259    A nursserie to our Gentrie, who are sicke
260    For breathing, and exploit.
261    <S {King}.> What's he comes heere.
262    <D {Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles}.>
263    <S 1.{Lor.G}.> It is the Count {Rosignoll} my good Lord,
264    Yong {Bertram}.
265    <S {King}.> Youth, thou bear'st thy Fathers face,
266    Franke Nature rather curious then in #hast
267    Hath well compos'd thee: Thy Fathers morall parts
268    Maist thou inherit too: Welcome to {Paris}.
269    <S {Ber}.> My thankes and dutie are your Maiesties.
270    <S {Kin}.> I would I had that corporall soundnesse now,
271    As when thy father, and my selfe, in friendship
272    First tride our souldiership: he did looke farre
273    Into the seruice of the time, and was
274    Discipled of the brauest. He lasted long,
275    But on vs both did haggish Age steale on,
276    And wore vs out of act: It much repaires me
277    To talke of your good father; in his youth
278    He had the wit, which I can well obserue
279    To day in our yong Lords: but they may iest
280    Till their owne scorne returne to them vnnoted
281    Ere they can hide their leuitie in honour:
282    So like a Courtier, contempt nor bitternesse
283    Were in his pride, or sharpnesse; if they were,
284    His equall had awak'd them, and his honour
285    Clocke to it selfe, knew the true minute when
286    Exception bid him speake: and at this time
287    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him,
288    He vs'd as creatures of another place,
289    And bow'd his eminent top to their low rankes,
290    Making them proud of his humilitie,
291    In their poore praise he humbled: Such a man
292    Might be a copie to these yonger times;
293    Which followed well, would demonstrate them now
294    But goers backward.
295    <S {Ber}.> His good remembrance sir
296    Lies richer in your thoughts, then on his tombe:
297    So in approofe liues not his Epitaph,
298    As in your royall speech.
299   *<S {King}.> Would I were with him he would alwaies say,
300    (Me thinkes I heare him now) his plausiue words
301    He scatter'd not in eares, but grafted them
302    To grow there and to beare: Let me not liue,
303    This his good melancholly oft began
304    On the Catastrophe and #heele of pastime
305    When it was out: Let me not liue (quoth hee)
306    After my flame lackes oyle, to be the snuffe
307    Of yonger spirits, whose apprehensiue senses
308    All but new things disdaine; whose iudgements are
309    Meere fathers of their garments: whose constancies
310    Expire before their fashions: this he wish'd.
311    I after him, do after him wish too:
312    Since I nor wax nor honie can bring home,
313    I quickly were dissolued from my hiue
314    To giue some Labourers roome.
315    <S 2.{L.E}.> #You'r loued Sir,
316    They that least lend it you, shall lacke you first.
317    <S {Kin}.> I fill a place I know't: how long ist Count
318    Since the Physitian at your fathers died?
319    He was much fam'd.
320    <S {Ber}.> Some six moneths since my Lord.
321    <S {Kin}.> If he were liuing, I would try him yet.
322    Lend me an arme: the rest haue worne me out
323    With seuerall applications: Nature and sicknesse
324    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome Count,
325    My sonne's no deerer.
326    <S {Ber}.> Thanke your Maiesty.  <D {Exit}>
327    <D {Flourish}.>
328    <D {Enter Countesse, Steward, and Clowne}.>
329   *<S {Coun}.> I will now heare, what say you of this gentle-woman.
330   _
331   *<S {Ste}.> Maddam the care I haue had to euen your con-tent,
332   *I wish might be found in the Kalender of my past
333   *endeuours, for then we wound our Modestie, and make
334   *foule the clearnesse of our deseruings, when of our selues
335    we publish them.
336   *<S {Coun}.> What doe's this knaue heere? Get you gone
337   *sirra: the complaints I haue heard of you I do not all be-leeue,
338   *'tis my slownesse that I doe not: For I know you
339   *lacke not folly to commit them, & haue abilitie enough
340    to make such knaueries yours.
341   *<S {Clo}.> 'Tis not vnknown to you Madam, I am a poore
342    fellow.
343    <S {Coun}.> Well sir.
344    <S {Clo}.> No maddam,
345   *'Tis not so well that I am poore, though manie
      <P V3><C D>
346   *of the rich are damn'd, but if I may haue your Ladiships
347   *good #will to goe to the world, {Isbell} the woman and I
348    will doe as we may.
349    <S {Coun}.> Wilt thou needes be a begger?
350    <S {Clo}.> I doe beg your good #will in this case.
351    <S {Cou}.> In what case?
352   *<S {Clo}.> In {Isbels} case and mine owne: seruice is no heri-tage,
353   *and I thinke I shall neuer haue the blessing of God,
354   *till I haue issue #a my bodie: for they say barnes are bles-sings.
355   _
356    <S {Cou}.> Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marrie?
357   *<S {Clo}.> My poore bodie Madam requires it, I am driuen
358   *on by the flesh, and hee must needes goe that the diuell
359    driues.
360    <S {Cou}.> Is this all your worships reason?
361   *<S {Clo}.> Faith Madam I haue other holie reasons, such as
362    they are.
363    <S {Cou}.> May the world know them?
364   *<S {Clo}.> I haue beene Madam a wicked creature, as you
365   *and all flesh and blood are, and indeede I doe marrie that
366    I may repent.
367    <S {Cou}.> Thy marriage sooner then thy wickednesse.
368   *<S {Clo}.> I am out #a friends Madam, and I hope to haue
369    friends for my wiues sake.
370    <S {Cou}.> Such friends are thine enemies knaue.
371   *<S {Clo}.> Y'are  shallow Madam in great friends, for the
372   *knaues come to doe that for me which I am #a wearie of:
373   *he that eres my Land, spares my teame, and giues mee
374   *leaue to Inne the crop: if I be his cuckold hee's my
375   *drudge; he that comforts my wife, is the cherisher of
376   *my flesh and blood; hee that cherishes my flesh and
377   *blood, loues my flesh and blood; he that loues my flesh
378   *and blood is my friend: {ergo}, he that kisses my wife is my
379   *friend: if men could be contented to be what they are,
380   *there were no feare in marriage, for yong {Charbon} the
381   *Puritan, and old {Poysam} the Papist, how somere their
382   *hearts are seuer'd in Religion, their heads are both one,
383   *they may ioule horns together like any Deare i'th Herd.
384   *<S {Cou}.> Wilt thou euer be a foule mouth'd and calum-nious
385    knaue?
386   *<S {Clo}.> A Prophet I Madam, and I speake the truth the
387   *next waie, for I the Ballad will repeate, which men full
388   *true shall finde, your marriage comes by destinie, your
389    Cuckow sings by kinde.
390   *<S {Cou}.> Get you gone sir, Ile talke with you more anon.
391   *<S {Stew}.> May it please you Madam, that hee bid {Hellen}
392    come to you, of her I am to speake.
393   *<S {Cou}.> Sirra tell my gentlewoman I would speake with
394    her, {Hellen} I meane.
395    <S {Clo}.> Was this faire face the cause, quoth she,
396    Why the Grecians sacked {Troy},
397    Fond done, done, fond was this King {Priams} ioy,
398    With that she sighed as she stood, <D {bis}>
399   *And gaue this sentence then, among nine bad if one be
400   *good, among nine bad if one be good, there's yet one
401    good in ten.
402   *<S {Cou}.> What, one good in tenne? you corrupt the song
403    sirra.
404   *<S {Clo}.> One good woman in ten Madam, which is a pu-rifying
405   *ath' song: would God would serue the world so
406   *all the yeere, weed finde no fault with the tithe woman
407   *if I were the Parson, one in ten quoth #a? #and wee might
408   *haue a good woman borne but ore euerie blazing starre,
409   *or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the Lotterie well, a
410    man may draw his heart out ere #a plucke one.
411   *<S {Cou}.> Youle begone sir knaue, and doe as I command
412    you?
413   *<S {Clo}.> That man should be at womans command, and
414   *yet no hurt done, though honestie be no Puritan, yet
415   *it will doe no hurt, it will weare the Surplis of humilitie
416   *ouer the blacke- Gowne of a bigge heart: I am go-ing
417    forsooth, the businesse is for {Helen} to come hither.
418    <D {Exit}.>
419    <S {Cou}.> Well now.
420   *<S {Stew}.> I know Madam you loue your Gentlewoman
421    intirely.
422   *<S {Cou}.> Faith I doe: her Father bequeath'd her to mee,
423   *and she her selfe without other aduantage, may lawful-lie
424   *make title to as much loue as shee findes, there is
425   *more owing her then is paid, and more shall be paid
426    her then sheele demand.
427   *<S {Stew}.> Madam, I was verie late more neere her then
428   *I thinke shee wisht mee, alone shee was, and did
429   *communicate to her selfe her owne words to her
430   *owne eares, shee thought, I dare vowe for her, they
431   *toucht not anie stranger sence, her matter was, shee
432   *loued your Sonne; Fortune shee said was no god-desse,
433   *that had put such difference betwixt their two
434   *estates: Loue no god, that would not extend his #might
435   *onelie, where qualities were leuell, Queene of Vir-gins,
436   *that would suffer her poore Knight surpris'd
437   *without rescue in the first assault or ransome after-ward:
438   *This shee deliuer'd in the most bitter touch of
439   *sorrow that ere I heard Virgin exclaime in, which I held
440   *my dutie speedily to acquaint you withall, sithence in
441   *the losse that may happen, it concernes you something
442    to know it.
443   *<S {Cou}.> You haue discharg'd this honestlie, keepe it
444   *to your selfe, manie likelihoods inform'd mee of this
445   *before, which hung so tottring in the ballance, that
446   *I could neither beleeue nor misdoubt: praie you
447   *leaue mee, stall this in your bosome, and I thanke
448   *you for your honest care: I will speake with you fur-ther
449    anon.  <D {Exit Steward}.>
450    <D {Enter Hellen}.>
451   *<S {Old.Cou}.> Euen so it was with me when I was yong:
452    If euer we are natures, these are ours, this thorne
453    Doth to our Rose of youth rightlie belong
454    Our bloud to vs, this to our blood is borne,
455    It is the show, and seale of natures truth,
456    Where loues strong passion is imprest in youth,
457    By our remembrances of daies forgon,
458    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none,
459    Her eie is sicke on't, I obserue her now.
460    <S {Hell}.> What is your pleasure Madam?
461    <S {Ol.Cou}.> You know {Hellen} I am a mother to you.
462    <S {Hell}.> Mine honorable Mistris.
463   *<S {Ol.Cou}.> Nay a mother, why not a mother? when I
464    sed a mother
465    Me thought you saw a serpent, what's in mother,
466    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
467    And put you in the Catalogue of those
468    That were enwombed mine, 'tis often seene
469    Adoption striues with nature, and choise breedes
470    A natiue slip to vs from forraine seedes:
471    You nere opprest me with a mothers groane,
472    Yet I expresse to you a mothers care,
473    (Gods mercie maiden) dos it curd thy blood
474    To say I am thy mother? what's the matter,
475    That this distempered messenger of wet?
      <P V3v>
476    The manie colour'd Iris rounds thine eye?
477    === Why, that you are my daughter?
478    <S {Hell}.> That I am not.
479    <S {Old.Cou}.> I say I am your Mother.
480    <S {Hell}.> Pardon Madam.
481    The Count {Rosillion} cannot be my brother:
482    I am from humble, he from honored name:
483    No note vpon my Parents, his all noble,
484    My Master, my deere Lord he is, and I
485    His seruant liue, and will his vassall die:
486    He must not be my brother.
487    <S {Ol.Cou}.> Nor I your Mother.
488    <S {Hell}.> You are my mother Madam, would you were
489    So that my Lord your sonne were not my brother,
490    Indeede my mother, or were you both our mothers,
491    I care no more for, then I doe for heauen,
492    So I were not his sister, cant no other,
493    But I your daughter, he must be my brother.
494   *<S {Old.Cou}.> Yes {Hellen}, you might be my daughter in law,
495    God shield you meane it not, daughter and mother
496    So striue vpon your pulse; what pale agen?
497    My feare hath catcht your fondnesse! now I see
498    The mistrie of your louelinesse, and finde
499    Your salt teares head, now to all sence 'tis grosse:
500    You loue my sonne, inuention is asham'd
501    Against the proclamation of thy passion
502    To say thou doost not: therefore tell me true,
503    But tell me then 'tis so, for looke, thy cheekes
504    Confesse it 'ton tooth to th' other,  and thine eies
505    See it so grosely showne in thy behauiours,
506    That in their kinde they speake it, onely sinne
507    And hellish obstinacie tye thy tongue
508    That truth should be suspected, speake, ist so?
509    If it be so, you haue wound a goodly clewe:
510    If it be not, forsweare't how ere I charge thee,
511    As heauen shall worke in me for thine auaile
512    To tell me truelie.
513    <S {Hell}.> Good Madam pardon me.
514    <S {Cou}.> Do you loue my Sonne?
515    <S {Hell}.> Your pardon noble Mistris.
516    <S {Cou}.> Loue you my Sonne?
517    <S {Hell}.> Doe not you loue him Madam?
518    <S {Cou}.> Goe not about; my loue hath in't a bond
519   *Whereof the world takes note: Come, come, disclose:
520    The state of your affection, for your passions
521    Haue to the full appeach'd.
522    <S {Hell}.> Then I confesse
523    Here on my knee, before high heauen and you,
524   *That before you, and next vnto high heauen, I loue your
525    Sonne:
526    My friends were poore but honest, so's my loue:
527    Be not offended, for it hurts not him
528    That he is lou'd of me; I follow him not
529    By any token of presumptuous suite,
530    Nor would I haue him, till I doe deserue him,
531    Yet neuer know how that desert should be:
532    I know I loue in vaine, striue against hope:
533    Yet in this captious, and intemible Siue.
534    I still poure in the waters of my loue
535    And lacke not to loose still; thus {Indian} like
536    Religious in mine error, I adore
537    The Sunne that lookes vpon his worshipper,
538    But knowes of him no more. My deerest Madam,
539    Let not your hate incounter with my loue,
540    For louing where you doe; but if your selfe,
541    Whose aged honor cites a vertuous youth,
542    Did euer, in so true a flame of liking,
543    Wish chastly, and loue dearely, that your {Dian}
544    Was both her selfe and loue, O then giue pittie
545    To her whose state is such, that cannot choose
546    But lend and giue where she is sure to loose;
547    That seekes not to finde that, her search implies,
548    But riddle like, liues sweetely where she dies.
549    <S {Cou}.> Had you not lately an intent, speake truely,
550    To goe to {Paris}?
551    <S {Hell}.> Madam I had.
552    <S {Cou}.> Wherefore? tell true.
553    <S {Hell}.> I will tell truth, by grace it selfe I sweare:
554    You know my Father left me some prescriptions
555    Of rare and prou'd effects, such as his reading
556    And manifest experience, had collected
557    For generall soueraigntie: and that he wil'd me
558    In heedefull'st reseruation to bestow them,
559    As notes, whose faculties inclusiue were,
560    More then they were in note: Amongst the rest,
561    There is a remedie, approu'd, set downe,
562    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
563    The King is render'd lost.
564   *<S {Cou}.> This was your motiue for {Paris}, was it, speake?
565   *<S {Hell}.> My Lord, your sonne, made me to think of this;
566    Else {Paris}, and the medicine, and the King,
567    Had from the conuersation of my thoughts,
568    Happily beene absent then.
569    <S {Cou}.> But thinke you {Hellen},
570    If you should tender your supposed aide,
571    He would receiue it? He and his Phisitions
572    Are of a minde, he, that they cannot helpe him:
573    They, that they cannot helpe, how shall they credit
574    A poore vnlearned Virgin, when the Schooles
575    Embowel'd of their doctrine, haue left off
576    The danger to it selfe.
577    <S {Hell}.> There's something in't
578    More then my Fathers skill, which was the great'st
579    Of his profession, that his good receipt,
580    Shall for my legacie be sanctified
581    Byth' luckiest stars in heauen, and would your honor
582    But giue me leaue to trie successe, I'de venture
583    The well lost life of mine, on his Graces cure,
584    By such a day, an houre.
585    <S {Cou}.> Doo'st thou beleeue't?
586    <S {Hell}.> #I Madam knowingly.
587   *<S {Cou}.> Why {Hellen} thou shalt haue my leaue and loue,
588    Meanes and attendants, and my louing greetings
589    To those of mine in Court, Ile staie at home
590    And praie Gods blessing into thy attempt:
591    Begon to morrow, and be sure of this,
592    What I can helpe thee to, thou shalt not misse.  <D {Exeunt}.>
593    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
594    <D {Enter the King with diuers yong Lords, taking leaue for}
595    {the Florentine warre: Count, Rosse, and}
596    {Parrolles. Florish Cornets}.>
597   *<S {King}.> Farewell yong Lords, these warlike principles
598    Doe  not throw from you, and you my Lords farewell:
599    Share the aduice betwixt you, if both gaine, all
600    The guift doth stretch it selfe as 'tis receiu'd,
601    And is enough for both.
602    <S {Lord.G}.> 'Tis our hope sir,
      <P V4><C C>
603    After well entred souldiers, to returne
604    And finde your grace in health.
605    <S {King}.> No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
606    Will not confesse he owes the mallady
607    That doth my life besiege: farwell yong Lords,
608    Whether I liue or die, be you the sonnes
609    Of worthy French men: let higher Italy
610    (Those bated that inherit but the fall
611    Of the last Monarchy) see that you come
612    Not to wooe honour, but to wed it, when
613    The brauest questant shrinkes: finde what you seeke,
614    That fame may cry you loud: I say farewell.
615    <S {L.G}.> Health at your bidding serue your Maiesty.
616    <S {King}.> Those girles of Italy, take heed of them,
617    They say our French, lacke language to deny
618    If they demand: beware of being Captiues
619    Before you serue.
620    <S {Bo}.> Our hearts receiue your warnings.
621    <S {King}.> Farewell, come hether to me.
622   *<S 1.{Lo.G}.> Oh my sweet Lord y you wil stay behind vs.
623    <S {Parr}.> 'Tis not his fault the spark.
624    <S 2.{Lo.E}.> Oh 'tis braue warres.
625    <S {Parr}.> Most admirable, I haue seene those warres.
626   *<S {Rossill}.> I am commanded here, and kept a coyle with,
627    Too young, and the next yeere, and 'tis too early.
628    <S {Parr}.> #And thy minde stand too't boy,
629    Steale away brauely.
630    <S {Rossill}.> I shal stay here the for- horse to a smocke,
631    Creeking my shooes on the plaine Masonry,
632    Till honour be bought vp, and no sword worne
633    But one to dance with: by heauen, Ile steale away.
634    <S 1.{Lo.G}.> There's honour in the theft.
635    <S {Parr}.> Commit it Count.
636    <S 2.{Lo.E}.> I am your accessary, and so farewell.
637   *<S {Ros}.> I grow to you, & our parting is a tortur'd body.
638    <S 1.{Lo.G}.> Farewell Captaine.
639    <S 2.{Lo.E}.> Sweet Mounsier {Parolles}.
640   *<S {Parr}.> Noble {Heroes}; my sword and yours are kinne,
641   *good sparkes and lustrous, a word good mettals. You
642   *shall finde in the Regiment of the Spinij, one Captaine
643   *{Spurio} his sicatrice, with an Embleme of warre heere on
644   *his sinister cheeke; it was this very sword entrench'd it:
645    say to him I liue, and obserue his reports for me.
646    <S {Lo.G}.> We shall noble Captaine.
647   *<S {Parr}.> {Mars} doate on you for his nouices, what will
648    ye doe?
649    <S {Ross}.> Stay the King.
650   *<S {Parr}.> Vse a more spacious ceremonie to the Noble
651   *Lords, you haue restrain'd your selfe within the List of
652   *too cold an adieu: be more expressiue to them; for they
653   *weare themselues in the cap of the time, there do muster
654   *true gate; eat, speake, and moue vnder the influence of
655   *the most receiu'd starre, and though the deuill leade the
656   *measure, such are to be followed: after them, and take a
657    more dilated farewell.
658    <S {Ross}.> And I will doe so.
659   *<S {Parr}.> Worthy fellowes, and like to prooue most si-newie
660    sword- men.  <D {Exeunt}.>
661    <D {Enter Lafew}.>
662   *<S {L.Laf}.> Pardon my Lord for mee and for my tidings.
663    <S {King}.> Ile see thee to stand vp.
664   *<S {L.Laf}.> Then heres a man stands that has brought his |(pardon,
665    I would you had kneel'd my Lord to aske me mercy,
666    And that at my bidding you could so stand vp.
667    <S {King}.> I would I had, so I had broke thy pate
668    And askt thee mercy for't.
669   *<S {Laf}.> Goodfaith a- crosse, but my good Lord 'tis thus,
670    Will you be cur'd of your infirmitie?
671    <S {King}.> No.
672    <S {Laf}.> O will you eat no grapes my royall foxe?
673    Yes but you will, my noble grapes, #and if
674   *My royall foxe could reach them: I haue seen a medicine
675    That's able to breath life into a stone,
676    Quicken a rocke, and make you dance Canari
677    With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch
678    Is powerfull to arayse King {Pippen}, nay
679    To giue great {Charlemaine} a pen in's hand
680    And write to her a loue- line.
681    <S {King}.> What #her is this?
682   *<S {Laf}.> Why doctor #she: my Lord, there's one arriu'd,
683    If you will see her: now by my faith and honour,
684    If seriously I may conuay my thoughts
685    In this my light deliuerance, I haue spoke
686    With one, that in her sexe, her yeeres, profession,
687    Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz'd mee more
688    Then I dare blame my weakenesse: will you see her?
689    For that is her demand, and know her businesse?
690    That done, laugh well at me.
691    <S {King}.> Now good {Lafew},
692    Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
693    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
694    By wondring how thou tookst it.
695    <S {Laf}.> Nay, Ile fit you,
696    And not be all day neither.
697    <S {King}.> Thus he his speciall nothing euer prologues.
698    <S {Laf}.> Nay, come your waies.
699    <D {Enter Hellen}.>
700    <S {King}.> This haste hath wings indeed.
701    <S {Laf}.> Nay, come your waies,
702    This is his Maiestie, say your minde to him,
703    A Traitor you doe looke like, but such traitors
704    His Maiesty seldome feares, I am {Cresseds} Vncle,
705    That dare leaue two together, far you well.  <D {Exit}.>
706    <S {King}.> Now faire one, do's your busines follow vs?
707    <S {Hel}.> #I my good Lord,
708    {Gerard de Narbon} was my father,
709    In what he did professe, well found.
710    <S {King}.> I knew him.
711   *<S {Hel}.> The rather will I spare my praises towards him,
712    Knowing him is enough: on's bed of death,
713    Many receits he gaue me, chieflie one,
714    Which as the dearest issue of his practice
715    And of his olde experience, th' onlie  darling,
716    He bad me store vp, as a triple eye,
717    Safer then mine owne two: more deare I haue so,
718    And hearing your high Maiestie is toucht
719    With that malignant cause, wherein the honour
720    Of my deare fathers gift, stands cheefe in power,
721    I come to tender it, and my appliance,
722    With all bound humblenesse.
723    <S {King}.> We thanke you maiden,
724    But may not be so credulous of cure,
725    When our most learned Doctors leaue vs, and
726    The congregated Colledge haue concluded,
727    That labouring #Art can neuer ransome nature
728    From her inaydible estate: I say we must not
729    So staine our iudgement, or corrupt our hope,
730    To prostitute our past- cure malladie
731    To empericks, or to disseuer so
732    Our great selfe and our credit, to esteeme
733    A sencelesse helpe, when helpe past sence we deeme.
      <P V4v>
734    <S {Hell}.> My dutie then shall pay me for my paines:
735    I will no more enforce mine office on you,
736    Humbly intreating from your royall thoughts,
737    A modest one to beare me backe againe.
738    <S {King}.> I cannot giue thee lesse to be cal'd gratefull:
739    Thou thoughtst to helpe me, and such thankes I giue,
740    As one neere death to those that wish him liue:
741    But what at full I know, thou knowst no part,
742    I knowing all my perill, thou no #Art.
743    <S {Hell}.> What I can doe, can doe no hurt to try,
744    Since you set vp your rest 'gainst remedie:
745    He that of greatest workes is finisher,
746    Oft does them by the weakest minister:
747    So holy Writ, in babes hath iudgement showne,
748   *When Iudges haue bin babes; great flouds haue flowne
749    From simple  sources: and great Seas haue dried
750    When Miracles haue by the great'st beene denied.
751    Oft expectation failes, and most oft there
752    Where most it promises: and oft it hits,
753    Where hope is coldest, and despaire most shifts.
754   *<S {King}.> I must not heare thee, fare thee wel kind maide,
755    Thy paines not vs'd, must by thy selfe be paid,
756    Proffers not tooke, reape thanks for their reward.
757    <S {Hel}.> Inspired Merit so by breath is bard,
758    It is not so with him that all things knowes
759    As 'tis with vs, that square our guesse by showes:
760    But most it is presumption in vs, when
761    The help of heauen we count the act of men.
762    Deare sir, to my endeauors giue consent,
763    Of heauen, not me, make an experiment.
764    I am not an Imposture, that proclaime
765    My selfe against the leuill of mine aime,
766    But know I thinke, and thinke I know most sure,
767    My #Art is not past power, nor you past cure.
768    <S {King}.> Art thou so confident? Within what space
769    Hop'st thou my cure?
770    <S {Hel}.> The greatest grace lending grace,
771    Ere twice the horses of the sunne shall bring
772    Their fiery torcher his diurnall ring,
773    Ere twice in murke and occidentall dampe
774    Moist {Hesperus} hath quench'd her sleepy Lampe:
775    Or foure and twenty times the Pylots glasse
776    Hath told the theeuish minutes, how they passe:
777    What is infirme, from your sound parts shall flie,
778    Health shall liue free, and sickenesse freely dye.
779    <S {King}.> Vpon thy certainty and confidence,
780    What dar'st thou venter?
781    <S {Hell}.> Taxe of impudence,
782    A strumpets boldnesse, a divulged shame
783    Traduc'd by odious ballads: my maidens name
784    Seard otherwise, ne worse of worst extended
785    With vildest torture, let my life be ended.
786   *<S {Kin}.> Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
787    His powerfull sound, within an organ weake:
788    And what impossibility would slay
789    In common sence, sence saues another way:
790    Thy life is deere, for all that life can rate
791    Worth name of life, in thee hath estimate:
792    Youth, beauty, wisedome, courage, all
793    That happines and prime, can happy call:
794    Thou this to hazard, needs must intimate
795    Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate,
796    Sweet practiser, thy Physicke I will try,
797    That ministers thine owne death if I die.
798    <S {Hel}.> If I breake time, or flinch in property
799    Of what I spoke, vnpittied let me die,
800    And well deseru'd: not helping, death's my fee,
801    But if I helpe, what doe you promise me.
802    <S {Kin}.> Make thy demand.
803    <S {Hel}.> But will you make it euen?
804    <S {Kin}.> #I by my Scepter, and my hopes of helpe.
805   *<S {Hel}.> Then shalt thou giue me with thy kingly hand
806    What husband in thy power I will command:
807    Exempted be from me the arrogance
808    To choose from forth the royall bloud of France,
809    My low and humble name to propagate
810    With any branch or image of thy state:
811    But such a one thy vassall, whom I know
812    Is free for me to aske, thee to bestow.
813    <S {Kin}.> Heere is my hand, the premises obseru'd,
814    Thy #will by my performance shall be seru'd:
815    So make the choice of thy owne time, for I
816    Thy resolv'd Patient, on thee still relye:
817    More should I question thee, and more I must,
818    Though more to know, could not be more to trust:
819    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on, but rest
820    Vnquestion'd welcome, and vndoubted blest.
821    Giue me some helpe heere hoa, if thou proceed,
822    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
823    <D {Florish.  Exit}.>
824    <D {Enter Countesse and Clowne}.>
825   *<S {Lady}.> Come on sir, I shall  now put you to the height
826    of your breeding.
827   *<S {Clown}.> I will shew my selfe highly fed, and lowly
828    taught, I know my businesse is but to the Court.
829   *<S {Lady}.> To the Court, why what place make you spe-ciall,
830   *when you put off that with such contempt, but to
831    the Court?
832   *<S {Clo}.> Truly Madam, if God haue lent a man any man-ners,
833   *hee may easilie put it off at Court: hee that cannot
834   *make a legge, put off's cap, kisse his hand, and say no-thing,
835   *has neither legge, hands, lippe, nor cap; and in-deed
836   *such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
837    Court, but for me, I haue an answere will serue all men.
838   *<S {Lady}.> Marry that's a bountifull answere that fits all
839    questions.
840   *<S {Clo}.> It is like a Barbers chaire that fits all buttockes,
841   *the pin buttocke, the quatch- buttocke, the brawn but-tocke,
842    or any buttocke.
843    <S {Lady}.> Will your answere serue fit to all questions?
844   *<S {Clo}.> As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an Attur-ney,
845   *as your French Crowne for your taffety punke, as
846   *{Tibs} rush for {Toms} fore- finger, as a pancake for Shroue- tuesday,
847   *a Morris for May- day, as the naile to his hole,
848   *the Cuckold to his horne, as a scolding queane to a
849   *wrangling knaue, as the Nuns lip to the Friers mouth,
850    nay as the pudding to his skin.
851   *<S {Lady}.> Haue you, I say, an answere of such fitnesse for
852    all questions?
853   *<S {Clo}.> From below your Duke, to beneath your Con-stable,
854    it will fit any question.
855   *<S {Lady}.> It must be an answere of most monstrous size,
856    that must fit all demands.
857   *<S {Clo}.> But a triflle neither in good faith, if the learned
858   *should speake truth of it: heere it is, and all that belongs
859   *to't. Aske mee if I am a Courtier, it shall doe you no
860    harme to learne.
861   *<S {Lady}.> To be young againe if we could: I will bee a
862   *foole in question, hoping to bee the wiser by your an-swer.
863   _
      <P V5><C B>
864    <S {La}.> I pray you sir, are you a Courtier?
865   *<S {Clo}.> O Lord sir theres a simple putting off: more,
866    more, a hundred of them.
867   *<S {La}.> Sir I am a poore freind of yours, that loues you.
868    <S {Clo}.> O Lord sir, thicke, thicke, spare not me.
869   *<S {La}.> I thinke sir, you can eate none of this homely
870    meate.
871    <S {Clo}.> O Lord sir; nay put me too't, I warrant you.
872    <S {La}.> You were lately whipt sir as I thinke.
873    <S {Clo}.> O Lord sir, spare not me.
874   *<S {La}.> Doe you crie O Lord sir at your whipping, and
875   *spare not me? Indeed your O Lord sir, is very sequent
876   *to your whipping: you would answere very well to a
877    whipping if you were but bound too't.
878   *<S {Clo}.> I nere had worse lucke in my life in my O Lord
879    sir: I see things may serue long, but not serue euer.
880   *<S {La}.> I play the noble huswife with the time, to enter-taine
881    it so merrily with a foole.
882    <S {Clo}.> O Lord sir, why there't serues well agen.
883    <S {La}.> And end sir to your businesse: giue {Hellen} this,
884    And vrge her to a present answer backe,
885    Commend me to my kinsmen, and my sonne,
886    This is not much.
887    <S {Clo}.> Not much commendation to them.
888   *<S {La}.> Not much imployement for you, you vnder-stand
889    me.
890    <S {Clo}.> Most fruitfully, I am there, before my legges.
891    <S {La}.> #Hast you agen.  <D {Exeunt}>
892    <D {Enter Count, Lafew, and Parolles}.>
893   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> They say miracles are past, and we haue our
894   *Philosophicall persons, to make moderne and familiar
895   *things supernaturall and causelesse. Hence is it, that we
896   *make trifles of terrours, ensconcing our selues into see-ming
897   *knowledge, when we should submit our selues to
898    an vnknowne feare.
899   *<S {Par}.> Why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder, that
900    hath shot out in our latter times.
901    <S {Ros}.> And so 'tis.
902    <S {Ol.Laf}.> To be relinquisht of the Artists.
903    <S {Par}.> So I say both of {Galen} and {Paracelsus}.
904   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> Of all the learned and authenticke fellowes.
905    <S {Par}.> Right so I say.
906    <S {Ol.Laf}.> That gaue him out incureable.
907    <S {Par}.> Why there 'tis, so say I too.
908    <S {Ol.Laf}.> Not to be help'd.
909    <S {Par}.> Right, as 'twere a man assur'd of a===
910    <S {Ol.Laf}.> Vncertaine life, and sure death.
911    <S {Par}.> Iust, you say well: so would I haue said.
912   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> I may truly say, it is a noueltie to the world.
913   *<S {Par}.> It is indeede if you will haue it in shewing, you
914    shall reade it in what do ye call there.
915   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> A shewing of a heauenly effect in an earth-ly
916    Actor.
917    <S {Par}.> That's it, I would haue said, the verie same.
918   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> Why your Dolphin is not lustier: fore mee
919    I speake in respect===
920   *<S {Par}.> Nay 'tis strange, 'tis very straunge, that is the
921   *breefe and the tedious of it, and he's of a most facineri-ous
922    spirit, that will not acknowledge it to be the===
923    <S {Ol.Laf}.> Very hand of heauen.
924    <S {Par}.> #I, so I say.
925    <S {Ol.Laf}.> In a most weake===
926   *<S {Par}.> And debile minister great power, great tran-cendence,
927   *which should indeede giue vs a further vse to
928    be made, then alone the recou'ry of the king, as to bee
929    <S {Old} {Laf}.> Generally thankfull.
930    <D {Enter King, Hellen, and attendants}.>
931   *<S {Par}.> I would haue said it, you say well: heere comes
932    the King.
933   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> Lustique, as the Dutchman saies: Ile like a
934   *maide the Better whil'st I haue a tooth in my head: why
935    he's able to leade her a Carranto.
936    <S {Par}.> {Mor du vinager}, is not this {Helen}?
937    <S {Ol.Laf}.> Fore God I thinke so.
938    <S {King}.> Goe call before mee all the Lords in Court,
939    Sit my preseruer by thy patients side,
940    And with this healthfull hand whose banisht sence
941    Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receyue
942    The confirmation of my promis'd guift,
943    Which but attends thy naming.
944    <D {Enter} 3 {or} 4 {Lords}.>
945    Faire Maide send forth thine eye, this youthfull parcell
946    Of Noble Batchellors, stand at my bestowing,
947    Ore whom both Soueraigne power, and fathers voice
948    I haue to vse; thy franke election make,
949    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
950   *<S {Hel}.> To each of you, one faire and vertuous Mistris;
951    Fall when loue please, marry to each but one.
952    <S {Old} {Laf}.> I'de giue bay curtall, and his furniture
953    My mouth no more were broken then these boyes,
954    And writ as little beard.
955    <S {King}.> Peruse them well:
956    Not one of those, but had a Noble father.
957    <D {She addresses her to a Lord}.>
958   *<S {Hel}.> Gentlemen, heauen hath through me, restor'd
959    the king to health.
960    <S {All}.> We vnderstand it, and thanke heauen for you.
961    <S {Hel}.> I am a simple Maide, and therein wealthiest
962    That I protest, I simply am a Maide:
963    Please it your Maiestie, I haue done already:
964    The blushes in my cheekes thus whisper mee,
965    We blush that thou shouldst choose, but be refused;
966    Let the white death sit on thy cheeke for euer,
967    Wee'l nere come there againe.
968    <S {King}.> Make choise and see,
969    Who shuns thy loue, shuns all his loue in mee.
970    <S {Hel}.> Now {Dian} from thy Altar do I fly,
971    And to imperiall loue, that God most high
972    Do my sighes streame: Sir, wil you heare my suite?
973    <S 1.{Lo}.> And grant it.
974    <S {Hel}.> Thankes sir, all the rest is mute.
975    <S {Ol.Laf}.> I had rather be in this choise, then throw
976    Ames- ace for my life.
977    <S {Hel}.> The honor sir that flames in your faire eyes,
978    Before I speake too threatningly replies:
979    Loue make your fortunes twentie times aboue
980    Her that so wishes, and her humble loue.
981    <S 2.{Lo}.> No better if you please.
982    <S {Hel}.> My wish receiue,
983    Which great loue grant, and so I take my leaue.
984   *<S {Ol.Laf}.> Do all they denie her? #And they were sons
985   *of mine, I'de haue them whip'd, or I would send them
986    to'th Turke to make Eunuches of.
987    <S {Hel}.> Be not afraid that I your hand should take,
988    Ile neuer do you wrong for your owne sake:
989    Blessing vpon your vowes, and in your bed
990    Finde fairer fortune, if you euer wed.
991   *<S {Old} {Laf}.> These boyes are boyes of Ice, they'le none
      <P V5v>
992   *haue heere: sure they are bastards to the English, the
993    French nere got em.
994   *<S {La}.> You are too young, too happie, and too good
995    To make your selfe a sonne out of my blood.
996    <S 4.{Lord}.> Faire one, I thinke not so.
997   *<S {Ol.Lord}> There's one grape yet, I am sure thy father
998   *drunke wine. But if thou be'st not an asse, I am a youth
999    of fourteene: I haue knowne thee already.
1000   <S {Hel}.> I dare not say I take you, but I giue
1001   Me and my seruice, euer whilst I liue
1002   Into your guiding power: This is the man.
1003  *<S {King}.> Why then young {Bertram} take her shee's thy
1004   wife.
1005  *<S {Ber}.> My wife my Leige? I shal beseech your highnes
1006   In such a busines, giue me leaue to vse
1007   The helpe of mine owne eies.
1008   <S {King}.> Know'st thou not {Bertram} what shee ha's
1009   done for mee?
1010  *<S {Ber}.> Yes my good Lord, but neuer hope to know
1011   why I should marrie her.
1012  *<S {King}.> Thou know'st shee ha's rais'd me from my sick-ly
1013   bed.
1014   <S {Ber}.> But followes it my Lord, to bring me downe
1015   Must answer for your raising? I knowe her well:
1016   Shee had her breeding at my fathers charge:
1017   A poore Physitians daughter my wife? Disdaine
1018   Rather corrupt me euer.
1019  *<S {King}.> Tis onely title thou disdainst in her, the which
1020   I can build vp: strange is it that our bloods
1021   Of colour, waight, and heat, pour'd all together,
1022   Would quite confound distinction: yet stands off
1023   In differences so mightie. If she bee
1024   All that is vertuous (saue what thou dislik'st)
1025   A poore Phisitians daughter, thou dislik'st
1026   Of vertue for the name: but doe not so:
1027   From lowest place, whence vertuous things proceed,
1028   The place is dignified by th' doers deede.
1029   Where great additions swell's, and vertue none,
1030   It is a dropsied honour. Good alone,
1031   Is good without a name? Vilenesse is so:
1032   The propertie by what is is, should go,
1033   Not by the title. Shee is young, wise, faire,
1034   In these, to Nature shee's immediate heire:
1035   And these breed honour: that is honours scorne,
1036   Which challenges it selfe as honours borne,
1037   And is not like the sire: Honours thriue,
1038   When rather from our acts we them deriue
1039   Then our fore- goers: the meere words, a slaue
1040   Debosh'd on euerie tombe, on euerie graue:
1041   A lying Trophee, and as oft is dumbe,
1042   Where dust, and damn'd obliuion is the Tombe.
1043   Of honour'd bones indeed, what should be saide?
1044   If thou canst like this creature, as a maide,
1045   I can create the rest: Vertue, and shee
1046   Is her owne dower: Honour and wealth, from mee.
1047   <S {Ber}.> I cannot loue her, nor will striue to doo't.
1048  *<S {King}.> Thou wrong'st thy selfe, if thou shold'st striue
1049   to choose.
1050  *<S {Hel}.> That you are well restor'd my Lord, I'me glad:
1051   Let the rest go.
1052   <S {King}.> My Honor's at the stake, which to defeate
1053   I must produce my power. Heere, take her hand,
1054   Proud scornfull boy, vnworthie this good gift,
1055   That dost in vile misprision shackle vp
1056   My loue, and her desert: that canst not dreame,
1057   We poizing vs in her defectiue scale,
1058   Shall weigh thee to the beame: That wilt not know,
1059   It is in Vs to plant thine Honour, where
1060   We please to haue it grow. Checke thy contempt:
1061   Obey Our #will, which trauailes in thy good:
1062   Beleeue not thy disdaine, but presentlie
1063   Do thine owne fortunes that obedient right
1064   Which both thy dutie owes, and Our power claimes,
1065   Or I will throw thee from my care for euer
1066   Into the staggers, and the carelesse lapse
1067   Of youth and ignorance: both my reuenge and hate
1068   Loosing vpon thee, in the name of iustice,
1069   Without all termes of pittie. Speake, thine answer.
1070   <S {Ber}.> Pardon my gracious Lord: for I submit
1071   My fancie to your eies, when I consider
1072   What great creation, and what dole of honour
1073   Flies where you bid it: I finde that she which late
1074   Was in my Nobler thoughts, most base: is now
1075   The praised of the King, who so ennobled,
1076   Is as 'twere borne so.
1077   <S {King}.> Take her by the hand,
1078   And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
1079   A counterpoize: If not to thy estate,
1080   A ballance more repleat.
1081   <S {Ber}.> I take her hand.
1082   <S {Kin}.> Good fortune, and the fauour of the King
1083   Smile vpon this Contract: whose Ceremonie
1084   Shall seeme expedient on the now borne briefe,
1085   And be perform'd to night: the solemne Feast
1086   Shall more attend vpon the coming space,
1087   Expecting absent friends. As thou lou'st her,
1088   Thy loue's to me Religious: else, do's erre.  <D {Exeunt}>
1089   <D {Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commen-ting}
1090   {of this wedding}.>
1091   <S {Laf}.> Do you heare Monsieur? A word with you.
1092   <S {Par}.> Your pleasure sir.
1093  *<S {Laf}.> Your Lord and Master did well to make his re-cantation.
1094  _
1095   <S {Par}.> Recantation? My Lord? my Master?
1096   <S {Laf}.> #I: Is it not a Language I speake?
1097  *<S {Par}.> A most harsh one, and not to bee vnderstoode
1098   without bloudie succeeding. My Master?
1099   <S {Laf}.> Are you Companion to the Count {Rosillion}?
1100   <S {Par}.> To any Count, to all Counts: to what is man.
1101  *<S {Laf}.> To what is Counts man: Counts maister is of
1102   another stile.
1103  *<S {Par}.> You are too old sir: Let it satisfie you, you are
1104   too old.
1105  *<S {Laf}.> I must tell thee sirrah, I write Man: to which
1106   title age cannot bring thee.
1107   <S {Par}.> What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
1108  *<S {Laf}.> I did thinke thee for two ordinaries: to bee a
1109  *prettie wise fellow, thou didst make tollerable vent of
1110  *thy trauell, it might passe: yet the scarffes and the ban-nerets
1111  *about thee, did manifoldlie disswade me from be-leeuing
1112  *thee a vessell of too great a burthen. I haue now
1113  *found thee, when I loose thee againe, I care not: yet art
1114  *thou good for nothing but taking vp, and that th'ourt
1115   scarce worth.
1116  *<S {Par}.> Hadst thou not the priuiledge of Antiquity vp-on
1117   thee.
1118  *<S {Laf}.> Do not plundge thy selfe #to farre in anger, least
1119  *thou hasten thy triall: which if, Lord haue mercie on
1120  *thee for a hen, so my good window of Lettice fare thee
1121  *well, thy casement I neede not open, for I look through
1122   thee. Giue me thy hand.
1123  *<S {Par}.> My Lord, you giue me most egregious indignity.
      <P V6>
1124   <S {Laf}.> #I with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.
1125   <S {Par}.> I haue not my Lord deseru'd it.
1126  *<S {Laf}.> Yes good faith, eu'ry dramme of it, and I will
1127   not bate thee a scruple.
1128   <S {Par}.> Well, I shall be wiser.
1129  *<S {Laf}.> Eu'n as soone as thou can'st, for thou hast to pull
1130  *at a smacke a'th contrarie. If euer thou bee'st bound
1131  *in thy skarfe and beaten, thou shall finde what it is to be
1132  *proud of thy bondage, I haue a desire to holde my ac-quaintance
1133  *with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I
1134   may say in the default, he is a man I know.
1135  *<S {Par}.> My Lord you do me most insupportable vexati-on.
1136  _
1137  *<S {Laf}.> I would it were #hell paines for thy sake, and my
1138  *poore doing eternall: for doing I am past, as I will by
1139   thee, in what motion age will giue me leaue.  <D {Exit}.>
1140  *<S {Par}.> Well, thou hast a sonne shall take this disgrace
1141  *off me; scuruy, old, filthy, scuruy Lord: Well, I must
1142  *be patient, there is no fettering of authority. Ile beate
1143  *him (by my life) if I can meete him with any conueni-ence,
1144  *#and he were double and double a Lord. Ile haue
1145  *no more pittie of his age then I would haue of=== Ile
1146   beate him, #and if I could but meet him agen.
1147   <D {Enter Lafew}.>
1148  *<S {Laf}.> Sirra, your Lord and masters married, there's
1149   newes for you: you haue a new Mistris.
1150  *<S {Par}.> I most vnfainedly beseech your Lordshippe to
1151  *make some reseruation of your wrongs. He is my good
1152   Lord, whom I serue aboue is my master.
1153   <S {Laf}.> Who? God.
1154   <S {Par}.> #I sir.
1155  *<S {Laf}.> The deuill it is, that's thy master. Why dooest
1156  *thou garter vp thy armes #a this fashion? Dost make hose
1157  *of thy sleeues? Do other seruants so? Thou wert best set
1158  *thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine Honor,
1159  *if I were but two houres yonger, I'de beate thee: mee- think'st
1160  *thou art a generall offence, and euery man shold
1161  *beate thee: I thinke thou wast created for men to breath
1162   themselues vpon thee.
1163  *<S {Par}.> This is hard and vndeserued measure my Lord.
1164  *<S {Laf}.> Go #too sir, you were beaten in {Italy} for picking
1165  *a kernell out of a Pomgranat, you are a vagabond, and
1166  *no true traueller: you are more sawcie with Lordes and
1167  *honourable personages, then the Commission of your
1168  *birth and vertue giues you Heraldry. You are not worth
1169   another word, else I'de call you knaue. I leaue you.
1170   <D {Exit}>
1171   <D {Enter Count Rossillion}.>
1172  *<S {Par}.> Good, very good, it is so then: good, very
1173   good, let it be conceal'd awhile.
1174   <S {Ros}.> Vndone, and forfeited to cares for euer.
1175   <S {Par}.> What's the matter sweet- heart?
1176  *<S {Rossill}.> Although before the solemne Priest I haue
1177   sworne, I will not bed her.
1178   <S {Par}.> What? what sweet heart?
1179   <S {Ros}.> O my {Parrolles}, they haue married me:
1180   Ile to the {Tuscan} warres, and neuer bed her.
1181   <S {Par}.> {France} is a dog- hole, and it no more merits,
1182   The tread of a mans foot: too'th warres.
1183  *<S {Ros}.> There's letters from my mother: What th' im-port
1184   is, I know not yet.
1185  *<S {Par}.> #I that would be knowne: too'th warrs my boy,
1186   too'th warres:
1187   He weares his honor in a boxe vnseene,
1188   That hugges his kickie wickie heare at home,
1189   Spending his manlie marrow in her armes
1190   Which should sustaine the bound and high curuet
1191   Of {Marses} fierie steed: to other Regions,
1192   {France} is a stable, wee that dwell in't Iades,
1193   Therefore too'th warre.
1194   <S {Ros}.> It shall be so, Ile send her to my house,
1195   Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
1196   And wherefore I am fled: Write to the King
1197   That which I durst not speake. His present gift
1198   Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
1199   Where noble fellowes strike: Warres is no strife
1200   To the darke house, and the detected wife.
1201   <S {Par}.> Will this Caprichio hold in thee, art sure?
1202   <S {Ros}.> Go with me to my chamber, and aduice me.
1203   Ile send her straight away: To morrow,
1204   Ile to the warres, she to her single sorrow.
1205  *<S {Par}.> Why these bals bound, ther's noise in it. Tis hard
1206   A yong man maried, is a man that's mard:
1207   Therefore away, and leaue her brauely: go,
1208   The King ha's done you wrong: but hush 'tis so.  <D {Exit}>
1209   <D {Enter Helena and Clowne}.>
1210   <S {Hel}.> My mother greets me kindly, is she well?
1211  *<S {Clo}.> She is not well, but yet she has her health, she's
1212  *very merrie, but yet she is not well: but thankes be gi-uen
1213  *she's very well, and wants nothing i'th world: but
1214   yet she is not well.
1215  *<S {Hel}.> If she be verie wel, what do's she ayle, that she's
1216   not verie well?
1217  *<S {Clo}.> Truly she's very well indeed, but for two things
1218   <S {Hel}.> What two things?
1219  *<S {Clo}.> One, that she's not in heauen, whether God send
1220  *her quickly: the other, that she's in earth, from whence
1221   God send her quickly.
1222   <D {Enter Parolles}.>
1223   <S {Par}.> Blesse you my fortunate Ladie.
1224   <S {Hel}.> I hope sir I haue your good #will to haue mine
1225   owne good fortune.
1226  *<S {Par}.> You had my prayers to leade them on, and to
1227  *keepe them on, haue them still. O my knaue, how do's
1228   my old Ladie?
1229  *<S {Clo}.> So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money,
1230   I would she did as you say.
1231   <S {Par}.> Why I say nothing.
1232  *<S {Clo}.> Marry you are the wiser man: for many a mans
1233  *tongue shakes out his masters vndoing: to say nothing,
1234  *to do nothing, to know nothing, and to haue nothing,
1235  *is to be a great part of your title, which is within a verie
1236   little of nothing.
1237   <S {Par}.> Away, th'art a knaue.
1238  *<S {Clo}.> You should haue said sir before a knaue, th'art a
1239  *knaue, that's before me th'art a knaue: this had beene
1240   truth sir.
1241   <S {Par}.> Go #too, thou art a wittie foole, I haue found
1242   thee.
1243  *<S {Clo}.> Did you finde me in your selfe sir, or were you
1244   taught to finde me?
1245  *<S {Clo}.> The search sir was profitable, and much Foole
1246  *may you find in you, euen to the worlds pleasure, and the
1247   encrease of laughter.
1248   <S {Par}.> A good knaue ifaith, and well fed.
1249   Madam, my Lord will go awaie to night,
      <P V6v>
1250   A verie serrious businesse call's on him:
1251   The great prerogatiue and rite of loue,
1252  *Which as your due time claimes, he do's acknowledge,
1253   But puts it off to a compell'd restraint:
1254   Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets
1255   Which they distill now in the curbed time,
1256   To make the comming houre oreflow with ioy,
1257   And pleasure drowne the brim.
1258   <S {Hel}.> What's his #will else?
1259  *<S {Par}.> That you will take your instant leaue a'th king,
1260   And make this #hast as your owne good proceeding,
1261   Strengthned with what Apologie you thinke
1262   May make it probable neede.
1263   <S {Hel}.> What more commands hee?
1264   <S {Par}.> That hauing this obtain'd, you presentlie
1265   Attend his further pleasure.
1266   <S {Hel}.> In euery thing I waite vpon his #will.
1267   <S {Par}.> I shall report it so.  <D {Exit Par}.>
1268   <S {Hell}.> I pray you come sirrah.  <D {Exit}>
1269   <D {Enter Lafew and Bertram}.>
1270  *<S {Laf}.> But I hope your Lordshippe thinkes not him a
1271   souldier.
1272   <S {Ber}.> Yes my Lord and of verie valiant approofe.
1273   <S {Laf}.> You haue it from his owne deliuerance.
1274   <S {Ber}.> And by other warranted testimonie.
1275  *<S {Laf}.> Then my Diall goes not true, I tooke this Larke
1276   for a bunting.
1277  *<S {Ber}.> I do assure you my Lord he is very great in know-ledge,
1278   and accordinglie valiant.
1279  *<S {Laf}.> I haue then sinn'd against his experience, and
1280  *transgrest against his valour, and my state that way is
1281  *dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent:
1282  *Heere he comes, I pray you make vs freinds, I will pur-sue
1283   the amitie.
1284   <D {Enter Parolles}.>
1285   <S {Par}.> These things shall be done sir.
1286   <S {Laf}.> Pray you sir whose his Tailor?
1287   <S {Par}.> Sir?
1288  *<S {Laf}.> O I know him well, #I sir, hee sirs a good worke-man,
1289   a verie good Tailor.
1290   <S {Ber}.> Is shee gone to the king?
1291   <S {Par}.> Shee is.
1292   <S {Ber}.> Will shee away to night?
1293   <S {Par}.> As you'le haue her.
1294   <S {Ber}.> I haue writ my letters, casketted my treasure,
1295   Giuen order for our horses, and to night,
1296   When I should take possession of the Bride,
1297   And ere I doe begin.
1298  *<S {Laf}.> A good Trauailer is something at the latter end
1299  *of a dinner, but #on that lies three thirds, and vses a
1300  *known truth to passe a thousand nothings with, should
1301  *bee once hard, and thrice beaten. God saue you Cap-taine.
1302  _
1303  *<S {Ber}.> Is there any vnkindnes betweene my Lord and
1304   you Monsieur?
1305  *<S {Par}.> I know not how I haue deserued to run into my
1306   Lords displeasure.
1307  *<S {Laf}.> You haue made shift to run into't, bootes and
1308  *spurres and all: like him that leapt into the Custard, and
1309  *out of it you'le runne againe, rather then suffer question
1310   for your residence.
1311   <S {Ber}.> It may bee you haue mistaken him my Lord.
1312  *<S {Laf}.> And shall doe so euer, though I tooke him at's
1313  *prayers. Fare you well my Lord, and beleeue this of
1314  *me, there can be no kernell in this light Nut: the soule
1315  *of this man is his cloathes: Trust him not in matter of
1316  *heauie consequence: I haue kept of them tame, & know
1317  *their natures. Farewell Monsieur, I haue spoken better
1318  *of you, then you haue or will to deserue at my hand, but
1319   we must do good against euill.
1320   <S {Par}.> An idle Lord, I sweare.
1321   <S {Ber}.> I thinke so.
1322   <S {Par}.> Why do you not know him?
1323   <S {Ber}.> Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
1324   Giues him a worthy passe. Heere comes my clog.
1325   <D {Enter Helena}.>
1326   <S {Hel}.> I haue sir as I was commanded from you
1327   Spoke with the King, and haue procur'd his leaue
1328   For present parting, onely he desires
1329   Some priuate speech with you.
1330   <S {Ber}.> I shall obey his #will.
1331   You must not meruaile {Helen} at my course,
1332   Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
1333   The ministration, and required office
1334   On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
1335   For such a businesse, therefore am I found
1336   So much vnsetled: This driues me to intreate you,
1337   That presently you take your way for home,
1338   And rather muse then aske why I intreate you,
1339   For my respects are better then they seeme,
1340   And my appointments haue in them a neede
1341   Greater then shewes it selfe at the first view,
1342   To you that know them not. This to my mother,
1343   'Twill be two daies ere I shall see you, so
1344   I leaue you to your wisedome.
1345   <S {Hel}.> Sir, I can nothing say,
1346   But that I am your most obedient seruant.
1347   <S {Ber}.> Come, come, no more of that.
1348   <S {Hel}.> And euer shall
1349   With true obseruance seeke to eeke out that
1350   Wherein toward me my homely starres haue faild
1351   To equall my great fortune.
1352  *<S {Ber}.> Let that goe: my #hast is verie great. Farwell:
1353   Hie home.
1354   <S {Hel}.> Pray sir your pardon.
1355   <S {Ber}.> Well, what would you say?
1356   <S {Hel}.> I am not worthie of the wealth I owe,
1357   Nor dare I say 'tis mine: and yet it is,
1358   But like a timorous theefe, most faine would steale
1359   What law does vouch mine owne.
1360   <S {Ber}.> What would you haue?
1361  *<S {Hel}.> Something, and scarse so much: nothing indeed,
1362   I would not tell you what I would my Lord: Faith yes,
1363   Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kisse.
1364   <S {Ber}.> I pray you stay not, but in #hast to horse.
1365  *<S {Hel}.> I shall not breake your bidding, good my Lord:
1366   Where are my other men? Monsieur, farwell.  <D {Exit}>
1367  *<S {Ber}.> Go thou toward home, where I wil neuer come,
1368   Whilst I can shake my sword, or heare the drumme:
1369   Away, and for our flight.
1370   <S {Par}.> Brauely, Coragio.
1371   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1372  *<D {Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, the two Frenchmen},
1373   {with a troope of Souldiers}.>
1374  *<S {Duke}.> So that from point to point, now haue you heard
      <P X1>
1375   The fundamentall reasons of this warre,
1376   Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
1377   And more thirsts after.
1378   <S 1.{Lord}.> Holy seemes the quarrell
1379   Vpon your Graces part: blacke and fearefull
1380   On the opposer.
1381  *<S {Duke}.> Therefore we meruaile much our Cosin France
1382   Would in so iust a businesse, shut his bosome
1383   Against our borrowing prayers.
1384   <S {French} {E}.> Good my Lord,
1385   The reasons of our state I cannot yeelde,
1386   But like a common and an outward man,
1387   That the great figure of a Counsaile frames,
1388   By selfe vnable motion, therefore dare not
1389   Say what I thinke of it, since I haue found
1390   My selfe in my incertaine grounds to faile
1391   As often as I guest.
1392   <S {Duke}.> Be it his pleasure.
1393   <S {Fren.G}.> But I am sure the yonger of our nature,
1394   That surfet on their ease, will day by day
1395   Come heere for Physicke.
1396   <S {Duke}.> Welcome shall they bee:
1397   And all the honors that can flye from vs,
1398   Shall on them settle: you know your places well,
1399   When better fall, for your auailes they fell,
1400   To morrow to'th the field.  <D {Flourish}.>
1401   <D {Enter Countesse and Clowne}.>
1402  *<S {Count}.> It hath happen'd all, as I would haue had it, saue
1403   that he comes not along with her.
1404  *<S {Clo}.> By my troth I take my young Lord to be a ve-rie
1405   melancholly man.
1406   <S {Count}.> By what obseruance I pray you.
1407  *<S {Clo}.> Why he will looke vppon his boote, and sing:
1408  *mend the Ruffe and sing, aske questions and sing, picke
1409  *his teeth, and sing: I know a man that had this tricke of
1410   melancholy hold a goodly Mannor for a song.
1411  *<S {Lad}.> Let me see what he writes, and when he meanes
1412   to come.
1413  *<S {Clow}.> I haue no minde to {Isbell} since I was at Court.
1414  *Our old Lings, and our {Isbels} a'th Country, are nothing
1415  *like your old Ling and your {Isbels} a'th Court: the brains
1416  *of my Cupid's knock'd out, and I beginne to loue, as an
1417   old man loues money, with no stomacke.
1418   <S {Lad}.> What haue we heere?
1419   <S {Clo}.> In that you haue there.  <D {Exit}>
1420   <D {A Letter}.>
1421  *{I haue sent you a daughter- in- Law, shee hath recouered the}
1422  *{#King, and vndone me: I haue wedded her, not bedded her},
1423  *{and sworne to make the #not eternall. You shall heare I am}
1424  *{runne away, know it before the report come. If there bee}
1425  *{bredth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My}
1426   {duty to you.  Your vnfortunate sonne},
1427   Bertram.
1428   This is not well rash and vnbridled boy,
1429   To flye the fauours of so good a King,
1430   To plucke his indignation on thy head,
1431   By the misprising of a Maide too vertuous
1432   For the contempt of Empire.
1433   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
1434  *<S {Clow}.> O Madam, yonder is heauie newes within be-tweene
1435   two souldiers, and my yong Ladie.
1436   <S {La}.> What is the matter.
1437  *<S {Clo}.> Nay there is some comfort in the newes, some
1438  *comfort, your sonne will not be kild so soone as I thoght
1439   he would.
1440   <S {La}.> Why should he be kill'd?
1441  *<S {Clo}.> So say I Madame, if he runne away, as I heare he
1442  *does, the danger is in standing too't, that's the losse of
1443  *men, though it be the getting of children. Heere they
1444  *come will tell you more. For my part I onely heare your
1445   sonne was run away.
1446   <D {Enter Hellen and two Gentlemen}.>
1447   <S {French} {E}.> Saue you good Madam.
1448   <S {Hel}.> Madam, my Lord is gone, for euer gone.
1449   <S {French} {G}.> Do not say so.
1450   <S {La}.> Thinke vpon patience, pray you Gentlemen,
1451   I haue felt so many quirkes of ioy and greefe,
1452   That the first face of neither on the start
1453  *Can woman me vntoo't. Where is my sonne I pray you?
1454  *<S {Fren.G}.> Madam he's gone to serue the Duke of Flo-rence,
1455  _
1456   We met him thitherward, for thence we came:
1457   And after some dispatch in hand at Court,
1458   Thither we bend againe.
1459  *<S {Hel}.> Looke on his Letter Madam, here's my Pasport.
1460  *{When thou canst get the Ring vpon my finger, which neuer}
1461  *{shall come off, and shew mee a childe begotten of thy bodie},
1462  *{that I am father #too, then call me husband: but in such a (#then})
1463   {I write a #Neuer}.
1464   This is a dreadfull sentence.
1465   <S {La}.> Brought you this Letter Gentlemen?
1466  *<S 1.{G}.> #I Madam, and for the Contents sake are sorrie
1467   for our paines.
1468   <S {Old} {La}.> I prethee Ladie haue a better cheere,
1469   If thou engrossest, all the greefes are thine,
1470   Thou robst me of a moity: He was my sonne,
1471   But I do wash his name out of my blood,
1472   And thou art all my childe. Towards Florence is he?
1473   <S {Fren.G}.> #I Madam.
1474   <S {La}.> And to be a souldier.
1475   <S {Fren.G}.> Such is his noble purpose, and beleeu't
1476   The Duke will lay vpon him all the honor
1477   That good conuenience claimes.
1478   <S {La}.> Returne you thither.
1479   <S {Fren.E}.> #I Madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
1480   <S {Hel}.> {Till I haue no wife, I haue nothing in France},
1481   'Tis bitter.
1482   <S {La}.> Finde you that there?
1483   <S {Hel}.> #I Madame.
1484  *<S {Fren.E}.> 'Tis but the boldnesse of his hand haply, which
1485   his heart was not consenting #too.
1486   <S {Lad}.> Nothing in France, vntill he haue no wife:
1487   There's nothing heere that is too good for him
1488   But onely she, and she deserues a Lord
1489   That twenty such rude boyes might tend vpon,
1490   And call her hourely Mistris. Who was with him?
1491  *<S {Fren.E}.> A seruant onely, and a Gentleman: which I
1492   haue sometime knowne.
1493   <S {La}.> {Parolles} was it not?
1494   <S {Fren.E}.> #I my good Ladie, hee.
1495  *<S {La}.> A verie tainted fellow, and full of wickednesse,
1496   My sonne corrupts a well deriued nature
1497   With his inducement.
1498  *<S {Fren.E}.> Indeed good Ladie the fellow has a deale of
1499   that, too much, which holds him much to haue.
1500  *<S {La}.> Y'are welcome Gentlemen, I will intreate you
1501  *when you see my sonne, to tell him that his sword can
1502  *neuer winne the honor that he looses: more Ile intreate
      <P X1v>
1503   you written to beare along.
1504  *<S {Fren.G}.> We serue you Madam in that and all your
1505   worthiest affaires.
1506   <S {La}.> Not so, but as we change our courtesies,
1507   Will you draw neere?  <D {Exit}.>
1508   <S {Hel}.> {Till I haue no wife I haue nothing in France}.
1509   Nothing in France vntill he has no wife:
1510   Thou shalt haue none {Rossillion}, none in France,
1511   Then hast thou all againe: poore Lord, is't I
1512   That chase thee from thy Countrie, and expose
1513   Those tender limbes of thine, to the euent
1514   Of the none- sparing warre? And is it I,
1515   That driue thee from the sportiue Court, where thou
1516   Was't shot at with faire eyes, to be the marke
1517   Of smoakie Muskets? O you leaden messengers,
1518   That ride vpon the violent speede of fire,
1519   Fly with false ayme, moue the still- peering aire
1520   That sings with piercing, do not touch my Lord:
1521   Who euer shoots at him, I set him there.
1522   Who euer charges on his forward brest
1523   I am the Caitiffe that do hold him too't,
1524   And though I kill him not, I am the cause
1525   His death was so effected: Better 'twere
1526   I met the rauine Lyon when he roar'd
1527   With sharpe constraint of hunger: better 'twere,
1528   That all the miseries which nature owes
1529   Were mine at once. No come thou home {Rossillion},
1530   Whence honor but of danger winnes a scarre,
1531   As oft it looses all. I will be gone:
1532   My being heere it is, that holds thee hence,
1533   Shall I stay heere to doo't? No, no, although
1534   The ayre of Paradise did fan the house,
1535   And Angels offic'd all: I will be gone,
1536   That pittifull rumour may report my flight
1537   To consolate thine eare. Come night, end day,
1538   For with the darke (poore theefe) Ile steale away.  <D {Exit}.>
1539   <D {Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Rossillion},
1540   {drum and trumpets, soldiers, Parrolles}.>
1541   <S {Duke}.> The Generall of our horse thou art, and we
1542   Great in our hope, lay our best loue and credence
1543   Vpon thy promising fortune.
1544   <S {Ber}.> Sir it is
1545   A charge too heauy for my strength, but yet
1546   Wee'l striue to beare it for your worthy sake,
1547   To th' extreme edge of hazard.
1548   <S {Duke}.> Then go thou forth,
1549   And fortune play vpon thy prosperous helme
1550   As thy auspicious mistris.
1551   <S {Ber}.> This very day
1552   Great Mars I put my selfe into thy file,
1553   Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall proue
1554   A louer of thy drumme, hater of loue.  <D {Exeunt omnes}>
1555   <D {Enter Countesse & Steward}.>
1556   <S {La}.> Alas! and would you take the letter of her:
1557   Might you not know she would do, as she has done,
1558   By sending me a Letter. Reade it agen.
1559   <D {Letter}.>
1560   {I am S[aint]. Iaques Pilgrim, thither gone:}
1561   {Ambitious loue hath so in me offended},
1562   {That bare- foot plod I the cold ground vpon}
1563   {With sainted vow my faults to haue amended}
1564   {Write, write, that from the bloodie course of warre},
1565   {My deerest Master your deare sonne, may hie},
1566   {Blesse him at home in peace. Whilst I from farre},
1567   {His name with zealous feruour sanctifie:}
1568   {His taken labours bid him me forgiue:}
1569   {I his despightfull Iuno sent him forth},
1570   {From Courtly friends, with Camping foes to liue},
1571   {Where death and danger dogges the heeles of worth}.
1572   {He is too good and faire for death, and mee},
1573   {Whom I my selfe embrace, to set him free}.
1574   Ah what sharpe stings are in her mildest words?
1575   {Rynaldo}, you did neuer lacke aduice so much,
1576   As letting her passe so: had I spoke with her,
1577   I could haue well diuerted her intents,
1578   Which thus she hath preuented.
1579   <S {Ste}.> Pardon me Madam,
1580   If I had giuen you this at ouer- night,
1581   She might haue beene ore- tane: and yet she writes
1582   Pursuite would be but vaine.
1583   <S {La}.> What Angell shall
1584   Blesse this vnworthy husband, he cannot thriue,
1585   Vnlesse her prayers, whom heauen delights to heare
1586   And loues to grant, repreeue him from the wrath
1587   Of greatest Iustice. Write, write {Rynaldo},
1588   To this vnworthy husband of his wife,
1589   Let euerie word waigh heauie of her worth,
1590   That he does waigh too light: my greatest greefe,
1591   Though little he do feele it, set downe sharpely.
1592   Dispatch the most conuenient messenger,
1593   When haply he shall heare that she is gone,
1594   He will returne, and hope I may that shee
1595   Hearing so much, will speede her foote againe,
1596   Led hither by pure loue: which of them both
1597   Is deerest to me, I haue no skill in sence
1598   To make distinction: prouide this Messenger:
1599   My heart is heauie, and mine age is weake,
1600   Greefe would haue teares, and sorrow bids me speake.
1601   <D {Exeunt}>
1602   <D {A Tucket afarre off}.>
1603   <D {Enter old Widdow of Florence, her daughter Violenta}
1604   {and Mariana, with other}
1605   {Citizens}.>
1606   <S {Widdow}.> Nay come,
1607   For if they do approach the Citty,
1608   We shall loose all the sight.
1609   <S {Diana}.> They say, the French Count has done
1610   Most honourable seruice.
1611   <S {Wid}.> It is reported,
1612   That he has taken their great'st Commander,
1613   And that with his owne hand he slew
1614   The Dukes brother: we haue lost our labour,
1615   They are gone a contrarie way: harke,
1616   you may know by their Trumpets.
1617   <S {Maria}.> Come lets returne againe,
1618   And suffice our selues with the report of it.
1619   Well {Diana}, take heed of this French Earle,
1620   The honor of a Maide is her name,
1621   And no Legacie is so rich
1622   As honestie.
1623   <S {Widdow}.> I haue told my neighbour
1624   How you haue beene solicited by a Gentleman
1625   His Companion.
      <P X2>
1626  *<S {Maria}.> I know that knaue, hang him, one {Parolles},
1627  *a filthy Officer he is in those suggestions for the young
1628  *Earle, beware of them {Diana}; their promises, entise-ments,
1629  *oathes, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are
1630  *not the things they go vnder: many a maide hath beene
1631  *seduced by them, and the miserie is example, that so
1632  *terrible shewes in the wracke of maiden- hood, cannot
1633  *for all that disswade succession, but that they are limed
1634  *with the twigges that threatens them. I hope I neede
1635  *not to aduise you further, but I hope your owne grace
1636  *will keepe you where you are, though there were no
1637  *further danger knowne, but the modestie which is so
1638   lost.
1639   <S {Dia}.> You shall not neede to feare me.
1640   <D {Enter Hellen}.>
1641  *<S {Wid}.> I hope so: looke here comes a pilgrim, I know
1642  *she will lye at my house, thither they send one another,
1643  *Ile question her. God saue you pilgrim, whether are
1644   bound?
1645   <S {Hel}.> To S[aint]. {Iaques la grand}.
1646   Where do the Palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
1647   <S {Wid}.> At the S[aint]. {Francis} heere beside the Port.
1648   <S {Hel}.> Is this the way?  <D {A march afarre}.>
1649  *<S {Wid}.> #I marrie ist. Harke you, they come this way:
1650   If you will tarrie holy Pilgrime
1651   But till the troopes come by,
1652   I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd,
1653   The rather for I thinke I know your hostesse
1654   As ample as my selfe.
1655   <S {Hel}.> Is it your selfe?
1656   <S {Wid}.> If you shall please so Pilgrime.
1657  *<S {Hel}.> I thanke you, and will stay vpon your leisure.
1658   <S {Wid}.> You came I thinke from {France}?
1659   <S {Hel}.> I did so.
1660   <S {Wid}.> Heere you shall see a Countriman of yours
1661   That has done worthy seruice.
1662   <S {Hel}.> His name I pray you?
1663   <S {Dia}.> The Count {Rossillion}: know you such a one?
1664  *<S {Hel}.> But by the eare that heares most nobly of him:
1665   His face I know not.
1666   <S {Dia}.> What somere he is
1667   He's brauely taken heere. He stole from {France}
1668   As 'tis reported: for the King had married him
1669   Against his liking. Thinke you it is so?
1670   <S {Hel}.> #I surely meere the truth, I know his Lady.
1671   <S {Dia}.> There is a Gentleman that serues the Count,
1672   Reports but coursely of her.
1673   <S {Hel}.> What's his name?
1674   <S {Dia}.> Monsieur {Parrolles}.
1675   <S {Hel}.> Oh I beleeue with him,
1676   In argument of praise, or to the worth
1677   Of the great Count himselfe, she is too meane
1678   To haue her name repeated, all her deseruing
1679   Is a reserued honestie, and that
1680   I haue not heard examin'd.
1681   <S {Dian}.> Alas poore Ladie,
1682   'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
1683   Of a detesting Lord.
1684   <S {Wid}.> I write good creature, wheresoere she is,
1685   Her hart waighes sadly: this yong maid might do her
1686   A shrewd turne if she pleas'd.
1687   <S {Hel}.> How do you meane?
1688   May be the amorous Count solicites her
1689   In the vnlawfull purpose.
1690   <S {Wid}.> He does indeede,
1691   And brokes with all that can in such a suite
1692   Corrupt the tender honour of a Maide:
1693   But she is arm'd for him, and keepes her guard
1694   In honestest defence.
1695   <D {Drumme and Colours}.
1696   {Enter Count Rossillion, Parrolles, and the whole Armie}.>
1697   <S {Mar}.> The goddes forbid else.
1698   <S {Wid}.> So, now they come:
1699   That is {Anthonio} the Dukes eldest sonne,
1700   That {Escalus}.
1701   <S {Hel}.> Which is the Frenchman?
1702   <S {Dia}.> Hee,
1703   That with the plume, 'tis a most gallant fellow,
1704   I would he lou'd his wife: if he were honester
1705  *He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsom Gentleman
1706   <S {Hel}.> I like him well.
1707  *<S {Di}.> 'Tis pitty he is not honest: yonds that same knaue
1708   That leades him to these places: were I his Ladie,
1709   I would poison that vile Rascall.
1710   <S {Hel}.> Which is he?
1711  *<S {Dia}.> That Iacke- an- apes with scarfes. Why is hee
1712   melancholly?
1713   <S {Hel}.> Perchance he's hurt i'th battaile.
1714   <S {Par}.> Loose our drum? Well.
1715  *<S {Mar}.> He's shrewdly vext at something. Looke he
1716   has spyed vs.
1717   <S {Wid}.> Marrie hang you.
1718   <S {Mar}.> And your curtesie, for a ring- carrier.  <D {Exit}.>
1719  *<S {Wid}.> The troope is past: Come pilgrim, I wil bring
1720   you, Where you shall host: Of inioyn'd penitents
1721   There's foure or fiue, to great S[aint]. {Iaques} bound,
1722   Alreadie at my house.
1723   <S {Hel}.> I humbly thanke you:
1724   Please it this Matron, and this gentle Maide
1725   To eate with vs to night, the charge and thanking
1726   Shall be for me, and to requite you further,
1727   I will bestow some precepts of this Virgin,
1728   Worthy the note.
1729   <S {Both}.> Wee'l take your offer kindly.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1730   <D {Enter Count Rossillion and the Frenchmen},
1731   {as at first}.>
1732  *<S {Cap.E}.> Nay good my Lord put him too't: let him
1733   haue his way.
1734  *<S {Cap.G}.> If your Lordshippe finde him not a Hilding,
1735   hold me no more in your respect.
1736   <S {Cap.E}.> On my life my Lord, a bubble.
1737   <S {Ber}.> Do you thinke I am so farre
1738   Deceiued in him.
1739  *<S {Cap.E}.> Beleeue it my Lord, in mine owne direct
1740  *knowledge, without any malice, but to speake of him
1741  *as my kinsman, hee's a most notable Coward, an infi-nite
1742  *and endlesse Lyar, an hourely promise- breaker, the
1743  *owner of no one good qualitie, worthy your Lordships
1744   entertainment.
1745  *<S {Cap.G}.> It were fit you knew him, least reposing too
1746  *farre in his vertue which he hath not, he might at some
1747  *great and trustie businesse, in a maine daunger, fayle
1748   you.
1749  *<S {Ber}.> I would I knew in what particular action to try
1750   him.
1751  *<S {Cap.G}.> None better then to let him fetch off his
1752  *drumme, which you heare him so confidently vnder-take
1753   to do.
1754  *<S {C.E}.> I with a troop of Florentines wil sodainly sur-prize
      <P X2v>
1755  *him; such I will haue whom I am sure he knowes
1756  *not from the enemie: wee will binde and hoodwinke
1757  *him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is car-ried
1758  *into the Leager of the aduersaries, when we bring
1759  *him to our owne tents: be but your Lordship present
1760  *at his examination, if he do not for the promise of his
1761  *life, and in the highest compulsion of base feare, offer to
1762  *betray you, and deliuer all the intelligence in his power
1763  *against you, and that with the diuine forfeite of his
1764  *soule vpon oath, neuer trust my iudgement in anie
1765   thing.
1766  *<S {Cap.G}.> O for the loue of laughter, let him fetch his
1767  *drumme, he sayes he has a stratagem for't: when your
1768  *Lordship sees the bottome of this successe in't, and to
1769  *what mettle this counterfeyt lump of ours will be mel-ted
1770  *if you giue him not Iohn drummes entertainement,
1771   your inclining cannot be remoued. Heere he comes.
1772   <D {Enter Parrolles}.>
1773  *<S {Cap.E}.> O for the loue of laughter hinder not the ho-nor
1774  *of his designe, let him fetch off his drumme in any
1775   hand.
1776  *<S {Ber}.> How now Monsieur? This drumme sticks sore-ly
1777   in your disposition.
1778   <S {Cap.G}.> A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drumme.
1779  *<S {Par}.> But a drumme: Ist but a drumme? A drum so
1780  *lost. There was excellent command, to charge in with
1781  *our horse vpon our owne wings, and to rend our owne
1782   souldiers.
1783  *<S {Cap.G}.> That was not to be blam'd in the command
1784  *of the seruice: it was a disaster of warre that {Caesar} him
1785  *selfe could not haue preuented, if he had beene there to
1786   command.
1787  *<S {Ber}.> Well, wee cannot greatly condemne our suc-cesse:
1788  *some dishonor wee had in the losse of that drum,
1789   but it is not to be recouered.
1790   <S {Par}.> It might haue beene recouered.
1791   <S {Ber}.> It might, but it is not now.
1792  *<S {Par}.> It is to be recouered, but that the merit of ser-uice
1793  *is sildome attributed to the true and exact perfor-mer,
1794  *I would haue that drumme or another, or {hic ia-cet}.
1795  _
1796  *<S {Ber}.> Why if you haue a stomacke, too't Monsieur: if
1797  *you thinke your mysterie in stratagem, can bring this
1798  *instrument of honour againe into his natiue quarter, be
1799  *magnanimious in the enterprize and go on, I wil grace
1800  *the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speede well in
1801  *it, the Duke shall both speake of it, and extend to you
1802  *what further becomes his greatnesse, euen to the vtmost
1803   syllable of your worthinesse.
1804   <S {Par}.> By the hand of a souldier I will vndertake it.
1805   <S {Ber}.> But you must not now slumber in it.
1806  *<S {Par}.> Ile about it this euening, and I will presently
1807  *pen downe my dilemma's, encourage my selfe in my
1808  *certaintie, put my selfe into my mortall preparation:
1809   and by midnight looke to heare further from me.
1810  *<S {Ber}.> May I bee bold to acquaint his grace you are
1811   gone about it.
1812  *<S {Par}.> I know not what the successe wil be my Lord,
1813   but the attempt I vow.
1814   <S {Ber}.> I know th'art valiant,
1815   And to the possibility of thy souldiership,
1816   Will subscribe for thee: Farewell.
1817   <S {Par}.> I loue not many words.  <D {Exit}>
1818  *<S {Cap.E}.> No more then a fish loues water. Is not this
1819  *a strange fellow my Lord, that so confidently seemes to
1820  *vndertake this businesse, which he knowes is not to be
1821  *done, damnes himselfe to do, & dares better be damnd
1822   then to doo't.
1823  *<S {Cap.G}.> You do not know him my Lord as we doe,
1824  *certaine it is that he will steale himselfe into a mans fa-uour,
1825  *and for a weeke escape a great deale of discoue-ries,
1826  *but  when you finde him out, you haue him euer af-ter.
1827  _
1828  *<S {Ber}.> Why do you thinke he will make no deede at
1829  *all of this that so seriouslie hee dooes addresse himselfe
1830   vnto?
1831  *<S {Cap.E}.> None in the world, but returne with an in-uention,
1832  *and clap vpon you two or three probable lies:
1833  *but we haue almost imbost him, you shall see  his fall to
1834  *night; for indeede he is not for your Lordshippes re-spect.
1835  _
1836  *<S {Cap.G}.> Weele make you some sport with the Foxe
1837  *ere we case him. He was first smoak'd by the old Lord
1838  *{#Lafew}, when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what
1839  *a sprat you shall finde him, which you shall see this ve-rie
1840   night.
1841   <S {Cap.E}.> I must go looke my twigges,
1842   He shall be caught.
1843   <S {Ber}.> Your brother he shall go along with me.
1844   <S {Cap.G}.> As't please your Lordship, Ile leaue you.
1845  *<S {Ber}.> Now wil I lead you to the house, and shew you
1846   The Lasse I spoke of.
1847   <S {Cap.E}.> But you say she's  honest.
1848  *<S {Ber}.> That's all the fault: I spoke with hir but once,
1849   And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her
1850   By this same Coxcombe that we haue i'th winde
1851   Tokens and Letters, which she did resend,
1852   And this is all I haue done: She's a faire creature,
1853   Will you go see her?
1854   <S {Cap.E}.> With all my heart my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}>
1855   <D {Enter Hellen, and Widdow}.>
1856   <S {Hel}.> If you misdoubt me that I am not shee,
1857   I know not how I shall assure you further,
1858   But I shall loose the grounds I worke vpon.
1859   <S {Wid}.> Though my estate be falne, I was well borne,
1860   Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
1861   And would not put my reputation now
1862   In any staining act.
1863   <S {Hel}.> Nor would I wish you.
1864   First giue me trust, the Count he is my husband,
1865   And what to your sworne counsaile I haue spoken,
1866   Is so from word to word: and then you cannot
1867   By the good ayde that I of you shall borrow,
1868   Erre in bestowing it.
1869   <S {Wid}.> I should beleeue you,
1870   For you haue shew'd me that which well approues
1871   Y'are great in fortune.
1872   <S {Hel}.> Take this purse of Gold,
1873   And let me buy your friendly helpe thus farre,
1874   Which I will ouer- pay, and pay againe
1875   When I haue found it. The Count he woes your
1876   daughter,
1877   Layes downe his wanton siedge before her beautie,
1878   Resolue to carrie her: let her in fine consent
1879   As wee'l direct her how 'tis best to beare it:
1880   Now his important blood will naught denie,
1881   That shee'l demand: a ring the Countie weares,
1882   That downward hath succeeded in his house
      <P X3>
1883   From sonne to sonne, some foure or fiue discents,
1884   Since the first father wore it. This Ring he holds
1885   In most rich choice: yet in his idle fire,
1886   To buy his #will, it would not seeme too deere,
1887   How ere repented after.
1888   <S {Wid}.> Now I see the bottome of your purpose.
1889   <S {Hel}.> You see it lawfull then, it is no more,
1890   But that your daughter ere she seemes as wonne,
1891   Desires this Ring; appoints him an encounter;
1892   In fine, deliuers me to fill the time,
1893   Her selfe most chastly absent: after
1894   To marry her, Ile adde three thousand Crownes
1895   To what is past already.
1896   <S {Wid}.> I haue yeelded:
1897   Instruct my daughter how she shall perseuer,
1898   That time and place with this deceite so lawfull
1899   May proue coherent. Euery night he comes
1900   With Musickes of all sorts, and songs compos'd
1901   To her vnworthinesse: It nothing steeds vs
1902   To chide him from our eeues, for he persists
1903   As if his life lay on't.
1904   <S {Hel}.> Why then to night
1905   Let vs assay our plot, which if it speed,
1906   Is wicked meaning in a lawfull deede;
1907   And lawfull meaning in a lawfull act,
1908   Where both not sinne, and yet a sinfull fact.
1909   But let's about it.
1910   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1911   <D {Enter one of the Frenchmen, with fiue or sixe other}
1912   {souldiers in ambush}.>
1913  *<S {Lord} {E}.> He can come no other way but by this hedge
1914  *corner: when you sallie vpon him, speake what terrible
1915  *Language you will: though you vnderstand it not your
1916  *selues, no matter: for we must not seeme to vnderstand
1917  *him, vnlesse some one among vs, whom wee must pro-duce
1918   for an Interpreter.
1919   <S 1.{Sol}.> Good Captaine, let me be th' Interpreter.
1920  *<S {Lor.E}.> Art not acquainted with him? knowes he not
1921   thy voice?
1922   <S 1.{Sol}.> No sir I warrant you.
1923  *<S {Lo.E}.> But what linsie wolsy hast thou to speake to vs
1924   againe.
1925   <S 1.{Sol}.> #E'n such as you speake to me.
1926  *<S {Lo.E}.> He must thinke vs some band of strangers, i'th
1927  *aduersaries entertainment. Now he hath a smacke of all
1928  *neighbouring Languages: therefore we must euery one
1929  *be a man of his owne fancie, not to know what we speak
1930  *one to another: so  we seeme to know, is to know straight
1931  *our purpose: Choughs language, gabble enough, and
1932  *good enough. As for you interpreter, you must seeme
1933  *very politicke. But couch hoa, heere hee comes, to be-guile
1934  *two houres in a sleepe, and then to returne & swear
1935   the lies he forges.
1936   <D {Enter Parrolles}.>
1937  *<S {Par}.> Ten #a clocke: Within these three houres 'twill
1938  *be time enough to goe home. What shall I say I haue
1939  *done? It must bee a very plausiue inuention that carries
1940  *it. They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces haue of
1941  *late, knock'd too often at my doore: I finde my tongue
1942  *is too foole- hardie, but my heart hath the feare of Mars
1943  *before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of
1944   my tongue.
1945  *<S {Lo.E}.> This is the first truth that ere thine own tongue
1946   was guiltie of.
1947  *<S {Par}.> What the diuell should moue mee to vndertake
1948  *the recouerie of this drumme, being not ignorant of the
1949  *impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
1950  *must giue my selfe some hurts, and say I got them in ex-ploit:
1951  *yet slight ones will not carrie it. They will say,
1952  *came you off with so little? And great ones I dare not
1953  *giue, wherefore what's the instance. Tongue, I must put
1954  *you into a Butter- womans mouth, and buy my selfe ano-ther
1955  *of {Baiazeths} Mule, if you prattle mee into these
1956   perilles.
1957  *<S {Lo.E}.> Is it possible he should know what hee is, and
1958   be that he is.
1959  *<S {Par}.> I would the cutting of my garments wold serue
1960   the turne, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
1961   <S {Lo.E}.> We cannot affoord you so.
1962  *<S {Par}.> Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in
1963   stratagem.
1964   <S {Lo.E}.> 'Twould not do.
1965  *<S {Par}.> Or to drowne my cloathes, and say I was stript.
1966   <S {Lo.E}.> Hardly serue.
1967  *<S {Par}.> Though I swore I leapt from the window of the
1968   Citadell.
1969   <S {Lo.E}.> How deepe?
1970   <S {Par}.> Thirty fadome.
1971  *<S {Lo.E}.> Three great oathes would scarse make that be
1972   beleeued.
1973  *<S {Par}.> I would I had any drumme of the enemies, I
1974   would sweare I recouer'd it.
1975   <S {Lo.E}.> You shall heare one anon.
1976   <S {Par}.> A drumme now of the enemies.
1977   <D {Alarum within}.>
1978   <S {Lo.E}.> {Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo}.
1979   <S {All}.> {Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo}.
1980   <S {Par}.> O ransome, ransome,
1981   Do not hide mine eyes.
1982   <S {Inter}.> {Boskos thromuldo boskos}.
1983   <S {Par}.> I know you are the {Muskos} Regiment,
1984   And I shall loose my life for want of language.
1985   If there be heere German or Dane, Low Dutch,
1986   Italian, or French, let him speake to me,
1987   Ile discouer that, which shal vndo the Florentine.
1988  *<S {Int}.> {Boskos vauvado}, I vnderstand thee, & can speake
1989  *thy tongue: {Kerelybonto} sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
1990   seuenteene ponyards are at thy bosome.
1991   <S {Par}.> Oh.
1992   <S {Inter}.> Oh pray, pray, pray,
1993   {Manka reuania dulche}.
1994   <S {Lo.E}.> {Oscorbidulchos voliuorco}.
1995   <S {Int}.> The Generall is content to spare thee yet,
1996   And hoodwinkt as thou art, will leade thee on
1997   To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst informe
1998   Something to saue thy life.
1999   <S {Par}.> O let me liue,
2000   And all the secrets of our campe Ile shew,
2001   Their force, their purposes: Nay, Ile speake that,
2002   Which you will wonder at.
2003   <S {Inter}.> But wilt thou faithfully?
2004   <S {Par}.> If I do not, damne me.
2005   <S {Inter}.> {Acordo linta}.
2006   Come on, thou are granted space.  <D {Exit}>
2007   <D {A short Alarum within}.>
      <P X3v>
2008  *<S {L.E}.> Go tell the Count {Rossillion} and my brother,
2009  *We haue caught the woodcocke, and will keepe him |(mufled
2010   Till we do heare from them.
2011   <S {Sol}.> Captaine I will.
2012   <S {L.E}.> #A will betray vs all vnto our selues,
2013   Informe on that.
2014   <S {Sol}.> So I will sir.
2015  *<S {L.E}.> Till then Ile keepe him darke and safely lockt.
2016   <D {Exit}>
2017   <D {Enter Bertram, and the Maide called}
2018   {Diana}.>
2019   <S {Ber}.> They told me that your name was {Fontybell}.
2020   <S {Dia}.> No my good Lord, {Diana}.
2021   <S {Ber}.> Titled Goddesse,
2022   And worth it with addition: but faire soule,
2023   In your fine frame hath loue no qualitie?
2024   If the quicke fire of youth light not your minde,
2025   You are no Maiden but a monument
2026   When you are dead you should be such a one
2027   As you are now: for you are cold and sterne,
2028   And now you should be as your mother was
2029   When your sweet selfe was got.
2030   <S {Dia}.> She then was honest.
2031   <S {Ber}.> So should you be.
2032   <S {Dia}.> No:
2033   My mother did but dutie, such (my Lord)
2034   As you owe to your wife.
2035   <S {Ber}.> No more a'that:
2036   I prethee do not striue against my vowes:
2037   I was compell'd to her, but I loue thee
2038   By loues owne sweet constraint, and will for euer
2039   Do thee all rights of seruice.
2040   <S {Dia}.> #I so you serue vs
2041   Till we serue you: But when you haue our Roses,
2042   You barely leaue our thornes to pricke our selues,
2043   And mocke vs with our barenesse.
2044   <S {Ber}.> How haue I sworne.
2045  *<S {Dia}.> Tis not the many oathes that makes the truth,
2046   But the plaine single vow, that is vow'd true:
2047   What is not holie, that we sweare not by,
2048  *But take the high'st to witnesse: then pray you tell me,
2049   If I should sweare by Ioues great attributes,
2050   I lou'd you deerely, would you beleeue my oathes,
2051   When I did loue you #ill? This ha's no holding
2052   To sweare by him whom I protest to loue
2053   That I will worke against him. Therefore your oathes
2054   Are words and poore conditions, but vnseal'd
2055   At lest in my opinion.
2056   <S {Ber}.> Change it, change it:
2057   Be not so holy cruell: Loue is holie,
2058   And my integritie ne're knew the crafts
2059   That you do charge men with: Stand no more off,
2060   But giue thy selfe vnto my sicke desires,
2061   Who then recouers. Say thou art mine, and euer
2062   My loue as it beginnes, shall so perseuer.
2063   <S {Dia}.> I see that men make rope's in such a scarre,
2064   That wee'l forsake our selues. Giue me that Ring.
2065   <S {Ber}.> Ile lend it thee my deere; but haue no power
2066   To giue it from me.
2067   <S {Dia}.> Will you not my Lord?
2068   <S {Ber}.> It is an honour longing to our house,
2069   Bequeathed downe from manie Ancestors,
2070   Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,
2071   In me to loose.
2072   <S {Dian}.> Mine Honors such a Ring,
2073   My chastities the Iewell of our house,
2074   Bequeathed downe from many Ancestors,
2075   Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,
2076   In mee to loose. Thus your owne proper wisedome
2077   Brings in the Champion honor on my part,
2078   Against your vaine assault.
2079   <S {Ber}.> Heere, take my Ring,
2080   My house, mine honor, yea my life be thine,
2081   And Ile be bid by thee.
2082   <S {Dia}.> When midnight comes, knocke at my cham-ber
2083   window:
2084   Ile order take, my mother shall not heare.
2085   Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
2086   When you haue conquer'd my yet maiden- bed,
2087   Remaine there but an houre, nor speake to mee:
2088  *My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them,
2089   When backe againe this Ring shall be deliuer'd:
2090   And on your finger in the night, Ile put
2091   Another Ring, that what in time proceeds,
2092   May token to the future, our past deeds.
2093   Adieu till then, then faile not: you haue wonne
2094   A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
2095  *<S {Ber}.> A heauen on earth I haue won by wooing thee.
2096  *<S {Di}.> For which, liue long to thank both heauen & me,
2097   You may so in the end.
2098   My mother told me iust how he would woo,
2099   As if she sate in's heart. She sayes, all men
2100   Haue the like oathes: He had sworne to marrie me
2101   When his wife's dead: therfore Ile lye with him
2102   When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braide,
2103   Marry that will, I liue and die a Maid:
2104   Onely in this disguise, I think't no sinne,
2105   To cosen him that would vniustly winne.  <D {Exit}>
2106   <D {Enter the two French Captaines, and some two or three}
2107   {Souldiours}.>
2108   <S {Cap.G}.> You haue not giuen him his mothers letter.
2109  *<S {Cap.E}.> I haue deliu'red it an houre since, there is som
2110  *thing in't that stings his nature: for on the reading it,
2111   he chang'd almost into another man.
2112  *<S {Cap.G}.> He has much worthy blame laid vpon him,
2113   for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a Lady.
2114  *<S {Cap.E}.> Especially, hee hath incurred the euerlasting
2115  *displeasure of the King, who had euen tun'd his bounty
2116  *to sing happinesse to him. I will tell you a thing, but
2117   you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
2118  *<S {Cap.G}.> When you haue spoken it 'tis dead, and I am
2119   the graue of it.
2120  *<S {Cap.E}.> Hee hath peruerted a young Gentlewoman
2121  *heere in {Florence}, of a most chaste renown, & this night
2122  *he fleshes his #will in the spoyle of her honour: hee hath
2123  *giuen her his monumentall Ring, and thinkes himselfe
2124   made in the vnchaste composition.
2125  *<S {Cap.G}.> Now God delay our rebellion as we are our
2126   selues, what things are we.
2127  *<S {Cap.E}.> Meerely our owne traitours. And as in the
2128  *common course of all treasons, we still see them reueale
2129  *themselues, till they attaine to their abhorr'd ends: so
2130  *he that in this action contriues against his owne Nobi-lity
2131   in his proper streame, ore- flowes himselfe.
2132  *<S {Cap.G}.> Is it not meant damnable in vs, to be Trum-peters
2133  *of our vnlawfull intents? We shall not then haue
2134   his company to night?
2135  *<S {Cap.E}.> Not till after midnight: for hee is dieted to
2136   his houre.
2137  *<S {Cap.G}.> That approaches apace: I would gladly haue
2138  *him see his company anathomiz'd, that hee might take
      <P X4>
2139  *a measure of his owne iudgements, wherein so curiously
2140   he had set this counterfeit.
2141  *<S {Cap.E}.> We will not meddle with him till he come;
2142   for his presence must be the whip of the other.
2143  *<S {Cap.G}.> In the meane time, what heare you of these
2144   Warres?
2145   <S {Cap.E}.> I heare there is an ouerture of peace.
2146   <S {Cap.G}.> Nay, I assure you a peace concluded.
2147  *<S {Cap.E}.> What will Count {Rossillion} do then? Will he
2148   trauaile higher, or returne againe into France?
2149  *<S {Cap.G}.> I perceiue by this demand, you are not alto-gether
2150   of his councell.
2151  *<S {Cap.E}.> Let it be forbid sir, so should I bee a great
2152   deale of his act.
2153  *<S {Cap.G}.> Sir, his wife some two months since fledde
2154  *from his house, her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint {Ia-ques}
2155  *{le grand}; which holy vndertaking, with most au-stere
2156  *sanctimonie she accomplisht: and there residing,
2157  *the tendernesse of her Nature, became as a prey to her
2158  *greefe: in fine, made a groane of her last breath, & now
2159   she sings in heauen.
2160   <S {Cap.E}.> How is this iustified?
2161  *<S {Cap.G}.> The stronger part of it by her owne Letters,
2162  *which makes her storie true, euen to the poynt of her
2163  *death: her death it selfe, which could not be her office
2164  *to say, is come: was faithfully confirm'd by the Rector
2165   of the place.
2166   <S {Cap.E}.> Hath the Count all this intelligence?
2167  *<S {Cap.G}.> #I, and the particular confirmations, point
2168   from point, to the full arming of the veritie.
2169  *<S {Cap.E}.> I am heartily sorrie that hee'l bee gladde of
2170   this.
2171  *<S {Cap.G}.> How mightily sometimes, we make vs com-forts
2172   of our losses.
2173  *<S {Cap.E}.> And how mightily some other times, wee
2174  *drowne our gaine in teares, the great dignitie that his
2175  *valour hath here acquir'd for him, shall at home be en-countred
2176   with a shame as ample.
2177  *<S {Cap.G}.> The webbe of our life, is of a mingled yarne,
2178  *good and #ill together: our vertues would bee proud, if
2179  *our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would dis-paire
2180   if they were not cherish'd by our vertues.
2181   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2182   How now? Where's your master?
2183  *<S {Ser}.> He met the Duke in the street sir, of whom hee
2184  *hath taken a solemne leaue: his Lordshippe will next
2185  *morning for France. The Duke hath offered him Let-ters
2186   of commendations to the King.
2187  *<S {Cap.E}.> They shall bee no more then needfull there,
2188   if they were more then they can commend.
2189   <D {Enter Count Rossillion}.>
2190  *<S {Ber}.> They cannot be too sweete for the Kings tart-nesse,
2191  *heere's his Lordship now. How now my Lord,
2192   i'st not after midnight?
2193  *<S {Ber}.> I haue to night dispatch'd sixteene businesses, a
2194  *moneths length #a peece, by an abstract of successe: I
2195  *haue congied with the Duke, done my adieu with his
2196  *neerest; buried a wife, mourn'd for her, writ to my La-die
2197  *mother, I am returning, entertain'd my Conuoy, &
2198  *betweene these maine parcels of dispatch, affected ma-ny
2199  *nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I haue
2200   not ended yet.
2201  *<S {Cap.E}.> If the businesse bee of any difficulty, and this
2202  *morning your departure hence, it requires #hast of your
2203   Lordship.
2204  *<S {Ber}.> I meane the businesse is not ended, as fearing
2205  *to heare of it hereafter: but shall we haue this dialogue
2206  *betweene the Foole and the Soldiour. Come, bring
2207  *forth this counterfet module, #ha's deceiu'd mee, like a
2208   double- meaning Prophesier.
2209  *<S {Cap.E}.> Bring him forth, #ha's sate i'th stockes all night
2210   poore gallant knaue.
2211  *<S {Ber}.> No matter, his heeles haue deseru'd it, in vsur-ping
2212  *his spurres so long. How does he carry himselfe?
2213  *<S {Cap.E}.> I haue told your Lordship alreadie: The
2214  *stockes carrie him. But to answer you as you would be
2215  *vnderstood, hee weepes like a wench that had shed her
2216  *milke, he hath confest himselfe to {Morgan}, whom hee
2217  *supposes to be a Friar, fro[m] the time of his remembrance
2218  *to this very instant disaster of his setting i'th stockes:
2219   and what thinke you he hath confest?
2220   <S {Ber}.> Nothing of me, ha's #a?
2221  *<S {Cap.E}.> His confession is taken, and it shall bee read
2222  *to his face, if your Lordshippe be in't, as I beleeue you
2223   are, you must haue the patience to heare it.
2224   <D {Enter Parolles with his Interpreter}.>
2225  *<S {Ber}.> A plague vpon him, muffeld; he can say nothing
2226   of me: hush, hush.
2227   <S {Cap.G}.> Hoodman comes: {Portotartarossa}.
2228   <S {Inter}.> He calles for the tortures, what will you say
2229   without em.
2230  *<S {Par}.> I will confesse what I know without constraint,
2231   If ye pinch me like a Pasty, I can say no more.
2232   <S {Int}.> {Bosko Chimurcho}.
2233   <S {Cap}.> {Boblibindo chicurmurco}.
2234  *<S {Int}.> You are a mercifull Generall: Our Generall
2235  *bids you answer to what I shall aske you out of a Note.
2236   <S {Par}.> And truly, as I hope to liue.
2237  *<S {Int}.> First demand of him, how many horse the Duke
2238   is strong. What say you to that?
2239  *<S {Par}.> Fiue or sixe thousand, but very weake and vn-seruiceable:
2240  *the troopes are all scattered, and the Com-manders
2241  *verie poore rogues, vpon my reputation and
2242   credit, and as I hope to liue.
2243   <S {Int}.> Shall I set downe your answer so?
2244  *<S {Par}.> Do, Ile take the Sacrament on't, how & which
2245   way you will: all's one to him.
2246   <S {Ber}.> What a past- sauing slaue is this?
2247  *<S {Cap.G}.> Y'are deceiu'd my Lord, this is Mounsieur
2248  *{Parrolles} the gallant militarist, that was his owne phrase
2249  *that had the whole theoricke of warre in the knot of his
2250   scarfe, and the practise in the chape of his dagger.
2251  *<S {Cap.E}.> I will neuer trust a man againe, for keeping
2252  *his sword cleane, nor beleeue he can haue euerie thing
2253   in him, by wearing his apparrell neatly.
2254   <S {Int}.> Well, that's set downe.
2255  *<S {Par}.> Fiue or six thousand horse I sed, I will say true,
2256   or thereabouts set downe, for Ile speake truth.
2257   <S {Cap.G}.> He's very neere the truth in this.
2258  *<S {Ber}.> But I con him no thankes for't in the nature he
2259   deliuers it.
2260   <S {Par}.> Poore rogues, I pray you say.
2261   <S {Int}.> Well, that's set downe.
2262  *<S {Par}.> I humbly thanke you sir, a truth's a truth, the
2263   Rogues are maruailous poore.
2264  *<S {Interp}.> Demaund of him of what strength they are #a
2265   foot. What say you to that?
2266  *<S {Par}.> By my troth sir, if I were to liue this present
2267  *houre, I will tell true. Let me see, {Spurio} a hundred &
      <P X4v>
2268  *fiftie, {Sebastian} so many, {Corambus} so many, {Iaques} so
2269  *many: {Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowicke}, and {Gratij}, two hun-dred
2270  *fiftie each: Mine owne Company, {Chitopher, Vau-mond},
2271  *{Bentij}, two hundred fiftie each: so that the muster
2272  *file, rotten and sound, vppon my life amounts not to fif-teene
2273  *thousand pole, halfe of the which, dare not shake
2274  *the snow from off their Cassockes, least they shake them-selues
2275   to peeces.
2276   <S {Ber}.> What shall be done to him?
2277  *<S {Cap.G}.> Nothing, but let him haue thankes. Demand
2278  *of him my condition: and what credite I haue with the
2279   Duke.
2280  *<S {Int}.> Well that's set downe: you shall demaund of
2281  *him, whether one Captaine {Dumaine} bee i'th Campe, a
2282  *Frenchman: what his reputation is with the Duke, what
2283  *his valour, honestie, and expertnesse in warres: or whe-ther
2284  *he thinkes it were not possible with well- waighing
2285  *summes of gold to corrupt him to a reuolt. What say you
2286   to this? What do you know of it?
2287  *<S {Par}.> I beseech you let me answer to the particular of
2288   the intergatories. Demand them singly.
2289   <S {Int}.> Do you know this Captaine {Dumaine}?
2290  *<S {Par}.> I know him, #a was a Botchers Prentize in {Paris},
2291  *from whence he was whipt for getting the Shrieues fool
2292  *with childe, a dumbe innocent that could not say him
2293   nay.
2294  *<S {Ber}.> Nay, by your leaue hold your hands, though I
2295   know his braines are forfeite to the next tile that fals.
2296  *<S {Int}.> Well, is this Captaine in the Duke of Florences
2297   campe?
2298   <S {Par}.> Vpon my knowledge he is, and lowsie.
2299  *<S {Cap.G}.> Nay looke not so vpon me: we shall heare of
2300   your Lord anon.
2301   <S {Int}.> What is his reputation with the Duke?
2302  *<S {Par}.> The Duke knowes him for no other, but a poore
2303  *Officer of mine, and writ to mee this other day, to turne
2304  *him out a'th band. I thinke I haue his Letter in my poc-ket.
2305  _
2306   <S {Int}.> Marry #we'll search.
2307  *<S {Par}.> In good sadnesse I do not know, either it is there,
2308  *or it is vpon a file with the Dukes other Letters, in my
2309   Tent.
2310  *<S {Int}.> Heere 'tis, heere's a paper, shall I reade it to you?
2311   <S {Par}.> I do not know if it be it or no.
2312   <S {Ber}.> Our Interpreter do's it well.
2313   <S {Cap.G}.> Excellently.
2314   <S {Int}.> {Dian, the Counts a foole, and full of gold}.
2315  *<S {Par}.> That is not the Dukes letter sir: that is an ad-uertisement
2316  *to a proper maide in Florence, one {Diana}, to
2317  *take heede of the allurement of one Count {Rossillion}, a
2318  *foolish idle boy: but for all that very ruttish. I pray you
2319   sir put it vp againe.
2320   <S {Int}.> Nay, Ile reade it first by your fauour.
2321  *<S {Par}.> My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the
2322  *behalfe of the maid: for I knew the young Count to be a
2323  *dangerous and lasciuious boy, who is a whale to Virgi-nity,
2324   and deuours vp all the fry it finds.
2325   <S {Ber}.> Damnable both- sides rogue.
2326  *<S {Int}.><D {Let}.> {When he sweares oathes, bid him drop gold, and}
2327   {take it:}
2328   {After he scores, he neuer payes the score:}
2329   {Halfe won is match well made, match and well make it},
2330   {He nere payes after- debts, take it before},
2331   {And say a souldier (Dian) told thee this:}
2332   {Men are to mell with, boyes are not to kis}.
2333   {For count of this, the Counts a Foole I know it},
2334   {Who payes before, but not when he does owe it}.
2335   Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine eare,
2336   {Parolles}.
2337  *<S {Ber}.> He shall be whipt through the Armie with this
2338   rime in's forehead.
2339  *<S {Cap.E}.> This is your deuoted friend sir, the manifold
2340   Linguist, and the army- potent souldier.
2341  *<S {Ber}.> I could endure  any thing before but a Cat, and
2342   now he's a Cat to me.
2343  *<S {Int}.> I perceiue sir by your Generals lookes, wee shall
2344   be faine to hang you.
2345  *<S {Par}.> My life sir in any case: Not that I am afraide to
2346  *dye, but that my offences beeing many, I would repent
2347  *out the remainder of Nature. Let me liue sir in a dunge-on,
2348   i'th stockes, or any where, so I may liue.
2349  *<S {Int}.> Wee'le see what may bee done, so you confesse
2350  *freely: therefore once more to this Captaine {Dumaine}:
2351  *you haue answer'd to his reputation with the Duke, and
2352   to his valour. What is his honestie?
2353  *<S {Par}.> He will steale sir an Egge out of a Cloister: for
2354  *rapes and rauishments he paralels {Nessus}. Hee professes
2355  *not keeping of oaths, in breaking em he is stronger then
2356  *{Hercules}. He will lye sir, with such volubilitie, that you
2357  *would thinke truth were a foole: drunkennesse is his best
2358  *vertue, for he will be swine- drunke, and in his sleepe he
2359  *does little harme, saue to his bed- cloathes about him:
2360  *but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I
2361  *haue but little more to say sir of his honesty, he ha's eue-rie
2362  *thing that an honest man should not haue; what an
2363   honest man should haue, he has nothing.
2364   <S {Cap.G}.> I begin to loue him for this.
2365  *<S {Ber}.> For this description of thine honestie? A pox
2366   vpon him for me, he's more and more a Cat.
2367   <S {Int}.> What say you to his expertnesse in warre?
2368  *<S {Par}.> Faith sir, #ha's led the drumme before the Eng-lish
2369  *Tragedians: to belye him I will not, and more of his
2370  *souldiership I know not, except in that Country, he had
2371  *the honour to be the Officer at a place there called {Mile- end},
2372  *to instruct for the doubling of files. I would doe the
2373   man what honour I can, but of this I am not certaine.
2374  *<S {Cap.G}.> He hath out- villain'd villanie so farre, that the
2375   raritie redeemes him.
2376   <S {Ber}.> A pox on him, he's a Cat still.
2377  *<S {Int}.> His qualities being at this poore price, I neede
2378   not to aske you, if Gold will corrupt him to reuolt.
2379  *<S {Par}.> Sir, for a Cardceue he will sell the fee- simple of
2380  *his saluation, the inheritance of it, and cut th' intaile from
2381  *all remainders, and a perpetuall succession for it perpe-tually.
2382  _
2383  *<S {Int}.> What's his Brother, the other Captain {Dumain}?
2384   <S {Cap.E}.> Why do's he aske him of me?
2385   <S {Int}.> What's he?
2386  *<S {Par}.> E'ne a Crow a'th same nest: not altogether so
2387  *great as the first in goodnesse, but greater a great deale in
2388  *euill. He excels his Brother for a coward, yet his Brother
2389  *is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreate hee out-runnes
2390  *any Lackey; marrie in comming on, hee ha's the
2391   Crampe.
2392  *<S {Int}.> If your life be saued, will you vndertake to betray
2393   the Florentine.
2394  *<S {Par}.> #I, and the Captaine of his horse, Count {Rossillion}.
2395  *<S {Int}.> Ile whisper with the Generall, and knowe his
2396   pleasure.
2397  *<S {Par}.> Ile no more drumming, a plague of all drummes,
2398  *onely to seeme to deserue well, and to beguile the suppo-sition
      <P X5>
2399  *of that lasciuious yong boy the Count, haue I run
2400  *into this danger: yet who would haue suspected an am-bush
2401   where I was taken?
2402  *<S {Int}.> There is no remedy sir, but you must dye: the
2403  *Generall sayes, you that haue so traitorously discouerd
2404  *the secrets of your army, and made such pestifferous re-ports
2405  *of men very nobly held, can serue the world for
2406  *no honest vse: therefore you must dye. Come heades-man,
2407   off with his head.
2408  *<S {Par}.> O Lord sir let me liue, or let me see my death.
2409  *<S {Int}.> That shall you, and take your leaue of all your
2410   friends:
2411   So, looke about you, know you any heere?
2412   <S {Count}.> Good morrow noble Captaine.
2413   <S {Lo.E}.> God blesse you Captaine {Parolles}.
2414   <S {Cap.G}.> God saue you noble Captaine.
2415  *<S {Lo.E}.> Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord
2416   {Lafew}? I am for {France}.
2417  *<S {Cap.G}.> Good Captaine will you giue me a Copy of
2418  *the sonnet you writ to {Diana} in behalfe of the Count
2419  *{Rossillion}, #and I were not a verie Coward, I'de compell
2420   it of you, but far you well.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2421  *<S {Int}.> You are vndone Captaine all but your scarfe,
2422   that has a knot on't yet.
2423   <S {Par}.> Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
2424  *<S {Inter}.> If you could finde out a Countrie where but
2425  *women were that had receiued so much shame, you
2426  *might begin an impudent Nation. Fare yee well sir, I
2427   am for {France} too, we shall speake of you there.  <D {Exit}>
2428   <S {Par}.> Yet am I thankfull: if my heart were great
2429   'Twould burst at this: Captaine Ile be no more,
2430   But I will eate, and drinke, and sleepe as soft
2431   As Captaine shall. Simply the thing I am
2432   Shall make me liue: who knowes himselfe a braggart
2433   Let him feare this; for it will come to passe,
2434   That euery braggart shall be found an Asse.
2435   Rust sword, coole blushes, and {Parrolles} liue
2436   Safest in shame: being fool'd, by fool'rie thriue;
2437   There's place and meanes for euery man aliue.
2438   Ile after them.  <D {Exit}.>
2439   <D {Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana}.>
2440   <S {Hel}.> That you may well perceiue I haue not
2441   wrong'd you,
2442   One of the greatest in the Christian world
2443   Shall be my suretie: for whose throne 'tis needfull
2444   Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneele.
2445   Time was, I did him a desired office
2446   Deere almost as his life, which gratitude
2447   Through flintie Tartars bosome would peepe forth,
2448   And answer thankes. I duly am inform'd,
2449   His grace is at {Marcellae}, to which place
2450   We haue conuenient conuoy: you must know
2451   I am supposed dead, the Army breaking,
2452   My husband hies him home, where heauen ayding,
2453   And by the leaue of my good Lord the King,
2454   Wee'l be before our welcome.
2455   <S {Wid}.> Gentle Madam,
2456   You neuer had a seruant to whose trust
2457   Your busines was more welcome.
2458   <S {Hel}.> Nor your Mistris
2459   Euer a friend, whose thoughts more truly labour
2460   To recompence your loue: Doubt not but heauen
2461   Hath brought me vp to be your daughters dower,
2462   As it hath fated her to be my motiue
2463   And helper to a husband. But O strange men,
2464   That can such sweet vse make of what they hate,
2465   When sawcie trusting of the cosin'd thoughts
2466   Defiles the pitchy night, so lust doth play
2467   With what it loathes, for that which is away,
2468   But more of this heereafter: you {Diana},
2469   Vnder my poore instructions yet must suffer
2470   Something in my behalfe.
2471   <S {Dia}.> Let death and honestie
2472   Go with your impositions, I am yours
2473   Vpon your #will to suffer.
2474   <S {Hel}.> Yet I pray you:
2475   But with the word the time will bring on summer,
2476   When Briars shall haue leaues as well as thornes,
2477   And be as sweet as sharpe: we must away,
2478   Our Wagon is prepar'd, and time reuiues vs,
2479   All's well that ends well, still the fines the Crowne;
2480   What ere the course, the end is the renowne.  <D {Exeunt}>
2481   <D {Enter Clowne, old Lady, and Lafew}.>
2482  *<S {Laf}.> No, no, no, your sonne was misled with a snipt
2483  *taffata fellow there, whose villanous saffron wold haue
2484  *made all the vnbak'd and dowy youth of a nation in his
2485  *colour: your daughter- in- law had beene aliue at this
2486  *houre, and your sonne heere at home, more aduanc'd
2487  *by the King, then by that red- tail'd humble #Bee I speak
2488   of.
2489  *<S {La}.> I would I had not knowne him, it was the death
2490  *of the most vertuous gentlewoman, that euer Nature
2491  *had praise for creating. If she had pertaken of my flesh
2492  *and cost mee the deerest groanes of a mother, I could
2493   not haue owed her a more rooted loue.
2494  *<S {Laf}.> Twas a good Lady, 'twas a good Lady. Wee
2495  *may picke a thousand sallets ere wee light on such ano-ther
2496   hearbe.
2497  *<S {Clo}.> Indeed sir she was the sweete Margerom of the
2498   sallet, or rather the hearbe of grace.
2499  *<S {Laf}.> They are not hearbes you knaue, they are nose- hearbes.
2500  _
2501  *<S {Clowne}.> I am no great {Nabuchadnezar} sir, I haue not
2502   much skill in grace.
2503  *<S {Laf}.> Whether doest thou professe thy selfe, a knaue
2504   or a foole?
2505  *<S {Clo}.> A foole sir at a womans seruice, and a knaue at a
2506   mans.
2507   <S {Laf}.> Your distinction.
2508  *<S {Clo}.> I would cousen the man of his wife, and do his
2509   seruice.
2510   <S {Laf}.> So you were a knaue at his seruice indeed.
2511  *<S {Clo}.> And I would giue his wife my bauble sir to doe
2512   her seruice.
2513  *<S {Laf}.> I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knaue
2514   and foole.
2515   <S {Clo}.> At your seruice.
2516   <S {Laf}.> No, no, no.
2517  *<S {Clo}.> Why sir, if I cannot serue you, I can serue as
2518   great a prince as you are.
2519   <S {Laf}.> Whose that, a Frenchman?
2520  *<S {Clo}.> Faith sir #a has an English maine, but his fisno-mie
2521   is more hotter in France then there.
2522   <S {Laf}.> What prince is that?
2523  *<S {Clo}.> The blacke prince sir, alias the prince of darke-nesse,
2524   alias the diuell.
2525  *<S {Laf}.> Hold thee there's my purse, I giue thee not this
2526  *to suggest thee from thy master thou talk'st #off, serue
2527   him still.
      <P X5v>
2528  *<S {Clo}.> I am a woodland fellow sir, that alwaies loued
2529  *a great fire, and the master I speak of euer keeps a good
2530  *fire, but sure he is the Prince of the world, let his No-bilitie
2531  *remaine in's Court. I am for the house with the
2532  *narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pompe to
2533  *enter: some that humble themselues may, but the ma-nie
2534  *will be too chill and tender, and theyle bee for the
2535  *flowrie way that leads to the broad gate, and the great
2536   fire.
2537  *<S {Laf}.> Go thy waies, I begin to bee #a wearie of thee,
2538  *and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
2539  *with thee. Go thy wayes, let my horses be wel look'd
2540   #too, without any trickes.
2541  *<S {Clo}.> If I put any trickes vpon em sir, they shall bee
2542  *Iades trickes, which are their owne right by the law of
2543   Nature.  <D {Exit}>
2544   <S {Laf}.> A shrewd knaue and an vnhappie.
2545  *<S {Lady}.> So #a is. My Lord that's gone made himselfe
2546  *much sport out of him, by his authoritie hee remaines
2547  *heere, which he thinkes is a pattent for his sawcinesse,
2548   and indeede he has no pace, but runnes where he will.
2549  *<S {Laf}.> I like him well, 'tis not amisse: and I was about
2550  *to tell you, since I heard of the good Ladies death, and
2551  *that my Lord your sonne was vpon his returne home. I
2552  *moued the King my master to speake in the behalfe of
2553  *my daughter, which in the minoritie of them both, his
2554  *Maiestie out of a selfe gracious remembrance did first
2555  *propose, his Highnesse hath promis'd me to doe it, and
2556  *to stoppe vp the displeasure he hath conceiued against
2557  *your sonne, there is no fitter matter. How do's your
2558   Ladyship like it?
2559  *<S {La}.> With verie much content my Lord, and I wish
2560   it happily effected.
2561  *<S {Laf}.> His Highnesse comes post from {Marcellus}, of as
2562  *able bodie as when he number'd thirty, #a will be heere
2563  *to morrow, or I am deceiu'd by him that in such intel-ligence
2564   hath seldome fail'd.
2565  *<S {La}.> It reioyces me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
2566  *die. I haue letters that my sonne will be heere to night:
2567  *I shall beseech your Lordship to remaine with mee, till
2568   they meete together.
2569  *<S {Laf}.> Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
2570   might safely be admitted.
2571  *<S {Lad}.> You neede but pleade your honourable priui-ledge.
2572  _
2573  *<S {Laf}.> Ladie, of that I haue made a bold charter, but
2574   I thanke my God, it holds yet.
2575   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
2576  *<S {Clo}.> O Madam, yonders my Lord your sonne with
2577  *a patch of veluet on's face, whether there bee a scar vn-der't
2578  *or no, the Veluet knowes, but 'tis a goodly patch
2579  *of Veluet, his left cheeke is a cheeke of two pile and a
2580   halfe, but his right cheeke is worne bare.
2581   <S {Laf}.> A scarre nobly got,
2582   Or a noble scarre, is a good liu'rie of honor,
2583   So belike is that.
2584   <S {Clo}.> But it is your carbinado'd face.
2585   <S {Laf}.> Let vs go see
2586   your sonne I pray you, I long to talke
2587   With the yong noble souldier.
2588  *<S {Clowne}.> 'Faith there's a dozen of em, with delicate
2589  *fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the

2591   <D {Exeunt}>
2592   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2593   <D {Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana, with}
2594   {two Attendants}.>
2595   <S {Hel}.> But this exceeding posting day and night,
2596   Must wear your spirits low, we cannot helpe it:
2597   But since you haue made the daies and nights as one,
2598   To weare your gentle limbes in my affayres,
2599   Be bold you do so grow in my requitall,
2600   As nothing can vnroote you. In happie time,
2601   <D {Enter a gentle Astringer}.>
2602   This man may helpe me to his Maiesties eare,
2603   If he would spend his power. God saue you sir.
2604   <S {Gent}.> And you.
2605   <S {Hel}.> Sir, I haue seene you in the Court of France.
2606   <S {Gent}.> I haue beene sometimes there.
2607   <S {Hel}.> I do presume sir, that you are not falne
2608   From the report that goes vpon your goodnesse,
2609   And therefore goaded with most sharpe occasions,
2610   Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
2611   The vse of your owne vertues, for the which
2612   I shall continue thankefull.
2613   <S {Gent}.> What's your #will?
2614   <S {Hel}.> That it will please you
2615   To giue this poore petition to the King,
2616   And ayde me with that store of power you haue
2617   To come into his presence.
2618   <S {Gen}.> The Kings not heere.
2619   <S {Hel}.> Not heere sir?
2620   <S {Gen}.> Not indeed,
2621   He hence remou'd last night, and with more #hast
2622   Then is his vse.
2623   <S {Wid}.> Lord how we loose our paines.
2624   <S {Hel}.> All's well that ends well yet,
2625   Though time seeme so aduerse, and meanes vnfit:
2626   I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
2627   <S {Gent}.> Marrie as I take it to {Rossillion},
2628   Whither I am going.
2629   <S {Hel}.> I do beseech you sir,
2630   Since you are like to see the King before me,
2631   Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
2632   Which I presume shall render you no blame,
2633   But rather make you thanke your paines for it,
2634   I will come after you with what good speede
2635   Our meanes will make vs meanes.
2636   <S {Gent}.> This Ile do for you.
2637  *<S {Hel}.> And you shall finde your selfe to be well thankt
2638  *what e're falles more. We must to horse againe, Go, go,
2639   prouide.
2640   <D {Enter Clowne and Parrolles}.>
2641  *<S {Par}.> Good Mr {Lauatch} giue my Lord {Lafew} this let-ter,
2642  *I haue ere now sir beene better knowne to you, when
2643  *I haue held familiaritie with fresher cloathes: but I am
2644  *now sir muddied in fortunes mood, and smell somewhat
2645   strong of her strong displeasure.
2646  *<S {Clo}.> Truely, Fortunes displeasure is but sluttish if it
2647  *smell so strongly as thou speak'st of: I will hencefoorth
2648  *eate no Fish of Fortunes butt'ring. Prethee alow the
2649   winde.
2650  *<S {Par}.> Nay you neede not to stop your nose sir: I spake
2651   but by a Metaphor.
2652  *<S {Clo}.> Indeed sir, if your Metaphor stinke, I will stop
2653  *my nose, or against any mans Metaphor. Prethe get thee
2654   further.
      <P X6>
2655   <S {Par}.> Pray you sir deliuer me this paper.
2656  *<S {Clo}.> Foh, prethee stand away: a paper from fortunes
2657  *close- stoole, to giue to a Nobleman. Looke heere he
2658   comes himselfe.
2659   <D {Enter Lafew}.>
2660  *<S {Clo}.> Heere is a purre of Fortunes sir, or of Fortunes
2661  *Cat, but not a Muscat, that ha's falne into the vncleane
2662  *fish- pond of her displeasure, and as he sayes is muddied
2663  *withall.   Pray you sir, vse the Carpe as you may, for he
2664  *lookes like a poore decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally
2665  *knaue. I doe pittie his distresse in my smiles of comfort,
2666   and leaue him to your Lordship.
2667  *<S {Par}.> My Lord I am a man whom fortune hath cruel-ly
2668   scratch'd.
2669  *<S {Laf}.> And what would you haue me to doe? 'Tis too
2670  *late to paire her nailes now. Wherein haue you played
2671  *the knaue with fortune that she should scratch you, who
2672  *of her selfe is a good Lady, and would not haue knaues
2673  *thriue long vnder? There's a Cardecue for you: Let the
2674  *Iustices make you and fortune friends; I am for other
2675   businesse.
2676  *<S {Par}.> I beseech your honour to heare mee one single
2677   word,
2678  *<S {Laf}.> you begge a single peny more: Come you shall
2679   ha't, saue your word.
2680   <S {Par}.> My name my good Lord is {Parrolles}.
2681  *<S {Laf}.> You begge more then word then. Cox my pas-sion,
2682   giue me your hand: How does your drumme?
2683  *<S {Par}.> O my good Lord, you were the first that found
2684   mee.
2685  *<S {Laf}.> Was I insooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
2686  *<S {Par}.> It lies in you my Lord to bring me in some grace
2687   for you did bring me out.
2688  *<S {Laf}.> Out vpon thee knaue, doest thou put vpon mee
2689  *at once both the office of God and the diuel: one brings
2690  *thee in grace, and the other brings thee out. The Kings
2691  *comming I know by his Trumpets. Sirrah, inquire fur-ther
2692  *after me, I had talke of you last night, though you
2693   are a foole and a knaue, you shall eate, go #too, follow.
2694   <S {Par}.> I praise God for you.
2695   <D {Flourish. Enter King, old Lady, Lafew, the two French}
2696   {Lords, with attendants}.>
2697   <S {Kin}.> We lost a Iewell of her, and our esteeme
2698   Was made much poorer by it: but your sonne,
2699   As mad in folly, lack'd the sence to know
2700   Her estimation home.
2701   <S {Old} {La}.> 'Tis past my Liege,
2702   And I beseech your Maiestie to make it
2703   Naturall rebellion, done i'th blade of youth,
2704   When oyle and fire, too strong for reasons force,
2705   Ore- beares it, and burnes on.
2706   <S {Kin}.> My honour'd Lady,
2707   I haue forgiuen and forgotten all,
2708   Though my reuenges were high bent vpon him,
2709   And watch'd the time to shoote.
2710   <S {Laf}.> This I must say,
2711   But first I begge my pardon: the yong Lord
2712   Did to his Maiesty, his Mother, and his Ladie,
2713   Offence of mighty note; but to himselfe
2714   The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife,
2715   Whose beauty did astonish the suruey
2716   Of richest eies: whose words all eares tooke captiue,
2717   Whose deere perfection, hearts that scorn'd to serue,
2718   Humbly call'd Mistris.
2719   <S {Kin}.> Praising what is lost,
2720   Makes the remembrance deere. Well, call him hither,
2721   We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
2722   All repetition: Let him not aske our pardon,
2723   The nature of his great offence is dead,
2724   And deeper then obliuion, we do burie
2725   Th' incensing  reliques of it. Let him approach
2726   A stranger,  no offender; and informe him
2727   So 'tis our #will he should.
2728   <S {Gent}.> I shall my Liege.
2729   <S {Kin}.> What sayes he to your daughter,
2730   Haue you spoke?
2731   <S {Laf}.> All that he is, hath reference to your Highnes.
2732  *<S {Kin}.> Then shall we haue a match. I haue letters sent
2733   me, that sets him high in fame.
2734   <D {Enter Count Bertram}.>
2735   <S {Laf}.> He lookes well on't.
2736   <S {Kin}.> I am not a day of season,
2737   For thou maist see a sun- shine, and a haile
2738   In me at once: But to the brightest beames
2739   Distracted clouds giue way, so stand thou forth,
2740   The time is faire againe.
2741   <S {Ber}.> My high repented blames
2742   Deere Soueraigne pardon to me.
2743   <S {Kin}.> All is whole,
2744   Not one word more of the consumed time,
2745   Let's take the instant by the forward top:
2746   For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
2747   Th' inaudible,  and noiselesse foot of time
2748   Steales, ere we can effect them. You remember
2749   The daughter of this Lord?
2750   <S {Ber}.> Admiringly my Liege, at first
2751   I stucke my choice vpon her, ere my heart
2752   Durst make too bold a herauld of my tongue:
2753   Where the impression of mine eye enfixing,
2754   Contempt his scornfull Perspectiue did lend me,
2755   Which warpt the line, of euerie other fauour,
2756   Scorn'd a faire colour, or exprest it stolne,
2757   Extended or contracted all proportions
2758   To a most hideous obiect. Thence it came,
2759   That she whom all men prais'd, and whom my selfe,
2760   Since I haue lost, haue lou'd; was in mine eye
2761   The dust that did offend it.
2762   <S {Kin}.> Well excus'd:
2763   That thou didst loue her, strikes some scores away
2764   From the great compt: but loue that comes too late,
2765   Like a remorsefull pardon slowly carried
2766   To the great sender, turnes a sowre offence,
2767   Crying, that's good that's gone: Our rash faults,
2768   Make triuiall price of serious things we haue,
2769   Not knowing them, vntill we know their graue.
2770   Oft our displeasures to our selues vniust,
2771   Destroy our friends, and after weepe their dust:
2772   Our owne loue waking, cries to see what's done,
2773   While shamefull hate sleepes out the afternoone.
2774   Be this sweet {Helens} knell, and now forget her.
2775   Send forth your amorous token for faire {Maudlin},
2776   The maine consents are had, and heere wee'l stay
2777   To see our widdowers second marriage day:
2778   Which better then the first, O deere heauen blesse,
2779   Or, ere they meete in me, O Nature cesse.
2780   <S {Laf}.> Come on my sonne, in whom my houses name
2781   Must be digested: giue a fauour from you
2782   To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
      <P X6v>
2783   That she may quickly come. By my old beard,
2784   And eu'rie haire that's on't, {Helen} that's dead
2785   Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
2786   The last that ere I tooke her leaue at Court,
2787   I saw vpon her finger.
2788   <S {Ber}.> Hers it was not.
2789   <S {King}.> Now pray you let me see it. For mine eye,
2790   While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd too't:
2791   This Ring was mine, and when I gaue it {Hellen},
2792   I bad her if her fortunes euer stoode
2793   Necessitied to helpe, that by this token
2794   I would releeue her. Had you that craft to reaue her
2795   Of what should stead her most?
2796   <S {Ber}.> My gracious Soueraigne,
2797   How ere it pleases you to take it so,
2798   The ring was neuer hers.
2799   <S {Old} {La}.> Sonne, on my life
2800   I haue seene her weare it, and she reckon'd it
2801   At her liues rate.
2802   <S {Laf}.> I am sure I saw her weare it.
2803   <S {Ber}.> You are deceiu'd my Lord, she neuer saw it:
2804   In Florence was it from a casement throwne mee,
2805   Wrap'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
2806   Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thought
2807   I stood ingag'd, but when I had subscrib'd
2808   To mine owne fortune, and inform'd her fully,
2809   I could not answer in that course of Honour
2810   As she had made the ouerture, she ceast
2811   In heauie satisfaction, and would neuer
2812   Receiue the Ring againe.
2813   <S {Kin}.> {Platus} himselfe,
2814   That knowes the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
2815   Hath not in natures mysterie more science,
2816   Then I haue in this Ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas {Helens},
2817   Who euer gaue it you: then if you know
2818   That you are well acquainted with your selfe,
2819   Confesse 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
2820   You got it from her. She call'd the Saints to suretie,
2821   That she would neuer put it from her finger,
2822   Vnlesse she gaue it to your selfe in bed,
2823   Where you haue neuer come: or sent it vs
2824   Vpon her great disaster.
2825   <S {Ber}.> She neuer saw it.
2826  *<S {Kin}.> Thou speak'st it falsely: as I loue mine Honor,
2827   And mak'st connecturall feares to come into me,
2828   Which I would faine shut out, if it should proue
2829   That thou art so inhumane, 'twill not proue so:
2830   And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly,
2831   And she is dead, which nothing but to close
2832   Her eyes my selfe, could win me to beleeue,
2833   More then to see this Ring. Take him away,
2834   My fore- past proofes, how ere the matter fall
2835   Shall taze my feares of little vanitie,
2836   Hauing vainly fear'd too little. Away with him,
2837   Wee'l sift this matter further.
2838   <S {Ber}.> If you shall proue
2839   This Ring was euer hers, you shall as easie
2840   Proue that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
2841   Where yet she neuer was.
2842   <D {Enter a Gentleman}.>
2843   <S {King}.> I am wrap'd in dismall thinkings.
2844   <S {Gen}.> Gracious Soueraigne.
2845   Whether I haue beene #too blame or no, I know not,
2846   Here's a petition from a Florentine,
2847   Who hath for foure or fiue remoues come short,
2848   To tender it her selfe. I vndertooke it,
2849   Vanquish'd thereto by the faire grace and speech
2850   Of the poore suppliant, who by this I know
2851   Is heere attending: her businesse lookes in her
2852   With an importing visage, and she told me
2853   In a sweet verball breefe, it did concerne
2854   Your Highnesse  with her selfe.
2855   <D {A Letter}.>
2856  *{Vpon his many protestations to marrie mee when his wife was}
2857  *{dead, I blush to say it, he wonne me. Now is the Count Ros-sillion}
2858  *{a Widdower, his vowes are forfeited to mee, and my}
2859  *{honors payed to him. Hee stole from Florence, taking no}
2860  *{leaue, and I follow him to his Countrey for Iustice: Grant}
2861  *{it me, O King, in you it best lies, otherwise a seducer flou-rishes},
2862   {and a poore Maid is vndone}.
2863   Diana Capilet.
2864  *<S {Laf}.> I will buy me a sonne in Law in a faire, and toule
2865   for this. Ile none of him.
2866   <S {Kin}.> The heauens haue thought well on thee {Lafew},
2867   To bring forth this discou'rie, seeke these sutors:
2868   Go speedily, and bring againe the Count.
2869   <D {Enter Bertram}.>
2870   I am a- feard the life of {Hellen} (Ladie)
2871   Was fowly snatcht.
2872   <S {Old} {La}.> Now iustice on the doers.
2873   <S {King}.> I wonder sir, sir, wiues are monsters to you,
2874   And that you flye them as you sweare them Lordship,
2875   Yet you desire to marry. What woman's that?
2876   <D {Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles}.>
2877   <S {Dia}.> I am my Lord a wretched Florentine,
2878   Deriued from the ancient Capilet,
2879   My suite as I do vnderstand you know,
2880   And therefore know how farre I may be pittied.
2881   <S {Wid}.> I am her Mother sir, whose age and honour
2882   Both suffer vnder this complaint we bring,
2883   And both shall cease, without your remedie.
2884  *<S {King}.> Come hether Count, do you know these Wo-men?
2885  _
2886   <S {Ber}.> My Lord, I neither can nor will denie,
2887   But that I know them, do they charge me further?
2888  *<S {Dia}.> Why do you looke so strange vpon your wife?
2889   <S {Ber}.> She's none of mine my Lord.
2890   <S {Dia}.> If you shall marrie
2891   You giue away this hand, and that is mine,
2892   You giue away heauens vowes, and those are mine:
2893   You giue away my selfe, which is knowne mine:
2894   For I by vow am so embodied yours,
2895   That she which marries you, must marrie me,
2896   Either both or none.
2897  *<S {Laf}.> Your reputation comes too short for my daugh-ter,
2898   you are no husband for her.
2899  *<S {Ber}.> My Lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature,
2900  *Whom sometime I haue laugh'd with: Let your highnes
2901   Lay a more noble thought vpon mine honour,
2902   Then for to thinke that I would sinke it heere.
2903  *<S {Kin}.> Sir for my thoughts, you haue them #il to friend,
2904   Till your deeds gaine them fairer: proue your honor,
2905   Then in my thought it lies.
2906   <S {Dian}.> Good my Lord,
2907   Aske him vpon his oath, if hee do's thinke
2908   He had not my virginity.
2909   <S {Kin}.> What saist thou to her?
2910   <S {Ber}.> She's impudent my Lord,
2911   And was a common gamester to the Campe.
2912   <S {Dia}.> He do's me wrong my Lord: If I were so,
2913   He might haue bought me at a common price.
      <P Y1>
2914   Do not beleeue him. O behold this Ring,
2915   Whose high respect and rich validitie
2916   Did lacke a Paralell: yet for all that
2917   He gaue it to a Commoner a'th Campe
2918   If I be one.
2919   <S {Coun}.> He blushes, and 'tis hit:
2920   Of sixe preceding Ancestors that Iemme
2921   Confer'd by testament to'th sequent issue
2922   Hath it beene owed and worne. This is his wife,
2923   That Ring's a thousand proofes.
2924   <S {King}.> Me thought you saide
2925   You saw one heere in Court could witnesse it.
2926   <S {Dia}.> I did my Lord, but loath am to produce
2927   So bad an instrument, his names {Parrolles}.
2928   <S {Laf}.> I saw the man to day, if man he bee.
2929   <S {Kin}.> Finde him, and bring him hether.
2930   <S {Ros}.> What of him:
2931   He's quoted for a most perfidious slaue
2932   With all the spots a'th world, taxt and debosh'd,
2933   Whose nature sickens: but to speake a truth,
2934   Am I, or that or this for what he'l vtter,
2935   That will speake any thing.
2936   <S {Kin}.> She hath that Ring of yours.
2937   <S {Ros}.> I thinke she has; certaine it is I lyk'd her,
2938   And boorded her i'th wanton way of youth:
2939   She knew her distance, and did angle for mee,
2940   Madding my eagernesse with her restraint,
2941   As all impediments in fancies course
2942   Are motiues of more fancie, and in fine,
2943   Her insuite comming with her moderne grace,
2944   Subdu'd me to her rate, she got the Ring,
2945   And I had that which any inferiour might
2946   At Market price haue bought.
2947   <S {Dia}.> I must be patient:
2948   You that haue turn'd off a first so noble wife,
2949   May iustly dyet me. I pray you yet,
2950   (Since you lacke vertue, I will loose a husband)
2951   Send for your Ring, I will returne it home,
2952   And giue me mine againe.
2953   <S {Ros}.> I haue it not.
2954   <S {Kin}.> What Ring was yours I pray you?
2955   <S {Dian}.> Sir much like the same vpon your finger.
2956   <S {Kin}.> Know you this Ring, this Ring was his of late.
2957   <S {Dia}.> And this was it I gaue him being #a bed.
2958   <S {Kin}.> The story then goes false, you threw it him
2959   Out of a Casement.
2960   <S {Dia}.> I haue spoke the truth.  <D {Enter Parolles}.>
2961   <S {Ros}.> My Lord, I do confesse the ring was hers.
2962  *<S {Kin}.> You boggle shrewdly, euery feather starts you:
2963   Is this the man you speake of?
2964   <S {Dia}.> #I, my Lord.
2965   <S {Kin}.> Tell me sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,
2966   Not fearing the displeasure of your master:
2967   Which on your iust proceeding, Ile keepe off,
2968   By him and by this woman heere, what know you?
2969  *<S {Par}.> So please your Maiesty, my master hath bin an
2970  *honourable Gentleman. Trickes hee hath had in him,
2971   which Gentlemen haue.
2972  *<S {Kin}.> Come, come, to'th' purpose:  Did hee loue this
2973   woman?
2974   <S {Par}.> Faith sir he did loue her, but how.
2975   <S {Kin}.> How I pray you?
2976   <S {Par}.> He did loue her sir, as a Gent. loues a Woman.
2977   <S {Kin}.> How is that?
2978   <S {Par}.> He lou'd her sir, and lou'd her not.
2979  *<S {Kin}.> As thou art a knaue and no knaue, what an equi-uocall
2980   Companion is this?
2981   <S {Par}.> I am a poore man, and at your Maiesties com-mand.
2982  _
2983  *<S {Laf}.> Hee's a good drumme my Lord, but a naughtie
2984   Orator.
2985   <S {Dian}.> Do you know he promist me marriage?
2986   <S {Par}.> Faith I  know more then Ile speake.
2987   <S {Kin}.> But wilt thou not speake all thou know'st?
2988  *<S {Par}.> Yes so please your Maiesty: I did goe betweene
2989  *them as I said, but more then that he loued her, for in-deede
2990  *he was madde for her, and talkt of Sathan, and of
2991  *Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in
2992  *that credit with  them at that time, that I knewe of their
2993  *going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her
2994  *marriage, and things which would deriue mee #ill #will to
2995   speake of, therefore I will not speake what I know.
2996  *<S {Kin}.> Thou hast spoken all alreadie, vnlesse thou canst
2997  *say they are maried, but thou art too fine in thy euidence,
2998   therefore stand aside. This Ring you say was yours.
2999   <S {Dia}.> #I  my good Lord.
3000   <S {Kin}.> Where did you buy it? Or who gaue it you?
3001   <S {Dia}.> It was not giuen me, nor I did not buy it.
3002   <S {Kin}.> Who lent it you?
3003   <S {Dia}.> It was not lent me neither.
3004   <S {Kin}.> Where did you finde it then?
3005   <S {Dia}.> I found it not.
3006   <S {Kin}.> If it were yours by none of all these wayes,
3007   How could you giue it him?
3008   <S {Dia}.> I neuer gaue it him.
3009  *<S {Laf}.> This womans an easie gloue my Lord, she goes
3010   off and on at pleasure.
3011   <S {Kin}.> This Ring was mine,  I gaue it his first wife.
3012   <S {Dia}.> It might be yours or hers for ought I know.
3013   <S {Kin}.> Take her away, I do not like her now,
3014   To prison with her: and away with him,
3015   Vnlesse thou telst me where thou hadst this Ring,
3016   Thou diest within this houre.
3017   <S {Dia}.> Ile neuer tell you.
3018   <S {Kin}.> Take her away.
3019   <S {Dia}.> Ile put in baile my liedge.
3020   <S {Kin}.> I thinke thee now some common Customer.
3021   <S {Dia}.> By Ioue if euer I knew man 'twas you.
3022  *<S {King}.> Wherefore hast thou accusde him al this while.
3023   <S {Dia}.> Because he's guiltie, and he is not guilty:
3024   He knowes I am no Maid, and hee'l sweare too't:
3025   Ile sweare I am a Maid, and he knowes not.
3026   Great King I am no strumpet, by my life,
3027   I am either Maid, or else this old mans wife.
3028   <S {Kin}.> She does abuse our eares, to prison with her.
3029   <S {Dia}.> Good mother fetch my bayle. Stay Royall sir,
3030   The Ieweller that owes the Ring is sent for,
3031   And he shall surety me. But for this Lord,
3032   Who hath abus'd me as he knowes himselfe,
3033   Though yet he neuer harm'd me, heere I quit him.
3034   He knowes himselfe  my bed he hath defil'd,
3035   And at that time he got his wife with childe:
3036   Dead though she be, she feeles her yong one kicke:
3037   So there's my riddle, one that's dead is quicke,
3038   And now behold the meaning.
3039   <D {Enter Hellen and Widdow}.>
3040   <S {Kin}.> Is there no exorcist
3041   Beguiles the truer Office of mine eyes?
3042   Is't reall that I see?
3043   <S {Hel}.> No my good Lord,
      <P Y1v>
3044   'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
3045   The name, and not the thing.
3046   <S {Ros}.> Both, both, O pardon.
3047  *<S {Hel}.> Oh my good Lord, when I was like this Maid,
3048   I found you wondrous kinde, there is your Ring,
3049   And looke you, heeres your letter: this it sayes,
3050   When from my finger you can get this Ring,
3051   And is by me with childe, &c. This is done,
3052   Will you be mine now you are doubly wonne?
3053  *<S {Ros}.> If she my Liege can make me know this clearly,
3054   Ile loue her dearely, euer, euer dearly.
3055   <S {Hel}.> If it appeare not plaine, and proue vntrue,
3056   Deadly diuorce step betweene me and you.
3057   O my deere mother do I see you liuing?
3058   <S {Laf}.> Mine eyes smell Onions, I shall weepe anon:
3059   Good Tom Drumme lend me a handkercher.
3060  *So I thanke thee, waite on me home, Ile make sport with
3061   thee: Let thy curtsies alone, they are scuruy ones.
3062   <S {King}.> Let vs from point to point this storie know,
3063   To make the euen truth in pleasure flow:
3064   If thou beest yet a fresh vncropped flower,
3065   Choose thou thy husband, and Ile pay thy dower.
3066   For I can guesse, that by thy honest ayde,
3067   Thou keptst a wife her selfe, thy selfe a Maide.
3068   Of that and all the progresse more and lesse,
3069   Resoluedly more leasure shall expresse:
3070   All yet seemes well, and if it end so meete,
3071   The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
3072   <D {Flourish}.>
3073   {The Kings a Begger, now the Play is done},
3074   {All is well ended, if this suite be wonne},
3075   {That you expresse Content: which we will pay},
3076   {With strife to please you, day exceeding day:}
3077   {Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts},
3078  *{Your gentle hands lend vs, and take our hearts}.  <D Exeunt omn.>
3079   <Z FINIS.
3080   ALL'S
3081   Well, that Ends Well.>
