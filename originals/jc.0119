5     *Hence: home you idle Creatures, get you home:
6      Is this a Holiday? What, know you not
7      (Being Mechanicall) you ought not walke
8      Vpon a labouring day, without the signe
9      Of your Profession? Speake, what Trade art thou?
10     <S {Car}.> Why Sir, a Carpenter.
11     <S {Mur}.> Where is thy Leather Apron, and thy Rule?
12     What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on?
13     You sir, what Trade are you?
14    *<S {Cobl}.> Truely Sir, in respect of a fine Workman, I am
15     but as you would say, a Cobler.
16    *<S {Mur}.> But what Trade art thou? Answer me directly.
17    *<S {Cob}.> A Trade Sir, that I hope I may vse, with a safe
18    *Conscience, which is indeed Sir, a Mender of bad soules.
19    *<S {Fla}.> What Trade thou knaue? Thou naughty knaue,
20     what Trade?
21    *<S {Cobl}.> Nay I beseech you Sir, be not out with me: yet
22     if you be out Sir, I can mend you.
23    *<S {Mur}.> What mean'st thou by that? Mend mee, thou
24     sawcy Fellow?
25     <S {Cob}.> Why sir, Cobble you.
26     <S {Fla}.> Thou art a Cobler, art thou?
27    *<S {Cob}.> Truly sir, all that I liue by, is with the Aule: I
28    *meddle with no Tradesmans matters, nor womens mat-ters;
29    *but withal I am indeed Sir, a Surgeon to old shooes:
30    *when they are in great danger, I recouer them. As pro-per
31    *men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather, haue gone vp-on
32     my handy- worke.
33     <S {Fla}.> But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day?
34     Why do'st thou leade these men about the streets?
35    *<S {Cob}.> Truly sir, to weare out their shooes, to get my
36    *selfe into more worke. But indeede sir, we make Holy-day
37    *to see {Caesar}, and to reioyce in his Triumph.
38     <S {Mur}.> Wherefore reioyce?
39     What Conquest brings he home?
40     What Tributaries follow him to Rome,
41     To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles?
42    *You Blockes, you stones, you worse then senslesse things:
43     O you hard hearts, you cruell men of Rome,
44     Knew you not {Pompey} many a time and oft?
45     Haue you climb'd vp to Walles and Battlements,
46     To Towres and Windowes? Yea, to Chimney tops,
47     Your Infants in your Armes, and there haue sate
48     The liue- long day, with patient expectation,
49     To see great {Pompey} passe the streets of Rome:
50     And when you saw his Chariot but appeare,
51     Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout,
52     That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes
53     To heare the replication of your sounds,
54     Made in her Concaue Shores?
55     And do you now put on your best attyre?
56     And do you now cull out a Holyday?
57     And do you now strew Flowers in his way,
58     That comes in Triumph ouer {Pompeyes} blood?
59     Be gone,
60     Runne to your houses, fall vpon your knees,
61     Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague
62     That needs must light on this Ingratitude.
63     <S {Fla}.> Go, go, good Countrymen, and for this fault
64     Assemble all the poore men of your sort;
65     Draw them to Tyber bankes, and weepe your teares
66     Into the Channell, till the lowest streame
67     Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all.
68     <D {Exeunt all the Commoners}.>
69     See where their basest mettle be not mou'd,
70     They vanish tongue- tyed in their guiltinesse:
71     Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll,
72     This way will I: Disrobe the Images,
73     If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies.
74     <S {Mur}.> May we do so?
75     You know it is the Feast of Lupercall.
76     <S {Fla}.> It is no matter, let no Images
77     Be hung with {Caesars} Trophees: Ile about,
78     And driue away the Vulgar from the streets;
79     So do you too, where you perceiue them thicke.
80     These growing Feathers, pluckt from {Caesars} wing,
81     Will make him flye an ordinary pitch,
82     Who else would soare aboue the view of men,
83     And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse.  <D {Exeunt}>
84    *<D {Enter Caesar, Antony for the Course, Calphurnia, Portia, De-cius},

87     <S {Caes}.> {Calphurnia}.
88     <S {Cask}.> Peace ho, {Caesar} speakes.
89     <S {Caes}.> {Calphurnia}.
90     <S {Calp}.> Heere my Lord.
91     <S {Caes}.> Stand you directly in {Antonio's} way,
92     When he doth run his course. {Antonio}.
93     <S {Ant}.> {Caesar}, my Lord.
94     <S {Caes}.> Forget not in your speed {Antonio},
95     To touch {Calphurnia}: for our Elders say,
      <P kk1v>
96     The Barren touched in this holy chace,
97     Shake off their sterrile curse.
98     <S {Ant}.> I shall remember,
99     When {Caesar} sayes, Do this; it is perform'd.
100    <S {Caes}.> Set on, and leaue no Ceremony out.
101    <S {Sooth}.> {Caesar}.
102    <S {Caes}.> Ha? Who calles?
103    <S {Cask}.> Bid euery noyse be still: peace yet againe.
104    <S {Caes}.> Who is it in the presse, that calles on me?
105    I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke
106    Cry, {Caesar}: Speake, {Caesar} is turn'd to heare.
107    <S {Sooth}.> Beware the Ides of March.
108    <S {Caes}.> What man is that?
109   *<S {Br}.> A Sooth- sayer bids you beware the Ides of March
110    <S {Caes}.> Set him before me, let me see his face.
111   *<S {Cassi}.> Fellow, come from the throng, look vpon {Caesar}.
112   *<S {Caes}.> What sayst thou to me now? Speak once againe,
113    <S {Sooth}.> Beware the Ides of March.
114    <S {Caes}.> He is a Dreamer, let vs leaue him: Passe.
115    <D {Sennet}>.  <D {Exeunt. Manet Brut. & Cass}.>
116    <S {Cassi}.> Will you go see the order of the course?
117    <S {Brut}.> Not I.
118    <S {Cassi}.> I pray you do.
119    <S {Brut}.> I am not Gamesom: I do lacke some part
120    Of that quicke Spirit that is in {Antony}:
121    Let me not hinder {Cassius} your desires;
122    Ile leaue you.
123    <S {Cassi}.> {Brutus}, I do obserue you now of late:
124    I haue not from your eyes, that gentlenesse
125    And shew of Loue, as I was wont to haue:
126    You beare too stubborne, and too strange a hand
127    Ouer your Friend, that loues you.
128    <S {Bru}.> {Cassius},
129    Be not deceiu'd: If I haue veyl'd my looke,
130    I turne the trouble of my Countenance
131    Meerely vpon my selfe. Vexed I am
132    Of late, with passions of some difference,
133    Conceptions onely proper to my selfe,
134    Which giue some soyle (perhaps) to my Behauiours:
135    But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu'd
136    (Among which number {Cassius} be you one)
137    Nor construe any further my neglect,
138    Then that poore {Brutus} with himselfe at warre,
139    Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men.
140   *<S {Cassi}.> Then {Brutus}, I haue much mistook your passion,
141    By meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried
142    Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations.
143    Tell me good {Brutus}, Can you see your face?
144    <S {Brutus}.> No {Cassius}:
145    For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection,
146    By some other things.
147    <S {Cassius}.> 'Tis iust,
148    And it is very much lamented {Brutus},
149    That you haue no such Mirrors, as will turne
150    Your hidden worthinesse into your eye,
151    That you might see your shadow:
152    I haue heard,
153    Where many of the best respect in Rome,
154    (Except immortall {Caesar}) speaking of {Brutus},
155    And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake,
156    Haue wish'd, that Noble {Brutus} had his eyes.
157    <S {Bru}.> Into what dangers, would you
158    Leade me {Cassius}?
159    That you would haue me seeke into my selfe,
160    For that which is not in me?
161    <S {Cas}.> Therefore good {Brutus}, be prepar'd to heare:
162    And since you know, you cannot see your selfe
163    So well as by Reflection; I your Glasse,
164    Will modestly discouer to your selfe
165    That of your selfe, which you yet know not of.
166    And be not iealous on me, gentle {Brutus}:
167    Were I a common Laughter, or did vse
168    To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue
169    To euery new Protester: if you know,
170    That I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard,
171    And after scandall them: Or if you know,
172    That I professe my selfe in Banquetting
173    To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous.
174    <D {Flourish, and Shout}.>
175    <S {Bru}.> What meanes this Showting?
176    I do feare, the People choose {Caesar}
177    For their King.
178    <S {Cassi}.> #I, do you feare it?
179    Then must I thinke you would not haue it so.
180    <S {Bru}.> I would not {Cassius}, yet I loue him well:
181    But wherefore do you hold me heere so long?
182    What is it, that you would impart to me?
183    If it be ought toward the generall good,
184    Set Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other,
185    And I will looke on both indifferently:
186    For let the Gods so speed mee, as I loue
187    The name of Honor, more then I feare death.
188    <S {Cassi}.> I know that vertue to be in you {Brutus},
189    As well as I do know your outward fauour.
190    Well, Honor is the subiect of my Story:
191    I cannot tell, what you and other men
192    Thinke of this life: But for my single selfe,
193    I had as liefe not be, as liue to be
194    In awe of such a Thing, as I my selfe.
195    I was borne free as {Caesar}, so were you,
196    We both haue fed as well, and we can both
197    Endure the Winters cold, as well as hee.
198    For once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day,
199    The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores,
200    {#Caesar} saide to me, Dar'st thou {Cassius} now
201    Leape in with me into this angry Flood,
202    And swim to yonder Point? Vpon the word,
203    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
204    And bad him follow: so indeed he did.
205    The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
206    With lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside,
207    And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie.
208    But ere we could arriue the Point propos'd,
209    {#Caesar} cride, Helpe me {Cassius}, or I sinke.
210    I (as {Aeneas}, our great Ancestor,
211    Did from the Flames of Troy, vpon his shoulder
212    The old {Anchyses} beare) so, from the waues of Tyber
213    Did I the tyred {Caesar}: And this Man,
214    Is now become a God, and {Cassius} is
215    A wretched Creature, and must bend his body,
216    If {Caesar} carelesly but nod on him.
217    He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine,
218    And when the Fit was on him, I did marke
219    How he did shake: Tis true, this God did shake,
220    His Coward lippes did from their colour flye,
221    And that same Eye, whose bend doth awe the World,
222    Did loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone:
223    #I, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans
224    Marke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes,
225    Alas, it cried, Giue me some drinke {Titinius},
      <P kk2>
226    As a sicke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,
227    A man of such a feeble temper should
228    So get the start of the Maiesticke world,
229    And beare the Palme alone.
230    <D {Shout.  Flourish}.>
231    <S {Bru}.> Another generall shout?
232    I do beleeue, that these applauses are
233    For some new Honors, that are heap'd on {Caesar}.
234    <S {Cassi}.> Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world
235    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
236    Walke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about
237    To finde our selues dishonourable Graues.
238    Men at sometime, are Masters of their Fates.
239    The fault (deere {Brutus})  is not in our Starres,
240    But in our Selues, that we are vnderlings.
241    {#Brutus} and {Caesar}: What should be in that {Caesar}?
242    Why should that name be sounded more then yours
243    Write them together: Yours, is as faire a Name:
244    Sound them, it doth become the mouth aswell:
245    Weigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em,
246    {#Brutus} will start a Spirit as soone as {Caesar}.
247    Now in the names of all the Gods at once,
248    Vpon what meate doth this our {Caesar} feede,
249    That he is growne so great? Age, thou art sham'd.
250    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods.
251    When went there by an Age, since the great Flood,
252    But it was fam'd with more then with one man?
253    When could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome,
254    That her wide Walkes incompast but one man?
255    Now is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough
256    When there is in it but one onely man.
257    O! you and I, haue heard our Fathers say,
258    There was a {Brutus} once, that would haue brook'd
259    Th' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome,
260    As easily as a King.
261    <S {Bru}.> That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous:
262    What you would worke me #too, I haue some ayme:
263    How I haue thought of this, and of these times
264    I shall recount heereafter. For this present,
265    I would not so (with loue I might intreat you)
266    Be any further moou'd: What you haue said,
267    I will consider: what you haue to say
268    I will with patience heare, and finde a time
269    Both meete to heare, and answer such high things.
270    Till then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this:
271    {#Brutus} had rather be a Villager,
272    Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome
273    Vnder these hard Conditions, as this time
274    Is like to lay vpon vs.
275    <S {Cassi}.> I am glad that my weake words
276    Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from {Brutus},
277    <D {Enter Caesar and his Traine}.>
278    <S {Bru}.> The Games are done,
279    And {Caesar} is returning.
280    <S {Cassi}.> As they passe by,
281    Plucke {Caska} by the Sleeue,
282    And he will (after his sowre fashion) tell you
283    What hath proceeded worthy note to day.
284    <S {Bru}.> I will do so: but looke you {Cassius},
285    The angry spot doth glow on {Caesars} brow,
286    And all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine;
287    {Calphurnia's} Cheeke is pale, and {Cicero}
288    Lookes with such Ferret, and such fiery eyes
289    As we haue seene him in the Capitoll
290    Being crost in Conference, by some Senators.
291    <S {Cassi}.> {Caska} will tell vs what the matter is.
292    <S {Caes}.> {Antonio}.
293    <S {Ant}.> {Caesar}.
294    <S {Caes}.> Let me haue men about me, that are fat,
295    Sleeke- headed men, and such as sleepe a- nights:
296    Yond {Cassius} has a leane and hungry looke,
297    He thinkes too much: such men are dangerous.
298    <S {Ant}.> Feare him not {Caesar}, he's not dangerous,
299    He is a Noble Roman, and well giuen.
300    <S {Caes}.> Would he were fatter; But I feare him not:
301    Yet if my name were lyable to feare,
302    I do not know the man I should auoyd
303    So soone as that spare {Cassius}. He reades much,
304    He is a great Obseruer, and he lookes
305    Quite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes,
306    As thou dost {Antony}: he heares no Musicke;
307    Seldome he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
308    As if he mock'd himselfe, and scorn'd his spirit
309    That could be mou'd to smile at any thing.
310    Such men as he, be neuer at hearts ease,
311    Whiles they behold a greater then themselues,
312    And therefore are they very dangerous.
313    I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd,
314    Then what I feare: for alwayes I am {Caesar}.
315    Come on my right hand, for this eare is deafe,
316    And tell me truely, what thou think'st of him.  <D {Sennit}.>
317    <D {Exeunt Caesar and his Traine}.>
318   *<S {Cask}.> You pul'd me by the cloake, would you speake
319    with me?
320    <S {Bru}.> #I {Caska}, tell vs what hath chanc'd to day
321    That {Caesar} lookes so sad.
322    <S {Cask}.> Why you were with him, were you not?
323   *<S {Bru}.> I should not then aske {Caska} what had chanc'd.
324   *<S {Cask}.> Why there was a Crowne offer'd him; & being
325   *offer'd him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus,
326    and then the people fell #a shouting.
327    <S {Bru}.> What was the second noyse for?
328    <S {Cask}.> Why for that too.
329   *<S {Cassi}.> They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
330    <S {Cask}.> Why for that too.
331    <S {Bru}.> Was the Crowne offer'd him thrice?
332   *<S {Cask}.> #I marry #was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie
333   *time gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine
334    honest Neighbors showted.
335    <S {Cassi}.> Who offer'd him the Crowne?
336    <S {Cask}.> Why {Antony}.
337    <S {Bru}.> Tell vs the manner of it, gentle {Caska}.
338   *<S {Caska}.> I can as well bee hang'd as tell the manner of
339   *it: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I sawe
340   *{Marke Antony} offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a
341   *Crowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I
342   *told you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thin-king,
343   *he would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to
344   *him againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my think-ing,
345   *he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then
346   *he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by,
347   *and still as hee refus'd it, the rabblement howted, and
348   *clapp'd their chopt hands, and threw vppe their sweatie
349   *Night- cappes, and vttered such a deale of stinking
350   *breath, because {Caesar} refus'd the Crowne, that it had
351   *(almost) choaked {Caesar}: for hee swoonded, and fell
352   *downe at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh,
353   *for feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad
354    Ayre.
      <P kk2v><C A>
355    <S {Cassi}.> But soft I pray you: what, did {Caesar} swound?
356   *<S {Cask}.> He fell downe in the Market- place, and foam'd
357    at mouth, and was speechlesse.
358    <S {Brut}.> 'Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse.
359    <S {Cassi}.> No, {Caesar} hath it not: but you, and I,
360    And honest {Caska}, we haue the Falling sicknesse.
361   *<S {Cask}.> I know not what you meane by that, but I am
362   *sure {Caesar} fell downe. If the tag- ragge people did not
363   *clap him, and hisse him, according as he pleas'd, and dis-pleas'd
364   *them, as they vse to doe the Players in the Thea-tre,
365    I am no true man.
366    <S {Brut}.> What said he, when he came vnto himselfe?
367   *<S {Cask}.> Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu'd
368   *the common Heard was glad he refus'd the Crowne, he
369   *pluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat
370   *to cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I
371   *would not haue taken him at a word, I would I might
372   *goe to #Hell among the Rogues, and so hee fell. When
373   *he came to himselfe againe, hee said, If hee had done, or
374   *said any thing amisse, he desir'd their Worships to thinke
375   *it was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I
376   *stood, cryed, Alasse good Soule, and forgaue him with
377   *all their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them;
378   *if {Caesar} had stab'd their Mothers, they would haue done
379    no lesse.
380    <S {Brut}.> And after that, he came thus sad away.
381    <S {Cask}.> #I.
382    <S {Cassi}.> Did {Cicero} say any thing?
383    <S {Cask}.> #I, he spoke Greeke.
384    <S {Cassi}.> To what effect?
385   *<S {Cask}.> Nay, #and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you
386   *i'th' face againe. But those that vnderstood him, smil'd
387   *at one another, and shooke their heads: but for mine
388   *owne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more
389   *newes too: {Murrellus} and {Flauius}, for pulling Scarffes
390   *off {Caesars} Images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
391   *There was more Foolerie yet, if I could remem-ber
392    it.
393    <S {Cassi}.> Will you suppe with me to Night, {Caska}?
394    <S {Cask}.> No, I am promis'd forth.
395    <S {Cassi}.> Will you Dine with me to morrow?
396   *<S {Cask}.> #I, if I be aliue, and your minde hold, and your
397    Dinner worth the eating.
398    <S {Cassi}.> Good, I will expect you.
399    <S {Cask}.> Doe so: farewell both.  <D {Exit}.>
400    <S {Brut}.> What a blunt fellow is this growne to be?
401    He was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole.
402    <S {Cassi}.> So is he now, in execution
403    Of any bold, or Noble Enterprize,
404    How- euer he puts on this tardie forme:
405    This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit,
406    Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words
407    With better Appetite.
408    <S {Brut}.> And so it is:
409    For this time I will leaue you:
410    To morrow, if you please to speake with me,
411    I will come home to you: or if you will,
412    Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
413    <S {Cassi}.> I will doe so: till then, thinke of the World.
414    <D {Exit Brutus}.>
415    Well {Brutus}, thou art Noble: yet I see,
416    Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought
417    From that it is dispos'd: therefore it is meet,
418    That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes:
419    For who so firme, that cannot be seduc'd?
420    {#Caesar} doth beare me hard, but he loues {Brutus}.
421    If I were {Brutus} now, and he were {Cassius},
422    He should not humor me. I will this Night,
423    In seuerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw,
424    As if they came from seuerall Citizens,
425    Writings, all tending to the great opinion
426    That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely
427    {Caesars} Ambition shall be glanced at.
428    And after this, let {Caesar} seat him sure,
429    For wee will shake him, or worse dayes endure.
430    <D {Exit}.>
431    <D {Thunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska},
432    {and Cicero}.>
433    <S {Cic}.> Good euen, {Caska}: brought you {Caesar} home?
434    Why are you breathlesse, and why stare you so?
435   *<S {Cask}.> Are not you mou'd, when all the sway of Earth
436    Shakes, like a thing vnfirme? O {Cicero},
437    I haue seene Tempests, when the scolding Winds
438    Haue riu'd the knottie Oakes, and I haue seene
439    Th' ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foame,
440    To be exalted with the threatning Clouds:
441    But neuer till to Night, neuer till now,
442    Did I goe through a Tempest- dropping- fire.
443    Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen,
444    Or else the World, too sawcie with the Gods,
445    Incenses them to send destruction.
446    <S {Cic}.> Why, saw you any thing more wonderfull?
447   *<S {Cask}.> A common slaue, you know him well by sight,
448    Held vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne
449    Like twentie Torches ioyn'd; and yet his Hand,
450    Not sensible of fire, remain'd vnscorch'd.
451    Besides, I #ha' not since put vp my Sword,
452    Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon,
453    Who glaz'd vpon me, and went surly by,
454    Without annoying me. And there were drawne
455    Vpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women,
456    Transformed with their feare, who swore, they saw
457    Men, all in fire, walke vp and downe the streetes.
458    And yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit,
459    Euen at Noone- day, vpon the Market place,
460    Howting, and shreeking. When these Prodigies
461    Doe so conioyntly meet, let not men say,
462    These are their Reasons, they are Naturall:
463    For I beleeue, they are portentous things
464    Vnto the Clymate, that they point vpon.
465    <S {Cic}.> Indeed, it is a strange disposed time:
466    But men may construe things after their fashion,
467    Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues.
468    Comes {Caesar} to the Capitoll to morrow?
469    <S {Cask}.> He doth: for he did bid {Antonio}
470    Send word to you, he would be there to morrow.
471    <S {Cic}.> Good- night then, {Caska}:
472    This disturbed Skie is not to walke in.
473    <S {Cask}.> Farewell {Cicero}.  <D {Exit Cicero}.>
474    <D {Enter Cassius}.>
475    <S {Cassi}.> Who's there?
476    <S {Cask}.> A Romane.
477    <S {Cassi}.> {Caska}, by your Voyce.
478    <S {Cask}.> Your Eare is good.
479    {#Cassius}, what Night is this?
480    <S {Cassi}.> A very pleasing Night to honest men.
481    <S {Cask}.> Who euer knew the Heauens menace so?
482   *<S {Cassi}.> Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of
483    faults.
      <P kk3>
484    For my part, I haue walk'd about the streets,
485    Submitting me vnto the perillous Night;
486    And thus vnbraced, {Caska}, as you see,
487    Haue bar'd my Bosome to the Thunder- stone:
488    And when the crosse blew Lightning seem'd to open
489    The Brest of Heauen, I did present my selfe
490    Euen in the ayme, and very flash of it.
491   *<S {Cask}.> But wherefore did you so much tempt the Hea-|(uens?
492    It is the part of men, to feare and tremble,
493    When the most mightie Gods, by tokens send
494    Such dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs.
495    <S {Cassi}.> You are dull, {Caska}:
496    And those sparkes of Life, that should be in a Roman,
497    You doe want, or else you vse not.
498    You looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare,
499    And cast your selfe in wonder,
500    To see the strange impatience of the Heauens:
501    But if you would consider the true cause,
502    Why all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts,
503    Why Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde,
504    Why Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate,
505    Why all these things change from their Ordinance,
506    Their Natures, and pre- formed Faculties,
507    To monstrous qualitie; why you shall finde,
508    That Heauen hath infus'd them with these Spirits,
509    To make them Instruments of feare, and warning,
510    Vnto some monstrous State.
511    Now could I ({Caska}) name to thee a man,
512    Most like this dreadfull Night,
513    That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares,
514    As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll:
515    A man no mightier then thy selfe, or me,
516    In personall action; yet prodigious growne,
517    And fearefull, as these strange eruptions are.
518    <S {Cask}.> 'Tis {Caesar} that you meane:
519    Is it not, {Cassius}?
520    <S {Cassi}.> Let it be who it is: for Romans now
521    Haue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors;
522    But woe the while, our Fathers mindes are dead,
523    And we are gouern'd with our Mothers spirits,
524    Our yoake, and sufferance, shew vs Womanish.
525    <S {Cask}.> Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow
526    Meane to establish {Caesar} as a King:
527    And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land,
528    In euery place, saue here in Italy.
529    <S {Cassi}.> I know where I will weare this Dagger then;
530    {#Cassius} from Bondage will deliuer {#Cassius}:
531    Therein, yee Gods, you make the weake most strong;
532    Therein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat.
533    Nor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Brasse,
534    Nor ayre- lesse Dungeon, nor strong Linkes of Iron,
535    Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit:
536    But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres,
537    Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe.
538    If I know this, know all the World besides,
539    That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare,
540    I can shake off at pleasure.  <D {Thunder still}.>
541    <S {Cask}.> So can I:
542    So euery Bond- man in his owne hand beares
543    The power to cancell his Captiuitie.
544    <S {Cassi}.> And why should {Caesar} be a Tyrant then?
545    Poore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe,
546    But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe:
547    He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes.
548    Those that with haste will make a mightie fire,
549    Begin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome?
550    What Rubbish, and what Offall? when it serues
551    For the base matter, to illuminate
552    So vile a thing as {Caesar}. But oh Griefe,
553    Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speake this
554    Before a willing Bond- man: then I know
555    My answere must be made. But I am arm'd,
556    And dangers are to me indifferent.
557    <S {Cask}.> You speake to {Caska}, and to such a man,
558    That is no flearing Tell- tale. Hold, my Hand:
559    Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes,
560    And I will set this foot of mine as farre,
561    As who goes farthest.
562    <S {Cassi}.> There's a Bargaine made.
563    Now know you, {Caska}, I haue mou'd already
564    Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans
565    To vnder- goe, with me, an Enterprize,
566    Of Honorable dangerous consequence;
567    And I doe know by this, they stay for me
568    In {Pompeyes} Porch: for now this fearefull Night,
569    There is no stirre, or walking in the streetes;
570    And the Complexion of the Element
571    Is Fauors, like the Worke we haue in hand,
572    Most bloodie, fierie, and most terrible.
573    <D {Enter Cinna}.>
574   *<S {Caska}.> Stand close #a while, for heere comes one in
575    haste.
576    <S {Cassi}.> 'Tis {Cinna}, I doe know him by his Gate,
577    He is a friend. {Cinna}, where haste you so?
578   *<S {Cinna}.> To finde out you: Who's that, {Metellus}
579    {Cymber}?
580    <S {Cassi}.> No, it is {Caska}, one incorporate
581    To our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for, {Cinna}?
582    <S {Cinna}.> I am glad on't.
583    What a fearefull Night is this?
584    There's two or three of vs haue seene strange sights.
585    <S {Cassi}.> Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
586    <S {Cinna}.> Yes, you are. O {Cassius},
587    If you could but winne the Noble {Brutus}
588    To our party===
589    <S {Cassi}.> Be you content. Good {Cinna}, take this Paper,
590    And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre,
591    Where {Brutus} may but finde it: and throw this
592    In at his Window; set this vp with Waxe
593    Vpon old {Brutus} Statue: all this done,
594    Repaire to {Pompeyes} Porch, where you shall finde vs.
595    Is {Decius Brutus} and {Trebonius} there?
596    <S {Cinna}.> All, but {Metellus Cymber}, and hee's gone
597    To seeke you at your house. Well, I will hie,
598    And so bestow these Papers as you bad me.
599    <S {Cassi}.> That done, repayre to {Pompeyes} Theater.
600    <D {Exit Cinna}.>
601    Come {Caska}, you and I will yet, ere day,
602    See {Brutus} at his house: three parts of him
603    Is ours alreadie, and the man entire
604    Vpon the next encounter, yeelds him ours.
605    <S {Cask}.> O, he sits high in all the Peoples hearts:
606    And that which would appeare Offence in vs,
607    His Countenance, like richest Alchymie,
608    Will change to Vertue, and to Worthinesse.
609    <S {Cassi}.> Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,
610    You haue right well conceited: let vs goe,
611    For it is after Mid- night, and ere day,
612    We will awake him, and be sure of him.
613    <D {Exeunt}.>
      <P kk3v>
614    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
615    <D {Enter Brutus in his Orchard}.>
616    <S {Brut}.> What {Lucius}, hoe?
617    I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres,
618    Giue guesse how neere to day=== {Lucius}, I say?
619    I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly.
620    When {Lucius}, when? awake, I say: what {Lucius}?
621    <D {Enter Lucius}.>
622    <S {Luc}.> Call'd you, my Lord?
623    <S {Brut}.> Get me a Tapor in my Study, {Lucius}:
624    When it is lighted, come and call me here.
625    <S {Luc}.> I will, my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
626    <S {Brut}.> It must be by his death: and for my part,
627    I know no personall cause, to spurne at him,
628    But for the generall. He would be crown'd:
629    How that might change his nature, there's the question?
630    It is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder,
631    And that craues warie walking: Crowne him that,
632    And then I graunt we put a Sting in him,
633    That at his #will he may doe danger with.
634    Th' abuse of Greatnesse, is, when it dis- ioynes
635    Remorse from Power: And to speake truth of {Caesar},
636    I haue not knowne, when his Affections sway'd
637    More then his Reason. But 'tis a common proofe,
638    That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder,
639    Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face:
640    But when he once attaines the vpmost Round,
641    He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe,
642    Lookes in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees
643    By which he did ascend: so {Caesar} may;
644    Then least he may, preuent. And since the Quarrell
645    Will beare no colour, for the thing he is,
646    Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
647    Would runne to these, and these extremities:
648    And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge,
649    Which hatch'd, would as his kinde grow mischieuous;
650    And kill him in the shell.
651    <D {Enter Lucius}.>
652    <S {Luc}.> The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir:
653    Searching the Window for a Flint, I found
654    This Paper, thus seal'd vp, and I am sure
655    It did not lye there when I went to Bed.
656    <D {Giues him the Letter}.>
657    <S {Brut}.> Get you to Bed againe, it is not day:
658    Is not to morrow (Boy) the first of March?
659    <S {Luc}.> I know not, Sir.
660    <S {Brut}.> Looke in the Calender, and bring me word.
661    <S {Luc}.> I will, Sir.  <D {Exit}.>
662    <S {Brut}.> The exhalations, whizzing in the ayre,
663    Giue so much light, that I may reade by them.
664    <D {Opens the Letter, and reades}.>
665    {Brutus thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy selfe:}
666    {Shall Rome, &c. speake, strike, redresse}.
667    {#Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake}.
668    Such instigations haue beene often dropt,
669    Where I haue tooke them vp:
670    {Shall Rome, &c}. Thus must I piece it out:
671    Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe? What Rome?
672    My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome
673    The {Tarquin} driue, when he was call'd a King.
674    {Speake, strike, redresse}. Am I entreated
675    To speake, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
676    If the redresse will follow, thou receiuest
677    Thy full Petition at the hand of {Brutus}.
678    <D {Enter Lucius}.>
679    <S {Luc}.> Sir, March is wasted fifteene dayes.
680    <D {Knocke within}.>
681   *<S {Brut}.> 'Tis good. Go to the Gate, some body knocks:
682    Since {Cassius} first did whet me against {Caesar},
683    I haue not slept.
684    Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing,
685    And the first motion, all the {Interim} is
686    Like a {Phantasma}, or a hideous Dreame:
687    The {Genius}, and the mortall Instruments
688    Are then in councell; and the state of a man,
689    Like to a little Kingdome, suffers then
690    The nature of an Insurrection.
691    <D {Enter Lucius}.>
692    <S {Luc}.> Sir, 'tis your Brother {Cassius} at the Doore,
693    Who doth desire to see you.
694    <S {Brut}.> Is he alone?
695    <S {Luc}.> No, Sir, there are moe with him.
696    <S {Brut}.> Doe you know them?
697    <S {Luc}.> No, Sir, their Hats are pluckt about their Eares,
698    And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes,
699    That by no meanes I may discouer them,
700    By any marke of fauour.
701    <S {Brut}.> Let 'em enter:
702    They are the Faction. O Conspiracie,
703    Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night,
704    When euills are most free? O then, by day
705    Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough,
706   *To maske thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracie,
707    Hide it in Smiles, and Affabilitie:
708    For if thou path thy natiue semblance on,
709    Not {Erebus} it selfe were dimme enough,
710    To hide thee from preuention.
711    <D {Enter the Conspirators, Cassius, Caska, Decius},
712    {Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonius}.>
713    <S {Cass}.> I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest:
714    Good morrow {Brutus}, doe we trouble you?
715    <S {Brut}.> I haue beene vp this howre, awake all Night:
716    Know I these men, that come along with you?
717    <S {Cass}.> Yes, euery man of them; and no man here
718    But honors you: and euery one doth wish,
719    You had but that opinion of your selfe,
720    Which euery Noble Roman beares of you.
721    This is {Trebonius}.
722    <S {Brut}.> He is welcome hither.
723    <S {Cass}.> This, {Decius Brutus}.
724    <S {Brut}.> He is welcome too.
725   *<S {Cass}.> This, {Caska}; this, {Cinna}; and this, {Metellus}
726    {Cymber}.
727    <S {Brut}.> They are all welcome.
728    What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues
729    Betwixt your Eyes, and Night?
730    <S {Cass}.> Shall I entreat a word?  <D {They whisper}.>
731   *<S {Decius}.> Here lyes the East: doth not the Day breake
732    heere?
733    <S {Cask}.> No.
734    <S {Cin}.> O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey Lines,
735    That fret the Clouds, are Messengers of Day.
736   *<S {Cask}.> You shall confesse, that you are both deceiu'd:
737    Heere, as I point my Sword, the Sunne arises,
738    Which is a great way growing on the South,
      <P kk4><C B>
739    Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare.
740    Some two moneths hence, vp higher toward the North
741    He first presents his fire, and the high East
742    Stands as the Capitoll, directly heere.
743    <S {Bru}.> Giue me your hands all ouer, one by one.
744    <S {Cas}.> And let vs sweare our Resolution.
745    <S {Brut}.> No, not an Oath: if not the Face of men,
746    The sufferance of our Soules, the times Abuse;
747    If these be Motiues weake, breake off betimes,
748    And euery man hence, to his idle bed:
749    So let high- sighted- Tyranny range on,
750    Till each man drop by Lottery. But if these
751    (As I am sure they do) beare fire enough
752    To kindle Cowards, and to steele with valour
753    The melting Spirits of women. Then Countrymen,
754    What neede we any spurre, but our owne cause
755    To pricke vs to redresse? What other Bond,
756    Then secret Romans, that haue spoke the word,
757    And will not palter? And what other Oath,
758    Then Honesty to Honesty ingag'd,
759    That this shall be, or we will fall for it.
760    Sweare Priests and Cowards, and men Cautelous
761    Old feeble Carrions, and such suffering Soules
762    That welcome wrongs: Vnto bad causes, sweare
763    Such Creatures as men doubt; but do not staine
764    The euen vertue of our Enterprize,
765    Nor th' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits,
766    To thinke, that or our Cause, or our Performance
767    Did neede an Oath. When euery drop of blood
768    That euery Roman beares, and Nobly beares
769    Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie,
770    If he do breake the smallest Particle
771    Of any promise that hath past from him.
772    <S {Cas}.> But what of {Cicero}? Shall we sound him?
773    I thinke he will stand very strong with vs.
774    <S {Cask}.> Let vs not leaue him out.
775    <S {Cyn}.> No, by no meanes.
776    <S {Metel}.> O let vs haue him, for his Siluer haires
777    Will purchase vs a good opinion:
778    And buy mens voyces, to commend our deeds:
779    It shall be sayd, his iudgement rul'd our hands,
780    Our youths, and wildenesse, shall no whit appeare,
781    But all be buried in his Grauity.
782    <S {Bru}.> O name him not; let vs not breake with him,
783    For he will neuer follow any thing
784    That other men begin.
785    <S {Cas}.> Then leaue him out.
786    <S {Cask}.> Indeed, he is not fit.
787    <S {Decius}.> Shall no man else be toucht, but onely {Caesar}?
788    <S {Cas}.> {Decius} well vrg'd: I thinke it is not meet,
789    {Marke Antony}, so well belou'd of {Caesar},
790    Should out- liue {Caesar}, we shall finde of him
791    A shrew'd Contriuer. And you know, his meanes
792    If he improue them, may well stretch so farre
793    As to annoy vs all: which to preuent,
794    Let {Antony} and {Caesar} fall together.
795    <S {Bru}.> Our course will seeme too bloody, {Caius Cassius},
796    To cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes:
797    Like Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards:
798    For {Antony}, is but a Limbe of {Caesar}.
799    Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers {Caius}:
800    We all stand vp against the spirit of {Caesar},
801    And in the Spirit of men, there is no blood:
802    O that we then could come by {Caesars} Spirit,
803    And not dismember {Caesar}! But (alas)
804    {#Caesar} must bleed for it. And gentle Friends,
805    Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully:
806    Let's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods,
807    Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds:
808    And let our Hearts, as subtle Masters do,
809    Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage,
810    And after seeme to chide 'em. This shall make
811    Our purpose Necessary, and not Enuious.
812    Which so appearing to the common eyes,
813    We shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers.
814    And for {Marke Antony}, thinke not of him:
815    For he can do no more then {Caesars} Arme,
816    When {Caesars} head is off.
817    <S {Cas}.> Yet I feare him,
818    For in the ingrafted loue he beares to {Caesar}.
819    <S {Bru}.> Alas, good {Cassius}, do not thinke of him:
820    If he loue {Caesar}, all that he can do
821    Is to himselfe; take thought, and dye for {Caesar},
822    And that were  much he should: for he is giuen
823    To sports, to wildenesse, and much company.
824    <S {Treb}.> There is no feare in him; let him not dye,
825    For he will liue, and laugh at this heereafter.
826    <D {Clocke strikes}.>
827    <S {Bru}.> Peace, count the Clocke.
828    <S {Cas}.> The Clocke hath stricken three.
829    <S {Treb}.> 'Tis time to part.
830    <S {Cass}.> But it is doubtfull yet,
831    Whether {Caesar} will come forth to day, or no:
832    For he is Superstitious growne of late,
833    Quite from the maine Opinion he held once,
834    Of Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies:
835    It may be, these apparant Prodigies,
836    The vnaccustom'd Terror of this night,
837    And the perswasion of his Augurers,
838    May hold him from the Capitoll to day.
839    <S {Decius}.> Neuer feare that: If he be so resolu'd,
840    I can ore- sway him: For he loues to heare,
841    That Vnicornes may be betray'd with Trees,
842    And Beares with Glasses, Elephants with Holes,
843    Lyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers.
844    But, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers,
845    He sayes, he does; being then most flattered.
846    Let me worke:
847    For I can giue his humour the true bent;
848    And I will bring him to the Capitoll.
849    <S {Cas}.> Nay, we will all of vs, be there to fetch him.
850    <S {Bru}.> By the eight houre, is that the vttermost?
851    <S {Cin}.> Be that the vttermost, and faile not then.
852    <S {Met}.> {Caius Ligarius} doth beare {Caesar} hard,
853    Who rated him for speaking well of {Pompey};
854    I wonder none of you haue thought of him.
855    <S {Bru}.> Now good {Metellus} go along by him:
856    He loues me well, and I haue giuen him Reasons,
857    Send him but hither, and Ile fashion him.
858    <S {Cas}.> The morning comes vpon's:
859    Wee'l leaue you {Brutus},
860    And Friends disperse your selues; but all remember
861   *What you haue said, and shew your selues true Romans.
862    <S {Bru}.> Good Gentlemen, looke fresh and merrily,
863    Let not our lookes put on our purposes,
864    But beare it as our Roman Actors do,
865    With vntyr'd Spirits, and formall Constancie,
866    And so good morrow to you euery one.  <D {Exeunt}.>
867    <D {Manet Brutus}.>
868    Boy: {Lucius}: Fast asleepe? It is no matter,
869    Enioy the hony- heauy- Dew of Slumber:
870    Thou hast no Figures, nor no Fantasies,
      <P kk4v>
871    Which busie care drawes, in the braines of men;
872    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
873    <D {Enter Portia}.>
874    <S {Por}.> {Brutus}, my Lord.
875   *<S {Bru}.> {Portia}: What meane you? wherfore rise you now?
876    It is not for your health, thus to commit
877    Your weake condition, to the raw cold morning.
878   *<S {Por}.> Nor for yours neither. Y'haue vngently {Brutus}
879    Stole from my bed: and yesternight at Supper
880    You sodainly arose, and walk'd about,
881    Musing, and sighing, with your armes a-crosse
882    And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
883    You star'd vpon me, with vngentle lookes.
884    I vrg'd you further, then you scratch'd your head,
885    And too impatiently stampt with your foote:
886    Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
887    But with an angry wafter of your hand
888    Gaue signe for me to leaue you: So I did,
889    Fearing to strengthen that impatience
890    Which seem'd too much inkindled; and withall,
891    Hoping it was but an effect of Humor,
892    Which sometime hath his houre with euery man.
893    It will not let you eate, nor talke, nor sleepe;
894    And could it worke so much vpon your shape,
895    As it hath much preuayl'd on your Condition,
896    I should not know you {Brutus}. Deare my Lord,
897    Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe.
898    <S {Bru}.> I am not well in health, and that is all.
899    <S {Por}.> {Brutus} is wise, and were he not in health,
900    He would embrace the meanes to come by it.
901    <S {Bru}.> Why so I do: good {Portia} go to bed.
902    <S {Por}.> Is {Brutus} sicke? And is it Physicall
903    To walke vnbraced, and sucke vp the humours
904    Of the danke Morning? What, is {Brutus} sicke?
905    And will he steale out of his wholsome bed
906    To dare the vile contagion of the Night?
907    And tempt the Rhewmy, and vnpurged Ayre,
908    To adde vnto his sicknesse? No my {Brutus},
909    You haue some sicke Offence within your minde,
910    Which by the Right and Vertue of my place
911    I ought to know of: And vpon my knees,
912    I charme you, by my once commended Beauty,
913    By all your vowes of Loue, and that great Vow
914    Which did incorporate and make vs one,
915    That you vnfold to me, your selfe; your halfe
916    Why you are heauy: and what men to night
917    Haue had resort to you: for heere haue beene
918    Some sixe or seuen, who did hide their faces
919    Euen from darknesse.
920    <S {Bru}.> Kneele not gentle {Portia}.
921    <S {Por}.> I should not neede, if you were gentle {Brutus}.
922    Within the Bond of Marriage, tell me {Brutus},
923    Is it excepted, I should know no Secrets
924    That appertaine to you? Am I your Selfe,
925    But as it were in sort, or limitation?
926    To keepe with you at Meales, comfort your Bed,
927   *And talke to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs
928    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
929    {Portia} is {Brutus} Harlot, not his Wife.
930    <S {Bru}.> You are my true and honourable Wife,
931    As deere to me, as are the ruddy droppes
932    That visit my sad heart.
933   *<S {Por}.> If this were true, then should I know this secret.
934    I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
935    A Woman that Lord {Brutus} tooke to Wife:
936    I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
937    A Woman well reputed: {Cato's} Daughter.
938    Thinke you, I am no stronger then my Sex
939    Being so Father'd, and so Husbanded?
940    Tell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
941    I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie,
942    Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound
943    Heere, in the Thigh: Can I beare that with patience,
944    And not my Husbands Secrets?
945    <S {Bru}.> O ye Gods!
946    Render me worthy of this Noble Wife.  <D {Knocke}.>
947    Harke, harke, one knockes: {Portia} go in #a while,
948    And #by and by thy bosome shall partake
949    The secrets of my Heart.
950    All my engagements, I will construe to thee,
951    All the Charractery of my sad browes:
952    Leaue me with #hast.  <D {Exit Portia}.>
953    <D {Enter Lucius and Ligarius}.>
954    {#Lucius}, who's that knockes.
955   *<S {Luc}.> Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you.
956    <S {Bru}.> {Caius Ligarius}, that {Metellus} spake of.
957    Boy, stand aside. {Caius Ligarius}, how?
958   *<S {Cai}.> Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
959    <S {Bru}.> O what a time haue you chose out braue {Caius}
960    To weare a Kerchiefe? Would you were not sicke.
961    <S {Cai}.> I am not sicke, if {Brutus} haue in hand
962    Any exploit worthy the name of Honor.
963    <S {Bru}.> Such an exploit haue I in hand {Ligarius},
964    Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it.
965    <S {Cai}.> By all the Gods that Romans bow before,
966    I heere discard my sicknesse. Soule of Rome,
967    Braue Sonne, deriu'd from Honourable Loines,
968    Thou like an Exorcist, hast coniur'd vp
969    My mortified Spirit. Now bid me runne,
970    And I will striue with things impossible,
971    Yea get the better of them. What's to do?
972    <S {Bru}.> A peece of worke,
973    That will make sicke men whole.
974   *<S {Cai}.> But are not some whole, that we must make sicke?
975    <S {Bru}.> That must we also. What it is my {Caius},
976    I shall vnfold to thee, as we are going,
977    To whom it must be done.
978    <S {Cai}.> Set on your foote,
979    And with a heart new- fir'd, I follow you,
980    To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
981    That {Brutus} leads me on.  <D {Thunder}>
982    <S {Bru}.> Follow me then.  <D {Exeunt}>
983    <D {Thunder & Lightning}>.
984    <D {Enter Iulius Caesar in his Night- gowne}.>
985    <S {Caesar}.> Nor Heauen, nor Earth,
986    Haue beene at peace to night:
987    Thrice hath {Calphurnia}, in her sleepe cryed out,
988    Helpe, ho: They murther {Caesar}. Who's within?
989    <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
990    <S {Ser}.> My Lord.
991    <S {Caes}.> Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice,
992    And bring me their opinions of Successe.
993    <S {Ser}.> I will my Lord.  <D {Exit}>
994    <D {Enter Calphurnia}.>
995   *<S {Cal}.> What mean you {Caesar}? Think you to walk forth?
996    You shall not stirre out of your house to day.
997   *<S {Caes}.> {Caesar} shall forth; the things that threaten'd me,
998    Ne're look'd but on my backe: When they shall see
999    The face of {Caesar}, they are vanished.
      <P kk5>
1000   <S {Calp}.> {Caesar}, I neuer stood on Ceremonies,
1001   Yet now they fright me: There is one within,
1002   Besides the things that we haue heard and seene,
1003   Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch.
1004   A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets,
1005   And Graues haue yawn'd, and yeelded vp their dead;
1006   Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds
1007   In Rankes and Squadrons, and right forme of Warre
1008   Which drizel'd blood vpon the Capitoll:
1009   The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre:
1010   Horsses do neigh, and dying men did grone,
1011   And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets.
1012   O {Caesar}, these things are beyond all vse,
1013   And I do feare them.
1014   <S {Caes}.> What can be auoyded
1015   Whose end is purpos'd by the mighty Gods?
1016   Yet {Caesar} shall go forth: for these Predictions
1017   Are to the world in generall, as to {Caesar}.
1018  *<S {Calp}.> When Beggers dye, there are no Comets seen,
1019  *The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes
1020   <S {Caes}.> Cowards dye many times before their deaths,
1021   The valiant neuer taste of death but once:
1022   Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard,
1023   It seemes to me most strange that men should feare,
1024   Seeing that death, a necessary end
1025   Will come, when it will come.
1026   <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
1027   What say the Augurers?
1028  *<S {Ser}.> They would not haue you to stirre forth to day.
1029   Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth,
1030   They could not finde a heart within the beast.
1031   <S {Caes}.> The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice:
1032   {#Caesar} should be a Beast without a heart
1033   If he should stay at home to day for feare:
1034   No {Caesar} shall not; Danger knowes full well
1035   That {Caesar} is more dangerous then he.
1036   We heare two Lyons litter'd in one day,
1037   And I the elder and more terrible,
1038   And {Caesar} shall go foorth.
1039   <S {Calp}.> Alas my Lord,
1040   Your wisedome is consum'd in confidence:
1041   Do not go forth to day: Call it my feare,
1042   That keepes you in the house, and not your owne.
1043   Wee'l send {Mark Antony} to the Senate house,
1044   And he shall say, you are not well to day:
1045   Let me vpon my knee, preuaile in this.
1046   <S {Caes}.> {Mark Antony} shall say I am not well,
1047   And for thy humor, I will stay at home.
1048   <D {Enter Decius}.>
1049   Heere's {Decius Brutus}, he shall tell them so.
1050   <S {Deci}.> {Caesar}, all haile: Good morrow worthy {Caesar},
1051   I come to fetch you to the Senate house.
1052   <S {Caes}.> And you are come in very happy time,
1053   To beare my greeting to the Senators,
1054   And tell them that I will not come to day:
1055   Cannot, is false: and that I dare not, falser:
1056   I will not come to day, tell them so {Decius}.
1057   <S {Calp}.> Say he is sicke.
1058   <S {Caes}.> Shall {Caesar} send a Lye?
1059   Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre,
1060   To be afear'd to tell Gray- beards the truth:
1061   {#Decius}, go tell them, {Caesar} will not come.
1062   <S {Deci}.> Most mighty {Caesar}, let me know some cause,
1063   Lest I be laught at when I tell them so.
1064   <S {Caes}.> The cause is in my #Will, I will not come,
1065   That is enough to satisfie the Senate.
1066   But for your priuate satisfaction,
1067   Because I loue you, I will let you know.
1068   {Calphurnia} heere my wife, stayes me at home:
1069   She dreampt to night, she saw my Statue,
1070   Which like a Fountaine, with an hundred spouts
1071   Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
1072   Came smiling, & did bathe their hands in it:
1073   And these does she apply, for warnings and portents,
1074   And euils imminent; and on her knee
1075   Hath begg'd, that I will stay at home to day.
1076   <S {Deci}.> This Dreame is all amisse interpreted,
1077   It was a vision, faire and fortunate:
1078   Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes,
1079   In which so many smiling Romans bath'd,
1080   Signifies, that from you great Rome shall sucke
1081   Reuiuing blood, and that great men shall presse
1082   For Tinctures, Staines, Reliques, and Cognisance.
1083   This by {Calphurnia's} Dreame is signified.
1084   <S {Caes}.> And this way haue you well expounded it.
1085   <S {Deci}.> I haue, when you haue heard what I can say:
1086   And know it now, the Senate haue concluded
1087   To giue this day, a Crowne to mighty {Caesar}.
1088   If you shall send them word you will not come,
1089   Their mindes may change. Besides, it were a mocke
1090   Apt to be render'd, for some one to say,
1091   Breake vp the Senate, till another time:
1092   When {Caesars} wife shall meete with better Dreames.
1093   If {Caesar} hide himselfe, shall they not whisper
1094   Loe {Caesar} is affraid?
1095   Pardon me {Caesar}, for my deere deere loue
1096   To your proceeding, bids me tell you this:
1097   And reason to my loue is liable.
1098  *<S {Caes}.> How foolish do your fears seeme now {Calphurnia}?
1099   I am ashamed I did yeeld to them.
1100   Giue me my Robe, for I will go.
1101   <D {Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Caska, Trebo-nius},
1102   {Cynna, and Publius}.>
1103   And looke where {Publius} is come to fetch me.
1104   <S {Pub}.> Good morrow {Caesar}.
1105   <S {Caes}.> Welcome {Publius}.
1106   What {Brutus}, are you stirr'd so earely too?
1107   Good morrow {Caska}: {Caius Ligarius},
1108   {#Caesar} was ne're so much your enemy,
1109   As that same Ague which hath made you leane.
1110   What is't #a Clocke?
1111   <S {Bru}.> {Caesar}, 'tis strucken eight.
1112   <S {Caes}.> I thanke you for your paines and curtesie.
1113   <D {Enter Antony}.>
1114   See, {Antony} that Reuels long a- nights
1115   Is notwithstanding vp. Good morrow {Antony}.
1116   <S {Ant}.> So to most Noble {Caesar}.
1117   <S {Caes}.> Bid them prepare within:
1118   I am #too blame to be thus waited for.
1119   Now {Cynna}, now {Metellus}: what {Trebonius},
1120   I haue an houres talke in store for you:
1121   Remember that you call on me to day:
1122   Be neere me, that I may remember you.
1123   <S {Treb}.> {Caesar} I will: and so neere will I be,
1124   That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further.
1125  *<S {Caes}.> Good Friends go in, and taste some wine with me.
1126   And we (like Friends) will straight way go together.
1127   <S {Bru}.> That euery like is not the same, O {Caesar},
1128   The heart of {Brutus} earnes to thinke vpon.  <D {Exeunt}>
1129   <D {Enter Artemidorus}.>
1130  *{#Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heede of Cassius; come not}
      <P kk5v>
1131  *{neere Caska, haue an eye to Cynna, trust not Trebonius, marke}
1132  *{well Metellus Cymber, Decius Brutus loues thee not: Thou}
1133  *{hast wrong'd Caius Ligarius. There is but one minde in all}
1134  *{these men, and it is bent against Caesar: If thou beest not Im-mortall},
1135  *{looke about you: Security giues way to Conspiracie}.
1136   {The mighty Gods defend thee}.
1137   Thy Louer, {Artemidorus}.
1138   Heere will I stand, till {Caesar} passe along,
1139   And as a Sutor will I giue him this:
1140   My heart laments, that Vertue cannot liue
1141   Out of the teeth of Emulation.
1142   If thou reade this, O {Caesar}, thou mayest liue;
1143   If not, the Fates with Traitors do contriue.  <D {Exit}.>
1144   <D {Enter Portia and Lucius}.>
1145   <S {Por}.> I prythee Boy, run to the Senate- house,
1146   Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
1147   Why doest thou stay?
1148   <S {Luc}.> To know my errand Madam.
1149   <S {Por}.> I would haue had thee there and heere agen
1150   Ere I can tell thee what thou should'st do there:
1151   O Constancie, be strong vpon my side,
1152   Set a huge Mountaine 'tweene my Heart and Tongue:
1153   I haue a mans minde, but a womans #might:
1154   How hard it is for women to keepe counsell.
1155   Art thou heere yet?
1156   <S {Luc}.> Madam, what should I do?
1157   Run to the Capitoll, and nothing else?
1158   And so returne to you, and nothing else?
1159  *<S {Por}.> Yes, bring me word Boy, if thy Lord look well,
1160   For he went sickly forth: and take good note
1161   What {Caesar} doth, what Sutors presse to him.
1162   Hearke Boy, what noyse is that?
1163   <S {Luc}.> I heare none Madam.
1164   <S {Por}.> Prythee listen well:
1165   I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray,
1166   And the winde brings it from the Capitoll.
1167   <S {Luc}.> Sooth Madam, I heare nothing.
1168   <D {Enter the Soothsayer}.>
1169   <S {Por}.> Come hither Fellow, which way hast thou bin?
1170   <S {Sooth}.> At mine owne house, good Lady.
1171   <S {Por}.> What is't #a clocke?
1172   <S {Sooth}.> About the ninth houre Lady.
1173   <S {Por}.> Is {Caesar} yet gone to the Capitoll?
1174   <S {Sooth}.> Madam not yet, I go to take my stand,
1175   To see him passe on to the Capitoll.
1176   <S {Por}.> Thou hast some suite to {Caesar}, hast thou not?
1177   <S {Sooth}.> That I haue Lady, if it will please {Caesar}
1178   To be so good to {Caesar}, as to heare me:
1179   I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe.
1180   <S {Por}.> Why know'st thou any harme's intended to-wards
1181   him?
1182   <S {Sooth}.> None that I know will be,
1183   Much that I feare may chance:
1184   Good morrow to you: heere the street is narrow:
1185   The throng that followes {Caesar} at the heeles,
1186   Of Senators, of Praetors, common Sutors,
1187   Will crowd a feeble man (almost) to death:
1188   Ile get me to a place more voyd, and there
1189   Speake to great {Caesar} as he comes along.  <D {Exit}>
1190   <S {Por}.> I must go in:
1191   Aye me! How weake a thing
1192   The heart of woman is? O {Brutus},
1193   The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize.
1194   Sure the Boy heard me: {Brutus} hath a suite
1195   That {Caesar} will not grant. O, I grow faint:
1196   Run {Lucius}, and commend me to my Lord,
1197   Say I am merry; Come to me againe,
1198   And bring me word what he doth say to thee.  <D {Exeunt}>
1199   <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
1200   <D {Flourish}>.
1201  *<D {Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Metellus, Tre-bonius},
1202   {Cynna, Antony, Lepidus, Artimedorus,  Pub-lius},
1203   {and the Soothsayer}.>
1204   <S {Caes}.> The Ides of March are come.
1205   <S {Sooth}.> #I {Caesar}, but not gone.
1206   <S {Art}.> Haile {Caesar}: Read this Scedule.
1207   <S {Deci}.> {Trebonius} doth desire you to ore- read
1208   (At your best leysure) this his humble suite.
1209   <S {Art}.> O {Caesar}, reade mine first: for mine's a suite
1210   That touches {Caesar} neerer. Read it great {Caesar}.
1211   <S {Caes}.> What touches vs our selfe, shall be last seru'd.
1212   <S {Art}.> Delay not {Caesar}, read it instantly.
1213   <S {Caes}.> What, is the fellow mad?
1214   <S {Pub}.> Sirra, giue place.
1215   <S {Cassi}.> What, vrge you your Petitions in the street?
1216   Come to the Capitoll.
1217   <S {Popil}.> I wish your enterprize to day may thriue.
1218   <S {Cassi}.> What enterprize {Popillius}?
1219   <S {Popil}.> Fare you well.
1220   <S {Bru}.> What said {Popillius Lena}?
1221   <S {Cassi}.> He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue:
1222   I feare our purpose is discouered.
1223   <S {Bru}.> Looke how he makes to {Caesar}: marke him.
1224   <S {Cassi}.> {Caska} be sodaine, for we feare preuention.
1225   {#Brutus} what shall be done? If this be knowne,
1226   {#Cassius} or {Caesar} neuer shall turne backe,
1227   For I will slay my selfe.
1228   <S {Bru}.> {Cassius} be constant:
1229   {Popillius Lena} speakes not of our purposes,
1230   For looke he smiles, and {Caesar} doth not change.
1231  *<S {Cassi}.> {Trebonius} knowes his time: for look you {Brutus}
1232   He drawes {Mark Antony} out of the way.
1233   <S {Deci}.> Where is {Metellus Cimber}, let him go,
1234   And presently preferre his suite to {Caesar}.
1235   <S {Bru}.> He is addrest: presse neere, and second him.
1236   <S {Cin}.> {Caska}, you are the first that reares your hand.
1237   <S {Caes}.> Are we all ready? What is now amisse,
1238   That {Caesar} and his Senate must redresse?
1239  *<S {Metel}.> Most high, most mighty, and most puisant {Caesar}
1240   {Metellus Cymber} throwes before thy Seate
1241   An humble heart.
1242   <S {Caes}.> I must preuent thee {Cymber}:
1243   These couchings, and these lowly courtesies
1244   Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
1245   And turne pre- Ordinance, and first Decree
1246   Into the lane of Children. Be not fond,
1247   To thinke that {Caesar} beares such Rebell blood
1248   That will be thaw'd from the true quality
1249  *With that which melteth Fooles, I meane sweet words,
1250   Low- crooked- curtsies, and base Spaniell fawning:
1251   Thy Brother by decree is banished:
1252   If thou doest bend, and pray, and fawne for him,
1253   I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way:
1254   Know, {Caesar} doth not wrong, nor without cause
1255   Will he be satisfied.
1256  *<S {Metel}.> Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne,
      <P kk6>
1257   To sound more sweetly in great {Caesars} eare,
1258   For the repealing of my banish'd Brother?
1259   <S {Bru}.> I kisse thy hand, but not in flattery  {Caesar}:
1260   Desiring thee, that {Publius Cymber} may
1261   Haue an immediate freedome of repeale.
1262   <S {Caes}.> What {Brutus}?
1263   <S {Cassi}.> Pardon {Caesar}: {Caesar} pardon:
1264   As lowe as to thy foote doth {Cassius} fall,
1265   To begge infranchisement for {Publius Cymber}.
1266   <S {Caes}.> I could be well mou'd, if I were as you,
1267   If I could pray to mooue, Prayers would mooue me:
1268   But I am constant as the Northerne Starre,
1269   Of whose true fixt, and resting quality,
1270   There is no fellow in the Firmament.
1271   The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes,
1272   They are all Fire, and euery one doth shine:
1273   But, there's but one in all doth hold his place.
1274   So, in the World; 'Tis furnish'd well with Men,
1275   And Men are Flesh and Blood, and apprehensiue;
1276   Yet in the number, I do know but One
1277   That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke,
1278   Vnshak'd of Motion: and that I am he,
1279   Let me a little shew it, euen in this:
1280   That I was constant {Cymber} should be banish'd,
1281   And constant do remaine to keepe him so.
1282   <S {Cinna}.> O {Caesar}.
1283   <S {Caes}.> Hence: Wilt thou lift vp Olympus?
1284   <S {Decius}.> Great {Caesar}.
1285   <S {Caes}.> Doth not {Brutus} bootlesse kneele?
1286   <S {Cask}.> Speake hands for me.
1287   <D {They stab Caesar}.>
1288   <S {Caes}.> {Et Tu Brute}? === Then fall {Caesar}.  <D {Dyes}>
1289   <S {Cin}.> Liberty, Freedome; Tyranny is dead,
1290   Run hence, proclaime, cry it about the Streets.
1291   <S {Cassi}.> Some to the common Pulpits, and cry out
1292   Liberty, Freedome, and Enfranchisement.
1293   <S {Bru}.> People and Senators, be not affrighted:
1294   Fly not, stand still: Ambitions debt is paid.
1295   <S {Cask}.> Go to the Pulpit {Brutus}.
1296   <S {Dec}.> And {Cassius} too.
1297   <S {Bru}.> Where's {Publius}?
1298   <S {Cin}.> Heere, quite confounded with this mutiny.
1299  *<S {Met}.> Stand fast together, least some Friend of {Caesars}
1300   Should chance===
1301   <S {Bru}.> Talke not of standing. {Publius} good cheere,
1302   There is no harme intended to your person,
1303   Nor to no Roman else: so tell them {Publius}.
1304   <S {Cassi}.> And  leaue vs {Publius}, least that the people
1305   Rushing on vs, should do your Age some mischiefe.
1306   <S {Bru}.> Do so, and let no man abide this deede,
1307   But we the Doers.
1308   <D {Enter Trebonius}.>
1309   <S {Cassi}.> Where is {Antony}?
1310   <S {Treb}.> Fled to his House amaz'd:
1311   Men, Wiues, and Children, stare, cry out, and run,
1312   As it were Doomesday.
1313   <S {Bru}.> Fates, we will know your pleasures:
1314   That we shall dye we know, 'tis but the time
1315   And drawing dayes out, that men stand vpon.
1316   <S {Cask}.> Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life,
1317   Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death.
1318   <S {Bru}.> Grant that, and then is Death a Benefit:
1319   So are we {Caesars} Friends, that haue abridg'd
1320   His time of fearing death. Stoope Romans, stoope,
1321   And let vs bathe our hands in {Caesars} blood
1322   Vp to the Elbowes, and besmeare our Swords:
1323   Then walke we forth, euen to the Market place,
1324   And wauing our red Weapons o're our heads,
1325   Let's all cry Peace, Freedome, and Liberty.
1326  *<S {Cassi}.> Stoop then, and wash. How many Ages hence
1327   Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer,
1328   In State vnborne, and Accents yet vnknowne?
1329   <S {Bru}.> How many times shall {Caesar} bleed in sport,
1330   That now on {Pompeyes} Basis lye along,
1331   No worthier then the dust?
1332   <S {Cassi}.> So oft as that shall be,
1333   So often shall the knot of vs be call'd,
1334   The Men that gaue their Country liberty.
1335   <S {Dec}.> What, shall we forth?
1336   <S {Cassi}.> #I, euery man away.
1337   {#Brutus} shall leade, and we will grace his heeles
1338   With the most boldest, and best hearts of Rome.
1339   <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
1340   <S {Bru}.> Soft, who comes heere? A friend of {Antonies}.
1341   <S {Ser}.> Thus {Brutus} did my Master bid me kneele;
1342   Thus did {Mark Antony} bid me fall downe,
1343   And being prostrate, thus he bad me say:
1344   {#Brutus} is Noble, Wise, Valiant, and Honest;
1345   {#Caesar} was Mighty, Bold, Royall, and Louing:
1346   Say, I loue {Brutus}, and I honour him;
1347   Say, I fear'd {Caesar}, honour'd him, and lou'd him.
1348   If {Brutus} will vouchsafe, that {Antony}
1349   May safely come to him, and be resolu'd
1350   How {Caesar} hath deseru'd to lye in death,
1351   {Mark Antony}, shall not loue {Caesar} dead
1352   So well as {Brutus} liuing; but will follow
1353   The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble {Brutus},
1354   Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State,
1355   With all true Faith. So sayes my Master {Antony}.
1356   <S {Bru}.> Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane,
1357   I neuer thought him worse:
1358   Tell him, so please him come vnto this place
1359   He shall be satisfied: and by my Honor
1360   Depart vntouch'd.
1361   <S {Ser}.> Ile fetch him presently.  <D {Exit Seruant}.>
1362   <S {Bru}.> I know that we shall haue him well to Friend.
1363   <S {Cassi}.> I wish we may: But yet haue I a minde
1364   That feares him much: and my misgiuing still
1365   Falles shrewdly to the purpose.
1366   <D {Enter Antony}.>
1367   <S {Bru}.> But heere comes {Antony}:
1368   Welcome {Mark Antony}.
1369   <S {Ant}.> O mighty {Caesar}! Dost thou lye so lowe?
1370   Are all thy Conquests, Glories, Triumphes, Spoiles,
1371   Shrunke to this little Measure? Fare thee well.
1372   I know not Gentlemen what you intend,
1373   Who else must be let blood, who else is ranke:
1374   If I my selfe, there is no houre so fit
1375   As {Caesars} deaths houre; nor no Instrument
1376   Of halfe that worth, as those your Swords; made rich
1377   With the most Noble blood of all this World.
1378   I do beseech yee, if you beare me hard,
1379   Now, whil'st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake,
1380   Fulfill your pleasure. Liue a thousand yeeres,
1381   I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye.
1382   No place will please me so, no meane of death,
1383   As heere by {Caesar}, and by you cut off,
1384   The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age.
1385   <S {Bru}.> O {Antony}! Begge not your death of vs:
1386   Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell,
1387   As by our hands, and this our present Acte
1388   You see we do: Yet see you but our hands,
      <P kk6v>
1389   And this, the bleeding businesse they haue done:
1390   Our hearts you see not, they are pittifull:
1391   And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome,
1392   As fire driues out fire, so pitty, pitty
1393   Hath done this deed on {Caesar}. For your part,
1394   To you, our Swords haue leaden points {Marke Antony}:
1395   Our Armes in strength of malice, and our Hearts
1396   Of Brothers temper, do receiue you in,
1397   With all kinde loue, good thoughts, and reuerence.
1398   <S {Cassi}.> Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans,
1399   In the disposing of new Dignities.
1400   <S {Bru}.> Onely be patient, till we haue appeas'd
1401   The Multitude, beside themselues with feare,
1402   And then, we will deliuer you the cause,
1403   Why I, that did loue {Caesar} when I strooke him,
1404   Haue thus proceeded.
1405   <S {Ant}.> I doubt not of your Wisedome:
1406   Let each man render me his bloody hand.
1407   First {Marcus Brutus} will I shake with you;
1408   Next {Caius Cassius} do I take your hand;
1409   Now {Decius Brutus} yours; now yours {Metellus};
1410   Yours {Cinna}; and my valiant {Caska}, yours;
1411   Though last, not least in loue, yours good {Trebonius}.
1412   Gentlemen all: Alas, what shall I say,
1413   My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
1414   That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me,
1415   Either a Coward, or a Flatterer.
1416   That I did loue thee {Caesar}, O 'tis true:
1417   If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now,
1418   Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death,
1419   To see thy {Antony} making his peace,
1420   Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes?
1421   Most Noble, in the presence of thy Coarse,
1422   Had I as many eyes, as thou hast wounds,
1423   Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood,
1424   It would become me better, then to close
1425   In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies.
1426   Pardon me {Iulius}, heere was't thou bay'd braue Hart,
1427   Heere did'st thou fall, and heere thy Hunters stand
1428   Sign'd in thy Spoyle, and Crimson'd in thy Lethee.
1429   O World! thou wast the Forrest to this Hart,
1430   And this indeed, O World, the Hart of thee.
1431   How like a Deere, stroken by many Princes,
1432   Dost thou heere lye?
1433   <S {Cassi}.> {Mark Antony}.
1434   <S {Ant}.> Pardon me {Caius Cassius}:
1435   The Enemies of {Caesar}, shall say this:
1436   Then, in a Friend, it is cold Modestie.
1437   <S {Cassi}.> I blame you not for praising {Caesar} so.
1438   But what compact meane you to haue with vs?
1439   Will you be prick'd in number of our Friends,
1440   Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
1441   <S {Ant}.> Therefore I tooke your hands, but was indeed
1442   Sway'd from the point, by looking downe on {Caesar}.
1443   Friends am I with you all, and loue you all,
1444   Vpon this hope, that you shall giue me Reasons,
1445   Why, and wherein, {Caesar} was dangerous.
1446   <S {Bru}.> Or else were this a sauage Spectacle:
1447   Our Reasons are so full of good regard,
1448   That were you {Antony}, the Sonne of {Caesar},
1449   You should be satisfied.
1450   <S {Ant}.> That's all I seeke,
1451   And am moreouer sutor, that I may
1452   Produce his body to the Market- place,
1453   And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend,
1454   Speake in the Order of his Funerall.
1455   <S {Bru}.> You shall {Marke Antony}.
1456   <S {Cassi}.> {Brutus}, a word with you:
1457   You know not what you do; Do not consent
1458   That {Antony} speake in his Funerall:
1459   Know you how much the people may be mou'd
1460   By that which he will vtter.
1461   <S {Bru}.> By your pardon:
1462   I will my selfe into the Pulpit first,
1463   And shew the reason of our {Caesars} death.
1464   What {Antony} shall speake, I will protest
1465   He speakes by leaue, and by permission:
1466   And that we are contented {Caesar} shall
1467   Haue all true Rites, and lawfull Ceremonies,
1468   It shall aduantage more, then do vs wrong.
1469   <S {Cassi}.> I know not what may fall, I like it not.
1470   <S {Bru}.> {Mark Antony}, heere take you {Caesars} body:
1471   You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs,
1472   But speake all good you can deuise of {Caesar},
1473   And say you doo't by our permission:
1474   Else shall you not haue any hand at all
1475   About his Funerall. And you shall speake
1476   In the same Pulpit whereto I am going,
1477   After my speech is ended.
1478   <S {Ant}.> Be it so:
1479   I do desire no more.
1480   <S {Bru}.> Prepare the body then, and follow vs.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1481   <D {Manet Antony}.>
1482   O pardon me, thou bleeding peece of Earth:
1483   That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers.
1484   Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man
1485   That euer liued in the Tide of Times.
1486   Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood.
1487   Ouer thy wounds, now do I Prophesie,
1488   (Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips,
1489   To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue)
1490   A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men;
1491   Domesticke Fury, and fierce Ciuill strife,
1492   Shall cumber all the parts of Italy:
1493   Blood and destruction shall be so in vse,
1494   And dreadfull Obiects so familiar,
1495   That Mothers shall but smile, when they behold
1496   Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre:
1497   All pitty choak'd with custome of fell deeds,
1498   And {Caesars} Spirit ranging for Reuenge,
1499   With {Ate} by his side, come hot from #Hell,
1500   Shall in these Confines, with a Monarkes voyce,
1501   Cry hauocke, and let slip the Dogges of Warre,
1502   That this foule deede, shall smell aboue the earth
1503   With Carrion men, groaning for Buriall.
1504   <D {Enter Octauio's Seruant}.>
1505   You serue {Octauius Caesar}, do you not?
1506   <S {Ser}.> I do {Marke Antony}.
1507   <S {Ant}.> {Caesar} did write for him to come to Rome.
1508   <S {Ser}.> He did receiue his Letters, and is comming,
1509   And bid me say to you by word of mouth===
1510   O {Caesar}!
1511  *<S {Ant}.> Thy heart is bigge: get thee a- part and weepe:
1512   Passion I see is catching from mine eyes,
1513   Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine,
1514   Began to water. Is thy Master comming?
1515  *<S {Ser}.> He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome.
1516   <S {Ant}.> Post backe with speede,
1517   And tell him what hath chanc'd:
1518   Heere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
1519   No Rome of safety for {Octauius} yet,
1520   Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay a- while,
      <P ll1>
1521   Thou shalt not backe, till I haue borne this course
1522   Into the Market place: There shall I try
1523   In my Oration, how the People take
1524   The cruell issue of these bloody men,
1525   According to the which, thou shalt discourse
1526   To yong {Octauius}, of the state of things.
1527   Lend me your hand.  <D {Exeunt}>
1528   <D {Enter Brutus and goes into the Pulpit, and Cassi-us},
1529   {with the Plebeians}.>
1530   <S {Ple}.> We will be satisfied: let vs be satisfied.
1531  *<S {Bru}.> Then follow me, and giue me Audience friends.
1532   {#Cassius} go you into the other streete,
1533   And part the Numbers:
1534   Those that will heare me speake, let 'em stay heere;
1535   Those that will follow {Cassius}, go with him,
1536   And publike Reasons shall be rendred
1537   Of {Caesars} death.
1538   <S 1.{Ple}.> I will heare {Brutus} speake.
1539   <S 2.> I will heare {Cassius}, and compare their Reasons,
1540   When seuerally we heare them rendred.
1541   <S 3.> The Noble {Brutus} is ascended: Silence.
1542   <S {Bru}.> Be patient till the last.
1543  *Romans, Countrey- men, and Louers, heare mee for my
1544  *cause, and be silent, that you may heare. Beleeue me for
1545  *mine Honor, and haue respect to mine Honor, that you
1546  *may beleeue. Censure me in your Wisedom, and awake
1547  *your Senses, that you may the better Iudge. If there bee
1548  *any in this Assembly, any deere Friend of {Caesars}, to him
1549  *I say, that {Brutus} loue to {Caesar}, was no lesse then his. If
1550  *then, that Friend demand, why {Brutus} rose against {Cae-sar},
1551  *this is my answer: Not that I lou'd {Caesar} lesse, but
1552  *that I lou'd Rome more. Had you rather {Caesar} were li-uing,
1553  *and dye all Slaues; then that {Caesar} were dead, to
1554  *liue all Free- men? As {Caesar} lou'd mee, I weepe for him;
1555  *as he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I
1556  *honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There
1557  *is Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for
1558  *his Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere
1559  *so base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him
1560  *haue I offended. Who is heere so rude, that would not
1561  *be a Roman? If any, speak, for him haue I offended. Who
1562  *is heere so vile, that will not loue his Countrey? If any,
1563   speake, for him haue I offended. I pause for a Reply.
1564   <S {All}.> None {Brutus}, none.
1565  *<S {Brutus}.> Then none haue I offended. I haue done no
1566  *more to {Caesar}, then you shall do to {Brutus}. The Questi-on
1567  *of his death, is inroll'd in the Capitoll: his Glory not
1568  *extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences  en-forc'd,
1569   for which he suffered death.
1570   <D {Enter Mark Antony, with Caesars body}.>
1571  *Heere comes his Body, mourn'd by {Marke Antony}, who
1572  *though he had no hand in his death, shall receiue the be-nefit
1573  *of his dying, a place in the Co[m]monwealth, as which
1574  *of you shall not. With this I depart, that as I slewe my
1575  *best Louer for the good of Rome, I haue the same Dag-ger
1576  *for my selfe, when it shall please my Country to need
1577   my death.
1578   <S {All}.> Liue {Brutus}, liue, liue.
1579   <S 1.> Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house.
1580   <S 2.> Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors.
1581   <S 3.> Let him be {Caesar}.
1582   <S 4.> {Caesars} better parts,
1583   Shall be Crown'd in {Brutus}.
1584   <S 1.> Wee'l bring him to his House,
1585   With Showts and Clamors.
1586   <S {Bru}.> My Country- men.
1587   <S 2.> Peace, silence, {Brutus} speakes.
1588   <S 1.> Peace ho.
1589   <S {Bru}.> Good Countrymen, let me depart alone,
1590   And (for my sake) stay heere with {Antony}:
1591   Do grace to {Caesars} Corpes, and grace his Speech
1592   Tending to {Caesars} Glories, which {Marke Antony}
1593   (By our permission) is allow'd to make.
1594   I do intreat you, not a man depart,
1595   Saue I alone, till {Antony} haue spoke.  <D {Exit}>
1596   <S 1> Stay ho, and let vs heare {Mark Antony}.
1597   <S 3> Let him go vp into the publike Chaire,
1598   Wee'l heare him: Noble {Antony} go vp.
1599   <S {Ant}.> For {Brutus} sake, I am beholding to you.
1600   <S 4> What does he say of {Brutus}?
1601   <S 3> He sayes, for {Brutus} sake
1602   He findes himselfe beholding to vs all.
1603   <S 4> 'Twere best he speake no harme of {Brutus} heere?
1604   <S 1> This {Caesar} was a Tyrant.
1605   <S 3> Nay that's certaine:
1606   We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
1607   <S 2> Peace, let vs heare what {Antony} can say.
1608   <S {Ant}.> You gentle Romans.
1609   <S {All}.> Peace hoe, let vs heare him.
1610  *<S {An}.> Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears:
1611   I come to bury {Caesar}, not to praise him:
1612   The euill that men do, liues after them,
1613   The good is oft enterred with their bones,
1614   So let it be with {Caesar}. The Noble {Brutus},
1615   Hath told you {Caesar} was Ambitious:
1616   If it were so, it was a greeuous Fault,
1617   And greeuously hath {Caesar} answer'd it.
1618   Heere, vnder leaue of {Brutus}, and the rest
1619   (For {Brutus} is an Honourable man,
1620   So are they all; all Honourable men)
1621   Come I to speake in {Caesars} Funerall.
1622   He was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me;
1623   But {Brutus} sayes, he was Ambitious,
1624   And {Brutus} is an Honourable man.
1625   He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome,
1626   Whose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill:
1627   Did this in {Caesar} seeme Ambitious?
1628   When that the poore haue cry'de, {Caesar} hath wept:
1629   Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe,
1630   Yet {Brutus} sayes, he was Ambitious:
1631   And {Brutus} is an Honourable man.
1632   You all did see, that on the {Lupercall},
1633   I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne,
1634   Which he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition?
1635   Yet {Brutus} sayes, he was Ambitious:
1636   And sure he is an Honourable man.
1637   I speake not to disprooue what {Brutus} spoke,
1638   But heere I am, to speake what I do know;
1639   You all did loue him once, not without cause,
1640   What cause with- holds you then, to mourne for him?
1641   O Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts,
1642   And Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me,
1643   My heart is in the Coffin there with {Caesar},
1644   And I must pawse, till it come backe to me.
1645   <S 1> Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings.
1646   <S 2> If thou consider rightly of the matter,
1647   {#Caesar} ha's had great wrong.
1648  *<S 3> Ha's hee Masters? I feare there will a worse come in |(his place.
      <P ll1v>
1649  *<S 4.> Mark'd ye his words? he would not take y Crown,
1650   Therefore 'tis certaine, he was not Ambitious.
1651   <S 1.> If it be found so, some will deere abide it.
1652  *<S 2.> Poore soule, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
1653   <S 3.> There's not a Nobler man in Rome then {Antony}.
1654   <S 4.> Now marke him, he begins againe to speake.
1655   <S {Ant}.> But yesterday, the word of {Caesar} might
1656   Haue stood against the World: Now lies he there,
1657   And none so poore to do him reuerence.
1658   O Maisters! If I were dispos'd to stirre
1659   Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage,
1660   I should do {Brutus} wrong, and {Cassius} wrong:
1661   Who (you all know) are Honourable men.
1662   I will not do them wrong: I rather choose
1663   To wrong the dead, to wrong my selfe and you,
1664   Then I will wrong such Honourable men.
1665   But heere's a Parchment, with the Seale of {Caesar},
1666   I found it in his Closset, 'tis his #Will:
1667   Let but the Commons heare this Testament:
1668   (Which pardon me) I do not meane to reade,
1669   And they would go and kisse dead {Caesars} wounds,
1670   And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood;
1671   Yea, begge a haire of him for Memory,
1672   And dying, mention it within their Willes,
1673   Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie
1674   Vnto their issue.
1675   <S 4> Wee'l heare the #Will, reade it {Marke Antony}.
1676   <S {All}.> The #Will, the #Will; we will heare {Caesars} #Will.
1677  *<S {Ant}.> Haue patience gentle Friends, I must not read it.
1678   It is not meete you know how {Caesar} lou'd you:
1679   You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but men:
1680   And being men, hearing the #Will of {Caesar},
1681   It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
1682   'Tis good you know not that you are his Heires,
1683   For if you should, O what would come of it?
1684   <S 4> Read the #Will, wee'l heare it {Antony}:
1685   You shall reade vs the #Will, {Caesars} #Will.
1686   <S {Ant}.> Will you be Patient? Will you stay a- while?
1687   I haue o're- shot my selfe to tell you of it,
1688   I feare I wrong the Honourable men,
1689   Whose Daggers haue stabb'd {Caesar}: I do feare it.
1690   <S 4> They were Traitors: Honourable men?
1691   <S {All}.> The #Will, the Testament.
1692  *<S 2> They were Villaines, Murderers: the #Will, read the
1693   #Will.
1694   <S {Ant}.> You will compell me then to read the #Will:
1695   Then make a Ring about the Corpes of {Caesar},
1696   And let me shew you him that made the #Will:
1697   Shall I descend? And will you giue me leaue?
1698   <S {All}.> Come downe.
1699   <S 2> Descend.
1700   <S 3> You shall haue leaue.
1701   <S 4> A Ring, stand round.
1702   <S 1> Stand from the Hearse, stand from the Body.
1703   <S 2> Roome for {Antony}, most Noble {Antony}.
1704   <S {Ant}.> Nay presse not so vpon me, stand farre off.
1705   <S {All}.> Stand backe: roome, beare backe.
1706   <S {Ant}.> If you haue teares, prepare to shed them now.
1707   You all do know this Mantle, I remember
1708   The first time euer {Caesar} put it on,
1709   'Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent,
1710   That day he ouercame the {Neruij}.
1711   Looke, in this place ran {Cassius} Dagger through:
1712   See what a rent the enuious {Caska} made:
1713   Through this, the wel- beloued {Brutus} stabb'd,
1714   And as he pluck'd his cursed Steele away:
1715   Marke how the blood of {Caesar} followed it,
1716   As rushing out of doores, to be resolu'd
1717   If {Brutus} so vnkindely knock'd, or no:
1718   For {Brutus}, as you know, was {Caesars} Angel.
1719   Iudge, O you Gods, how deerely {Caesar} lou'd him:
1720   This was the most vnkindest cut of all.
1721   For when the Noble {Caesar} saw him stab,
1722   Ingratitude, more strong then Traitors armes,
1723   Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart,
1724   And in his Mantle, muffling vp his face,
1725   Euen at the Base of {Pompeyes} Statue
1726   (Which all the while ran blood) great {Caesar} fell.
1727   O what a fall was there, my Countrymen?
1728   Then I, and you, and all of vs fell downe,
1729   Whil'st bloody Treason flourish'd ouer vs.
1730   O now you weepe, and I perceiue you feele
1731   The dint of pitty: These are gracious droppes.
1732   Kinde Soules, what weepe you, when you but behold
1733   Our {Caesars} Vesture wounded? Looke you heere,
1734   Heere is Himselfe, marr'd as you see with Traitors.
1735   <S 1.> O pitteous spectacle!
1736   <S 2.> O Noble {Caesar}!
1737   <S 3.> O wofull day!
1738   <S 4.> O Traitors, Villaines!
1739   <S 1.> O most bloody sight!
1740   <S 2.> We will be reueng'd: Reuenge
1741   About, seeke, burne, fire, kill, slay,
1742   Let not a Traitor liue.
1743   <S {Ant}.> Stay Country- men.
1744   <S 1.> Peace there, heare the Noble {Antony}.
1745  *<S 2.> Wee'l heare him, wee'l follow him, wee'l dy with
1746   him.
1747   <S {Ant}.> Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stirre |(you vp
1748   To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny:
1749   They that haue done this Deede, are honourable.
1750   What priuate greefes they haue, alas I know not,
1751  *That made them do it: They are Wise, and Honourable,
1752   And will no doubt with Reasons answer you.
1753   I come not (Friends) to steale away your hearts,
1754   I am no Orator, as {Brutus} is:
1755   But (as you know me all) a plaine blunt man
1756   That loue my Friend, and that they know full well,
1757   That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him:
1758   For I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth,
1759   Action, nor Vtterance, nor the power of Speech,
1760   To stirre mens Blood. I onely speake right on:
1761   I tell you that, which you your selues do know,
1762  *Shew you sweet {Caesars} wounds, poor poor dum mouths
1763   And bid them speake for me: But were I {Brutus},
1764   And {Brutus Antony}, there were an {Antony}
1765   Would ruffle vp your Spirits, and put a Tongue
1766   In euery Wound of {Caesar}, that should moue
1767   The stones of Rome, to rise and Mutiny.
1768   <S {All}.> Wee'l Mutiny.
1769   <S 1> Wee'l burne the house of {Brutus}.
1770   <S 3> Away then, come, seeke the Conspirators.
1771  *<S {Ant}.> Yet heare me Countrymen, yet heare me speake
1772   <S {All}.> Peace hoe, heare {Antony}, most Noble {Antony}.
1773  *<S {Ant}.> Why Friends, you go to do you know not what:
1774   Wherein hath {Caesar} thus deseru'd your loues?
1775   Alas you know not, I must tell you then:
1776   You haue forgot the #Will I told you of.
1777  *<S {All}.> Most true, the #Will, let's stay and heare the #Wil.
1778   <S {Ant}.> Heere is the #Will, and vnder {Caesars} Seale:
1779   To euery Roman Citizen he giues,
1780   To euery seuerall man, seuenty fiue Drachmaes.
      <P ll2>
1781   <S 2 {Ple}.> Most Noble {Caesar}, wee'l reuenge his death.
1782   <S 3 {Ple}.> O Royall {Caesar}.
1783   <S {Ant}.> Heare me with patience.
1784   <S {All}.> Peace hoe
1785   <S {Ant}.> Moreouer, he hath left you all his Walkes,
1786   His priuate Arbors, and new- planted Orchards,
1787   On this side Tyber, he hath left them you,
1788   And to your heyres for euer: common pleasures
1789   To walke abroad, and recreate your selues.
1790   Heere was a {Caesar}: when comes such another?
1791   <S 1.{Ple}.> Neuer, neuer: come, away, away:
1792   Wee'l burne his body in the holy place,
1793   And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses.
1794   Take vp the body.
1795   <S 2.{Ple}.> Go fetch fire.
1796   <S 3.{Ple}.> Plucke downe Benches.
1797  *<S 4.{Ple}.> Plucke downe Formes, Windowes, any thing.
1798   <D {Exit Plebeians}.>
1799   <S {Ant}.> Now let it worke: Mischeefe thou art a- foot,
1800   Take thou what course thou wilt.
1801  *How now Fellow?
1802   <D {Enter Seruant}.>
1803   <S {Ser}.> Sir, {Octauius} is already come to Rome.
1804   <S {Ant}.> Where is hee?
1805   <S {Ser}.> He and {Lepidus} are at {Caesars} house.
1806   <S {Ant}.> And thither will I straight, to visit him:
1807   He comes vpon a wish. Fortune is merry,
1808   And in this mood will giue vs any thing.
1809   <S {Ser}.> I heard him say, {Brutus} and {Cassius}
1810   Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome.
1811   <S {Ant}.> Belike they had some notice of the people
1812  *How I had moued them. Bring me to {Octauius}. <D {Exeunt}>
1813   <D {Enter Cinna the Poet, and after him the Plebeians}.>
1814  *<S {Cinna}.> I dreamt to night, that I did feast with {Caesar},
1815   And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie:
1816   I haue no #will to wander foorth of doores,
1817   Yet something leads me foorth.
1818   <S 1.> What is your name?
1819   <S 2.> Whether are you going?
1820   <S 3.> Where do you dwell?
1821   <S 4.> Are you a married man, or a Batchellor?
1822   <S 2.> Answer euery man directly.
1823   <S 1.> #I, and breefely.
1824   <S 4.> #I, and wisely.
1825   <S 3.> #I, and truly, you were best.
1826  *<S {Cin}.> What is my name? Whether am I going? Where
1827  *do I dwell? Am I a married man, or a Batchellour? Then
1828  *to answer euery man, directly and breefely, wisely and
1829   truly: wisely I say, I am a Batchellor.
1830  *<S 2> That's as much as to say, they are fooles that mar-rie:
1831  *you'l beare me a bang for that I feare: proceede di-rectly.
1832  _
1833   <S {Cinna}.> Directly I am going to {Caesars} Funerall.
1834   <S 1.> As a Friend, or an Enemy?
1835   <S {Cinna}.> As a friend.
1836   <S 2.> That matter is answered directly.
1837   <S 4.> For your dwelling: breefely.
1838   <S {Cinna}.> Breefely, I dwell by the Capitoll.
1839   <S 3.> Your name sir, truly.
1840   <S {Cinna}.> Truly, my name is {Cinna}.
1841   <S 1.> Teare him to peeces, hee's a Conspirator.
1842   <S {Cinna}.> I am {Cinna} the Poet, I am {Cinna} the Poet.
1843  *<S 4.> Teare him for his bad verses, teare him for his bad
1844   Verses.
1845   <S {Cin}.> I am not {Cinna} the Conspirator.
1846   <S 4.> It is no matter, his name's {Cinna}, plucke but his
1847   name out of his heart, and turne him going.
1848  *<S 3.> Teare him, tear him; Come Brands hoe, Firebrands:
1849  *to {Brutus}, to {Cassius}, burne all. Some to {Decius} House,
1850   and some to {Caska's}; some to {Ligarius}: Away, go.
1851   <D {Exeunt all the Plebeians}.>
1852   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1853   <D {Enter Antony, Octauius, and Lepidus}.>
1854  *<S {Ant}.> These many then shall die, their names are prickt
1855  *<S {Octa}.> Your Brother too must dye: consent you {Lepidus}?
1856   <S {Lep}.> I do consent.
1857   <S {Octa}.> Pricke him downe {Antony}.
1858   <S {Lep}.> Vpon condition {Publius} shall not liue,
1859   Who is your Sisters sonne, {Marke Antony}.
1860  *<S {Ant}.> He shall not liue; looke, with a spot I dam him.
1861   But {Lepidus}, go you to {Caesars} house:
1862   Fetch the #Will hither, and we shall determine
1863   How to cut off some charge in Legacies.
1864   <S {Lep}.> What? shall I finde you heere?
1865   <S {Octa}.> Or heere, or at the Capitoll.  <D {Exit Lepidus}>
1866   <S {Ant}.> This is a slight vnmeritable man,
1867   Meet to be sent on Errands: is it fit
1868   The three- fold World diuided, he should stand
1869   One of the three to share it?
1870   <S {Octa}.> So you thought him,
1871   And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye
1872   In our blacke Sentence and Proscription.
1873   <S {Ant}.> {Octauius}, I haue seene more dayes then you,
1874   And though we lay these Honours on this man,
1875   To ease our selues of diuers sland'rous loads,
1876   He shall but beare them, as the Asse beares Gold,
1877   To groane and swet vnder the Businesse,
1878   Either led or driuen, as we point the way:
1879   And hauing brought our Treasure, where we will,
1880   Then take we downe his Load, and turne him off
1881   (Like to the empty Asse) to shake his eares,
1882   And graze in Commons.
1883   <S {Octa}.> You may do your #will:
1884   But hee's a tried, and valiant Souldier.
1885   <S {Ant}.> So is my Horse {Octauius}, and for that
1886   I do appoint him store of Prouender.
1887   It is a Creature that I teach to fight,
1888   To winde, to stop, to run directly on:
1889   His corporall Motion, gouern'd by my Spirit,
1890   And in some taste, is {Lepidus} but so:
1891   He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth:
1892   A barren spirited Fellow; one that feeds
1893   On Obiects, Arts, and Imitations.
1894   Which out of vse, and stal'de by other men
1895   Begin his fashion. Do not talke of him,
1896   But as a property: and now {Octauius},
1897   Listen great things. {Brutus} and {Cassius}
1898   Are leuying Powers; We must straight make head:
1899   Therefore let our Alliance be combin'd,
1900   Our best Friends made, our meanes stretcht,
1901   And let vs presently go sit in Councell,
1902   How couert matters may be best disclos'd,
1903   And open Perils surest answered.
1904   <S {Octa}.> Let vs do so: for we are at the stake,
      <P ll2v>
1905   And bayed about with many Enemies,
1906   And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare
1907   Millions of Mischeefes.  <D {Exeunt}>
1908  *<D {Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucillius, and the Army.  Titinius}
1909   {and Pindarus meete them}.>
1910   <S {Bru}.> Stand ho.
1911   <S {Lucil}.> Giue the word ho, and Stand.
1912   <S {Bru}.> What now {Lucillius}, is {Cassius} neere?
1913   <S {Lucil}.> He is at hand, and {Pindarus} is come
1914   To do you salutation from his Master.
1915   <S {Bru}.> He greets me well. Your Master {Pindarus}
1916   In his owne change, or by #ill Officers,
1917   Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish
1918   Things done, vndone: But if he be at hand
1919   I shall be satisfied.
1920   <S {Pin}.> I do not doubt
1921   But that my Noble Master will appeare
1922   Such as he is, full of regard, and Honour.
1923   <S {Bru}.> He is not doubted. A word {Lucillius}
1924   How he receiu'd you: let me be resolu'd.
1925   <S {Lucil}.> With courtesie, and with respect enough,
1926   But not with such familiar instances,
1927   Nor with such free and friendly Conference
1928   As he hath vs'd of old.
1929   <S {Bru}.> Thou hast describ'd
1930   A hot Friend, cooling: Euer note {Lucillius},
1931   When Loue begins to sicken and decay
1932   It vseth an enforced Ceremony.
1933   There are no trickes, in plaine and simple Faith:
1934   But hollow men, like Horses hot at hand,
1935   Make gallant shew, and promise of their Mettle:
1936   <D {Low March within}.>
1937   But when they should endure the bloody Spurre,
1938   They fall their Crests, and like deceitfull Iades
1939   Sinke in the Triall. Comes his Army on?
1940  *<S {Lucil}.> They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter'd:
1941   The greater part, the Horse in generall
1942   Are come with {Cassius}.
1943   <D {Enter Cassius and his Powers}.>
1944   <S {Bru}.> Hearke, he is arriu'd:
1945   March gently on to meete him.
1946   <S {Cassi}.> Stand ho.
1947   <S {Bru}.> Stand ho, speake the word along.
1948   Stand.
1949   Stand.
1950   Stand.
1951  *<S {Cassi}.> Most Noble Brother, you haue done me wrong.
1952   <S {Bru}.> Iudge me you Gods; wrong I mine Enemies?
1953   And if not so, how should I wrong a Brother.
1954  *<S {Cassi}.> {Brutus}, this sober forme of yours, hides wrongs,
1955   And when you do them===
1956   <S {Brut}.> {Cassius}, be content,
1957   Speake your greefes softly, I do know you well.
1958   Before the eyes of both our Armies heere
1959   (Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs)
1960   Let vs not wrangle. Bid them moue away:
1961   Then in my Tent {Cassius} enlarge your Greefes,
1962   And I will giue you Audience.
1963   <S {Cassi}.> {Pindarus},
1964   Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off
1965   A little from this ground.
1966   <S {Bru}.> {Lucillius}, do you the like, and let no man
1967   Come to our Tent, till we haue done our Conference.
1968   Let {Lucius} and {Titinius} guard our doore.  <D {Exeunt}>
1969   <D {Manet Brutus and Cassius}.>
1970  *<S {Cassi}.> That you haue wrong'd me, doth appear in this:
1971   You haue condemn'd, and noted {Lucius Pella}
1972   For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians;
1973   Wherein  my Letters, praying on his side,
1974   Because I knew the man was slighted off.
1975  *<S {Bru}.> You wrong'd your selfe to write in such a case.
1976   <S {Cassi}.> In such a time as this, it is not meet
1977   That euery nice offence should beare his Comment.
1978   <S {Bru}.> Let me tell you {Cassius}, you your selfe
1979   Are much condemn'd to haue an itching Palme,
1980   To sell, and Mart your Offices for Gold
1981   To Vndeseruers.
1982   <S {Cassi}.> I, an itching Palme?
1983   You know that you are {Brutus} that speakes this,
1984   Or by the Gods, this speech were else your last.
1985   <S {Bru}.> The name of {Cassius} Honors this corruption,
1986   And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head.
1987   <S {Cassi}.> Chasticement?
1988  *<S {Bru}.> Remember March, the Ides of March reme[m]ber:
1989   Did not great {Iulius} bleede for Iustice sake?
1990   What Villaine touch'd his body, that did stab,
1991   And not for Iustice? What? Shall one of Vs,
1992   That strucke the Formost man of all this World,
1993   But for supporting Robbers: shall we now,
1994   Contaminate our fingers, with base Bribes?
1995   And sell the mighty space of our large Honors
1996   For so much trash, as may be grasped thus?
1997   I had rather be a Dogge, and bay the Moone,
1998   Then such a Roman.
1999   <S {Cassi}.> {Brutus}, baite not me,
2000   Ile not indure it: you forget your selfe
2001   To hedge me in. I am a Souldier, I,
2002   Older in practice, Abler then your selfe
2003   To make Conditions.
2004   <S {Bru}.> Go #too: you are not {Cassius}.
2005   <S {Cassi}.> I am.
2006   <S {Bru}.> I say, you are not.
2007   <S {Cassi}.> Vrge me no more, I shall forget my selfe:
2008   Haue minde vpon your health: Tempt me no farther.
2009   <S {Bru}.> Away slight man.
2010   <S {Cassi}.> Is't possible?
2011   <S {Bru}.> Heare me, for I will speake.
2012   Must I giue way, and roome to your rash Choller?
2013   Shall I be frighted, when a Madman stares?
2014   <S {Cassi}.> O ye Gods, ye Gods, Must I endure all this?
2015  *<S {Bru}.> All this? #I more: Fret till your proud hart break.
2016   Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are,
2017   And make your Bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
2018   Must I obserue you? Must I stand and crouch
2019   Vnder your Testie Humour? By the Gods,
2020   You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene
2021   Though it do Split you. For, from this day forth,
2022   Ile vse you for my Mirth, yea for my Laughter
2023   When you are Waspish.
2024   <S {Cassi}.> Is it come to this?
2025   <S {Bru}.> You say, you are a better Souldier:
2026   Let it appeare so; make your vaunting true,
2027   And it shall please me well. For mine owne part,
2028   I shall be glad to learne of Noble men.
2029   <S {Cass}.> You wrong me euery way:
2030   You wrong me {Brutus}:
2031   I saide, an Elder Souldier, not a Better.
2032   Did I say Better?
2033   <S {Bru}.> If you did, I care not.
2034  *<S {Cass}.> When {Caesar} liu'd, he durst not thus haue mou'd |(me.
2035  *<S {Brut}.> Peace, peace, you durst not so haue tempted him.
      <P ll3><C W>
2036   <S {Cassi}.> I durst not.
2037   <S {Bru}.> No.
2038   <S {Cassi}.> What? durst not tempt him?
2039   <S {Bru}.> For your life you durst not.
2040   <S {Cassi}.> Do not presume too much vpon my Loue,
2041   I may do that I shall be sorry for.
2042   <S {Bru}.> You haue done that you should be sorry for.
2043   There is no terror {Cassius} in your threats:
2044   For I am Arm'd so strong in Honesty,
2045   That they passe by me, as the idle winde,
2046   Which I respect not. I did send to you
2047   For certaine summes of Gold, which you deny'd me,
2048   For I can raise no money by vile meanes:
2049   By Heauen, I had rather Coine my Heart,
2050   And drop my blood for Drachmaes, then to wring
2051   From the hard hands of Peazants, their vile trash
2052   By any indirection. I did send
2053   To you for Gold to pay my Legions,
2054   Which you deny'd me: was that done like {Cassius}?
2055   Should I haue answer'd {Caius Cassius} so?
2056   When {Marcus Brutus} growes so Couetous,
2057   To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends,
2058   Be ready Gods with all your Thunder- bolts,
2059   Dash him to peeces.
2060   <S {Cassi}.> I deny'd you not.
2061   <S {Bru}.> You did.
2062   <S {Cassi}.> I did not. He was but a Foole
2063  *That brought my answer back. {Brutus} hath riu'd my hart:
2064   A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities;
2065   But {Brutus} makes mine greater then they are.
2066   <S {Bru}.> I do not, till you practice them on me.
2067   <S {Cassi}.> You loue me not.
2068   <S {Bru}.> I do not like your faults.
2069   <S {Cassi}.> A friendly eye could neuer see such faults.
2070  *<S {Bru}.> A Flatterers would not, though they do appeare
2071   As huge as high Olympus.
2072   <S {Cassi}.> Come {Antony}, and yong {Octauius} come,
2073   Reuenge your selues alone on {Cassius},
2074   For {Cassius} is a- weary of the World:
2075   Hated by one he loues, brau'd by his Brother,
2076   Check'd like a bondman, all his faults obseru'd,
2077   Set in a Note- booke, learn'd, and con'd by roate
2078   To cast into my Teeth. O I could weepe
2079   My Spirit from mine eyes. There is my Dagger,
2080   And heere my naked Breast: Within, a Heart
2081   Deerer then {Pluto's} #Mine, Richer then Gold:
2082   If that thou bee'st a Roman, take it foorth.
2083   I that deny'd thee Gold, will giue my Heart:
2084   Strike as thou did'st at {Caesar}: For I know,
2085   When thou did'st hate him worst, y loued'st him better
2086   Then euer thou loued'st {Cassius}.
2087   <S {Bru}.> Sheath your Dagger:
2088   Be angry when you will, it shall haue scope:
2089   Do what you will, Dishonor, shall be Humour.
2090   O {Cassius}, you are yoaked with a Lambe
2091   That carries Anger, as the Flint beares fire,
2092   Who much inforced, shewes a hastie Sparke,
2093   And straite is cold agen.
2094   <S {Cassi}.> Hath {Cassius} liu'd
2095   To be but Mirth and Laughter to his {Brutus},
2096   When greefe and blood #ill temper'd, vexeth him?
2097   <S {Bru}.> When I spoke that, I was #ill temper'd too.
2098  *<S {Cassi}.> Do you confesse so much? Giue me your hand.
2099   <S {Bru}.> And my heart too.
2100   <S {Cassi}.> O {Brutus}!
2101   <S {Bru}.> What's the matter?
2102   <S {Cassi}.> Haue not you loue enough to beare with me,
2103   When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me
2104   Makes me forgetfull.
2105   <S {Bru}.> Yes {Cassius}, and from henceforth
2106   When you are ouer- earnest with your {Brutus},
2107   Hee'l thinke your Mother chides, and leaue you so.
2108   <D {Enter a Poet}.>
2109   <S {Poet}.> Let me go in to see the Generals,
2110   There is some grudge betweene 'em, 'tis not meete
2111   They be alone.
2112   <S {Lucil}.> You shall not come to them.
2113   <S {Poet}.> Nothing but death shall stay me.
2114   <S {Cas}.> How now? What's the matter?
2115  *<S {Poet}.> For shame you Generals; what do you meane?
2116   Loue, and be Friends, as two such men should bee,
2117   For I haue seene more yeeres I'me sure then yee.
2118   <S {Cas}.> Ha, ha, how vildely doth this Cynicke rime?
2119   <S {Bru}.> Get you hence sirra: Sawcy Fellow, hence.
2120   <S {Cas}.> Beare with him {Brutus}, 'tis his fashion.
2121  *<S {Brut}.> Ile know his humor, when he knowes his time:
2122  *What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles?
2123   Companion, hence.
2124   <S {Cas}.> Away, away be gone.  <D {Exit Poet}>
2125   <S {Bru}.> {Lucillius} and {Titinius} bid the Commanders
2126   Prepare to lodge their Companies to night.
2127  *<S {Cas}.> And come your selues, & bring {Messala} with you
2128   Immediately to vs.
2129   <S {Bru}.> {Lucius}, a bowle of Wine.
2130   <S {Cas}.> I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry.
2131   <S {Bru}.> O {Cassius}, I am sicke of many greefes.
2132   <S {Cas}.> Of your Philosophy you make no vse,
2133   If you giue place to accidentall euils.
2134   <S {Bru}.> No man beares sorrow better. {Portia} is dead.
2135   <S {Cas}.> Ha? {Portia}?
2136   <S {Bru}.> She is dead.
2137   <S {Cas}.> How scap'd I killing, when I crost you so?
2138   O insupportable, and touching losse!
2139   Vpon what sicknesse?
2140   <S {Bru}.> Impatient of my absence,
2141   And greefe, that yong {Octauius} with {Mark Antony}
2142   Haue made themselues so strong: For with her death
2143   That tydings came. With this she fell distract,
2144   And (her Attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
2145   <S {Cas}.> And dy'd so?
2146   <S {Bru}.> Euen so.
2147   <S {Cas}.> O ye immortall Gods!
2148   <D {Enter Boy with Wine, and Tapers}.>
2149  *<S {Bru}.> Speak no more of her: Giue me a bowl of wine,
2150   In this I bury all vnkindnesse {Cassius}.  <D {Drinkes}>
2151   <S {Cas}.> My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge.
2152   Fill {Lucius}, till the Wine ore- swell the Cup:
2153   I cannot drinke too much of {Brutus} loue.
2154   <D {Enter Titinius and Messala}.>
2155   <S {Brutus}.> Come in {Titinius}:
2156   Welcome good {Messala}:
2157   Now sit we close about this Taper heere,
2158   And call in question our necessities.
2159   <S {Cass}.> {Portia}, art thou gone?
2160   <S {Bru}.> No more I pray you.
2161   {Messala}, I haue heere receiued Letters,
2162   That yong {Octauius}, and {Marke Antony}
2163   Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power,
2164   Bending their Expedition toward {Philippi}.
      <P ll3v><C B>
2165  *<S {Mess}.> My selfe haue Letters of the selfe- same Tenure.
2166   <S {Bru}.> With what Addition.
2167   <S {Mess}.> That by proscription, and billes of Outlarie,
2168   {Octauius}, {Antony}, and {Lepidus},
2169   Haue put to death, an hundred Senators.
2170   <S {Bru}.> Therein our Letters do not well agree:
2171   Mine speake of seuenty Senators, that dy'de
2172   By their proscriptions, {Cicero} being one.
2173   <S {Cassi}.> {Cicero} one?
2174  *<S {Messa}.> {Cicero} is dead, and by that order of proscription
2175   Had you your Letters from your wife, my Lord?
2176   <S {Bru}.> No {Messala}.
2177   <S {Messa}.> Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her?
2178   <S {Bru}.> Nothing {Messala}.
2179   <S {Messa}.> That me thinkes is strange.
2180   <S {Bru}.> Why aske you?
2181   Heare you ought of her, in yours?
2182   <S {Messa}.> No my Lord.
2183   <S {Bru}.> Now as you are a Roman tell me true.
2184   <S {Messa}.> Then like a Roman, beare the truth I tell,
2185   For certaine she is dead, and by strange manner.
2186   <S {Bru}.> Why farewell {Portia}: We must die {Messala}:
2187   With meditating that she must dye once,
2188   I haue the patience to endure it now.
2189  *<S {Messa}.> Euen so great men, great losses shold indure.
2190   <S {Cassi}.> I haue as much of this in #Art as you,
2191   But yet my Nature could not beare it so.
2192   <S {Bru}.> Well, to our worke aliue. What do you thinke
2193   Of marching to {Philippi} presently.
2194   <S {Cassi}.> I do not thinke it good.
2195   <S {Bru}.> Your reason?
2196   <S {Cassi}.> This it is:
2197   'Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs,
2198   So shall he waste his meanes, weary his Souldiers,
2199   Doing himselfe offence, whil'st we lying still,
2200   Are full of rest, defence, and nimblenesse.
2201  *<S {Bru}.> Good reasons must of force giue place to better:
2202   The people 'twixt {Philippi}, and this ground
2203   Do stand but in a forc'd affection:
2204   For they haue grug'd vs Contribution.
2205   The Enemy, marching along by them,
2206   By them shall make a fuller number vp,
2207   Come on refresht, new added, and encourag'd:
2208   From which aduantage shall we cut him off.
2209   If at {Philippi} we do face him there,
2210   These people at our backe.
2211   <S {Cassi}.> Heare me good Brother.
2212   <S {Bru}.> Vnder your pardon. You must note beside,
2213   That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends:
2214   Our Legions are brim full, our cause is ripe,
2215   The Enemy encreaseth euery day,
2216   We at the height, are readie to decline.
2217   There is a Tide in the affayres of men,
2218   Which taken at the Flood, leades on to Fortune:
2219   Omitted, all the voyage of their life,
2220   Is bound in Shallowes, and in Miseries.
2221   On such a full Sea are we now a- float,
2222   And we must take the current when it serues,
2223   Or loose our Ventures.
2224   <S {Cassi}.> Then with your #will go on: wee'l along
2225   Our selues, and meet them at {Philippi}.
2226   <S {Bru}.> The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke,
2227   And Nature must obey Necessitie,
2228   Which we will niggard with a little rest:
2229   There is no more to say.
2230   <S {Cassi}.> No more, good night,
2231   Early to morrow will we rise, and hence.
2232   <D {Enter Lucius}.>
2233   <S {Bru}.> {Lucius} my Gowne: farewell good {Messala},
2234   Good night {Titinius}: Noble, Noble {Cassius},
2235   Good night, and good repose.
2236   <S {Cassi}.> O my deere Brother:
2237   This was an #ill beginning of the night:
2238   Neuer come such diuision 'tweene our soules:
2239   Let it not {Brutus}.
2240   <D {Enter Lucius with the Gowne}.>
2241   <S {Bru}.> Euery thing is well.
2242   <S {Cassi}.> Good night my Lord.
2243   <S {Bru}.> Good night good Brother.
2244   <S {Tit}. {Messa}.> Good night Lord {Brutus}.
2245   <S {Bru}.> Farwell euery one.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2246   Giue me the Gowne. Where is thy Instrument?
2247   <S {Luc}.> Heere in the Tent.
2248   <S {Bru}.> What, thou speak'st drowsily?
2249   Poore knaue I blame thee not, thou art ore- watch'd.
2250   Call {Claudio}, and some other of my men,
2251   Ile haue them sleepe on Cushions in my Tent.
2252   <S {Luc}.> {Varrus}, and {Claudio}.
2253   <D {Enter Varrus and Claudio}.>
2254   <S {Var}.> Cals my Lord?
2255   <S {Bru}.> I pray you sirs, lye in my Tent and sleepe,
2256   It may be I shall raise you #by and by
2257   On businesse to my Brother {Cassius}.
2258   <S {Var}.> So please you, we will stand,
2259   And watch your pleasure.
2260   <S {Bru}.> I will it not haue it so: Lye downe good sirs,
2261   It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me.
2262   Looke {Lucius}, heere's the booke I sought for so:
2263   I put it in the pocket of my Gowne.
2264   <S {Luc}.> I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me.
2265  *<S {Bru}.> Beare with me good Boy, I am much forgetfull.
2266   Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a- while,
2267   And touch thy Instrument a straine or two.
2268   <S {Luc}.> #I my Lord, an't please you.
2269   <S {Bru}.> It does my Boy:
2270   I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
2271   <S {Luc}.> It is my duty Sir.
2272   <S {Brut}.> I should not vrge thy duty past thy #might,
2273   I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest.
2274   <S {Luc}.> I haue slept my Lord already.
2275   <S {Bru}.> It was well done, and thou shalt sleepe againe:
2276   I will not hold thee long. If I do liue,
2277   I will be good to thee.
2278   <D {Musicke, and a Song}.>
2279   This is a sleepy Tune: O Murd'rous slumber!
2280   Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy,
2281   That playes thee Musicke? Gentle knaue good night:
2282   I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
2283   If thou do'st nod, thou break'st thy Instrument,
2284   Ile take it from thee, and (good Boy) good night.
2285   Let me see, let me see; is not the Leafe turn'd downe
2286   Where I left reading? Heere it is I thinke.
2287   <D {Enter the Ghost of Caesar}.>
2288   How #ill this Taper burnes. Ha! Who comes heere?
2289   I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes
2290   That shapes this monstrous Apparition.
2291   It comes vpon me: Art thou any thing?
2292   Art thou some God, some Angell, or some Diuell,
2293   That mak'st my blood cold, and my haire to stare?
2294   Speake to me, what thou art.
2295   <S {Ghost}.> Thy euill Spirit {Brutus}?
2296   <S {Bru}.> Why com'st thou?
      <P ll4>
2297   <S {Ghost}.> To tell thee thou shalt see me at {Philippi}.
2298   <S {Brut}.> Well: then I shall see thee againe?
2299   <S {Ghost}.> #I, at {Philippi}.
2300   <S {Brut}.> Why I will see thee at {Philippi} then:
2301   Now I haue taken heart, thou vanishest.
2302   #Ill Spirit, I would hold more talke with thee.
2303   Boy, {Lucius, Varrus, Claudio}, Sirs: Awake:
2304   {Claudio}.
2305   <S {Luc}.> The strings my Lord, are false.
2306   <S {Bru}.> He thinkes he still is at his Instrument.
2307   {Lucius}, awake.
2308   <S {Luc}.> My Lord.
2309  *<S {Bru}.> Did'st thou dreame {Lucius}, that thou so cryedst
2310   out?
2311   <S {Luc}.> My Lord, I do not know that I did cry.
2312  *<S {Bru}.> Yes that thou did'st: Did'st thou see any thing?
2313   <S {Luc}.> Nothing my Lord.
2314   <S {Bru}.> Sleepe againe {Lucius}: Sirra {Claudio}, Fellow,
2315   Thou: Awake.
2316   <S {Var}.> My Lord.
2317   <S {Clau}.> My Lord.
2318   <S {Bru}.> Why did you so cry out sirs, in your sleepe?
2319   <S {Both}.> Did we my Lord?
2320   <S {Bru}.> #I: saw you any thing?
2321   <S {Var}.> No my Lord, I saw nothing.
2322   <S {Clau}.> Nor I my Lord.
2323   <S {Bru}.> Go, and commend me to my Brother {Cassius}:
2324   Bid him set on his Powres betimes before,
2325   And we will follow.
2326   <S {Both}.> It shall be done my Lord.  <D {Exeunt}>
2327   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2328   <D {Enter Octauius, Antony, and their Army}.>
2329   <S {Octa}.> Now {Antony}, our hopes are answered,
2330   You said the Enemy would not come downe,
2331   But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions:
2332   It proues not so: their battailes are at hand,
2333   They meane to warne vs at {Philippi} heere:
2334   Answering before we do demand of them.
2335   <S {Ant}.> Tut I am in their bosomes, and I know
2336   Wherefore they do it: They could be content
2337   To visit other places, and come downe
2338   With fearefull brauery: thinking by this face
2339   To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage;
2340   But 'tis not so.
2341   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2342   <S {Mes}.> Prepare you Generals,
2343   The Enemy comes on in gallant shew:
2344   Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out,
2345   And something to be done immediately.
2346   <S {Ant}.> {Octauius}, leade your Battaile softly on
2347   Vpon the left hand of the euen Field.
2348   <S {Octa}.> Vpon the right hand I, keepe thou the left.
2349   <S {Ant}.> Why do you crosse me in this exigent.
2350   <S {Octa}.> I do not crosse you: but I will do so.  <D {March}.>
2351   <D {Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, & their Army}.>
2352   <S {Bru}.> They stand, and would haue parley.
2353   <S {Cassi}.> Stand fast {Titinius}, we must out and talke.
2354  *<S {Octa}.> {Mark Antony}, shall we giue signe of Battaile?
2355   <S {Ant}.> No {Caesar}, we will answer on their Charge.
2356   Make forth, the Generals would haue some words.
2357   <S {Oct}.> Stirre not vntill the Signall.
2358   <S {Bru}.> Words before blowes: is it so Countrymen?
2359   <S {Octa}.> Not that we loue words better, as you do.
2360  *<S {Bru}.> Good words are better then bad strokes {Octauius}.
2361  *<S {An}.> In  your bad strokes {Brutus}, you giue good words
2362   Witnesse the hole you made in {Caesars} heart,
2363   Crying long liue, Haile {Caesar}.
2364   <S {Cassi}.> {Antony},
2365   The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne;
2366   But for your words, they rob the {Hibla} Bees,
2367   And leaue them Hony- lesse.
2368   <S {Ant}.> Not stinglesse too.
2369   <S {Bru}.> O yes, and soundlesse too:
2370   For you haue stolne their buzzing {Antony},
2371   And very wisely threat before you sting.
2372  *<S {Ant}.> Villains: you did not so, when your vile daggers
2373   Hackt one another in the sides of {Caesar}:
2374   You shew'd your teethes like Apes,
2375   And fawn'd like Hounds,
2376   And bow'd like Bondmen, kissing {Caesars} feete;
2377   Whil'st damned {Caska}, like a Curre, behinde
2378   Strooke {Caesar} on the necke. O you Flatterers.
2379   <S {Cassi}.> Flatterers? Now {Brutus} thanke your selfe,
2380   This tongue had not offended so to day.
2381   If {Cassius} might haue rul'd.
2382  *<S {Octa}.> Come, come, the cause. If arguing make vs swet,
2383   The proofe of it will turne to redder drops:
2384   Looke, I draw a Sword against Conspirators,
2385   When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe?
2386   Neuer till {Caesars} three and thirtie wounds
2387   Be well aueng'd; or till another {Caesar}
2388   Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors.
2389   <S {Brut}.> {Caesar}, thou canst not dye by Traitors hands.
2390   Vnlesse thou bring'st them with thee.
2391   <S {Octa}.> So I hope:
2392   I was not borne to dye on {Brutus} Sword.
2393   <S {Bru}.> O if thou wer't the Noblest of thy Straine,
2394   Yong- man, thou could'st not dye more honourable.
2395  *<S {Cassi}.> A peeuish School- boy, worthles of such Honor
2396   Ioyn'd with a Masker, and a Reueller.
2397   <S {Ant}.> Old {Cassius} still.
2398   <S {Octa}.> Come {Antony}: away:
2399   Defiance Traitors, hurle we in your teeth.
2400   If you dare fight to day, come to the Field;
2401   If not, when you haue stomackes.
2402   <D {Exit Octauius, Antony, and Army}>
2403   <S {Cassi}.> Why now blow winde, swell Billow,
2404   And swimme Barke:
2405   The Storme is vp, and all is on the hazard.
2406   <S {Bru}.> Ho {Lucillius}, hearke, a word with you.
2407   <D {Lucillius and Messala stand forth}.>
2408   <S {Luc}.> My Lord.
2409   <S {Cassi}.> {Messala}.
2410   <S {Messa}.> What sayes my Generall?
2411  *<S {Cassi}.> {Messala}, this is my Birth- day: at this very day
2412   Was {Cassius} borne. Giue me thy hand {Messala}:
2413   Be thou my witnesse, that against my #will
2414   (As {Pompey} was) am I compell'd to set
2415   Vpon one Battell all our Liberties.
2416   You know, that I held {Epicurus} strong,
2417   And his Opinion: Now I change my minde,
2418   And partly credit things that do presage.
2419   Comming from {Sardis}, on our former Ensigne
2420   Two mighty Eagles fell, and there they pearch'd,
2421   Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands,
      <P ll4v>
2422   Who to {Philippi} heere consorted vs:
2423   This Morning are they fled away, and gone,
2424   And in their steeds, do Rauens, Crowes, and Kites
2425   Fly ore our heads, and downward looke on vs
2426   As we were sickely prey; their shadowes seeme
2427   A Canopy most fatall, vnder which
2428   Our Army lies, ready to giue vp the Ghost.
2429   <S {Messa}.> Beleeue not so.
2430   <S {Cassi}.> I but beleeue it partly,
2431   For I am fresh of spirit, and resolu'd
2432   To meete all perils, very constantly.
2433   <S {Bru}.> Euen so {Lucillius}.
2434   <S {Cassi}.> Now most Noble {Brutus},
2435   The Gods to day stand friendly, that we may
2436   Louers in peace, leade on our dayes to age.
2437   But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine,
2438   Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
2439   If we do lose this Battaile, then is this
2440   The very last time we shall speake together:
2441   What are you then determined to do?
2442   <S {Bru}.> Euen by the rule of that Philosophy,
2443   By which I did blame {Cato}, for the death
2444   Which he did giue himselfe, I know not how:
2445   But I do finde it Cowardly, and vile,
2446   For feare of what might fall, so to preuent
2447   The time of life, arming my selfe with patience,
2448   To stay the prouidence of some high Powers,
2449   That gouerne vs below.
2450   <S {Cassi}.> Then, if we loose this Battaile,
2451   You are contented to be led in Triumph
2452   Thorow the streets of Rome.
2453   <S {Bru}.> No {Cassius}, no:
2454   Thinke not thou Noble Romane,
2455   That euer {Brutus} will go bound to Rome,
2456   He beares too great a minde. But this same day
2457   Must end that worke, the Ides of March begun.
2458   And whether we shall meete againe, I know not:
2459   Therefore our euerlasting farewell take:
2460   For euer, and for euer, farewell {Cassius},
2461   If we do meete againe, why we shall smile;
2462   If not, why then this parting was well made.
2463   <S {Cassi}.> For euer, and for euer, farewell {Brutus}:
2464   If we do meete againe, wee'l smile indeede;
2465   If not, 'tis true, this parting was well made.
2466  *<S {Bru}.> Why then leade on. O that a man might know
2467   The end of this dayes businesse, ere it come:
2468   But it sufficeth, that the day will end,
2469   And then the end is knowne. Come ho, away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2470   <D {Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala}.>
2471   <S {Bru}.> Ride, ride {Messala}, ride and giue these Billes
2472   Vnto the Legions, on the other side.
2473   <D {Lowd Alarum}.>
2474   Let them set on at once: for I perceiue
2475   But cold demeanor in {Octauio's} wing:
2476   And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow:
2477   Ride, ride {Messala}, let them all come downe.  <D {Exeunt}>
2478   <D {Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius}.>
2479   <S {Cassi}.> O looke {Titinius}, looke, the Villaines flye:
2480   My selfe haue to mine owne turn'd Enemy:
2481   This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe,
2482   I slew the Coward, and did take it from him.
2483   <S {Titin}.> O {Cassius}, {Brutus} gaue the word too early,
2484   Who hauing some aduantage on {Octauius},
2485   Tooke it too eagerly: his Soldiers fell to spoyle,
2486   Whilst we by {Antony} are all inclos'd.
2487   <D {Enter Pindarus}.>
2488   <S {Pind}.> Fly further off my Lord: flye further off,
2489   {Mark Antony} is in your Tents my Lord:
2490   Flye therefore Noble {Cassius}, flye farre off.
2491  *<S {Cassi}.> This Hill is farre enough. Looke, look {Titinius}
2492   Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire?
2493   <S {Tit}.> They are, my Lord.
2494   <S {Cassi}.> {Titinius}, if thou louest me,
2495   Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurres in him,
2496   Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes
2497   And heere againe, that I may rest assur'd
2498   Whether yond Troopes, are Friend or Enemy.
2499  *<S {Tit}.> I will be heere againe, euen with a thought.  <D {Exit}.>
2500   <S {Cassi}.> Go {Pindarus}, get higher on that hill,
2501   My sight was euer thicke: regard {Titinius},
2502   And tell me what thou not'st about the Field.
2503   This day I breathed first, Time is come round,
2504   And where I did begin, there shall I end,
2505   My life is run his compasse. Sirra, what newes?
2506   <S {Pind}. {Aboue}.> O my Lord.
2507   <S {Cassi}.> What newes?
2508   <S {Pind}.> {Titinius} is enclosed round about
2509   With Horsemen, that make to him on the Spurre,
2510   Yet he spurres on. Now they are almost on him:
2511   Now {Titinius}. Now some light: O he lights too.
2512   Hee's tane.  <D {Showt}.>
2513   And hearke, they shout for ioy.
2514   <S {Cassi}.> Come downe, behold no more:
2515   O Coward that I am, to liue so long,
2516   To see my best Friend tane before my face
2517   <D {Enter Pindarus}.>
2518   Come hither sirrah: In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner,
2519   And then I swore thee, sauing of thy life,
2520   That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do,
2521  *Thou should'st attempt it. Come now, keepe thine oath,
2522   Now be a Free- man, and with this good Sword
2523   That ran through {Caesars} bowels, search this bosome.
2524   Stand not to answer: Heere, take thou the Hilts,
2525   And when my face is couer'd, as 'tis now,
2526   Guide thou the Sword=== {Caesar}, thou art reueng'd,
2527   Euen with the Sword that kill'd thee.
2528   <S {Pin}.> So, I am free,
2529   Yet would not so haue beene
2530   Durst I haue done my #will. O {Cassius},
2531   Farre from this Country {Pindarus} shall run,
2532   Where neuer Roman shall take note of him.
2533   <D {Enter Titinius and Messala}.>
2534   <S {Messa}.> It is but change, {Titinius}: for {Octauius}
2535   Is ouerthrowne by Noble {Brutus} power,
2536   As {Cassius} Legions are by {Antony}.
2537   <S {Titin}.> These tydings will well comfort {Cassius}.
2538   <S {Messa}.> Where did you leaue him.
2539   <S {Titin}.> All disconsolate,
2540   With {Pindarus} his Bondman, on this Hill.
2541   <S {Messa}.> Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground?
2542   <S {Titin}.> He lies not like the Liuing. O my heart!
2543   <S {Messa}.> Is not that hee?
2544   <S {Titin}.> No, this was he {Messala},
2545   But {Cassius} is no more. O setting Sunne:
2546   As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night;
      <P ll5>
2547   So in his red blood {Cassius} day is set.
2548   The Sunne of Rome is set. Our day is gone,
2549  *Clowds, Dewes, and Dangers come; our deeds are done:
2550   Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed.
2551  *<S {Messa}.> Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed.
2552   O hatefull Error, Melancholies Childe:
2553   Why do'st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men
2554   The things that are not? O Error soone conceyu'd,
2555   Thou neuer com'st vnto a happy byrth,
2556   But kil'st the Mother that engendred thee.
2557   <S {Tit}.> What {Pindarus}? Where art thou {Pindarus}?
2558   <S {Messa}.> Seeke him {Titinius}, whilst I go to meet
2559   The Noble {Brutus}, thrusting this report
2560   Into his eares; I may say thrusting it:
2561   For piercing Steele, and Darts inuenomed,
2562   Shall be as welcome to the eares of {Brutus},
2563   As tydings of this sight.
2564   <S {Tit}.> Hye you {Messala},
2565   And I will seeke for {Pindarus} the while:
2566   Why did'st thou send me forth braue {Cassius}?
2567   Did I not meet thy Friends, and did not they
2568   Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie,
2569   And bid me giue it thee? Did'st thou not heare their |(showts?
2570   Alas, thou hast misconstrued euery thing.
2571   But hold thee, take this Garland on thy Brow,
2572   Thy {Brutus} bid me giue it thee, and I
2573   Will do his bidding. {Brutus}, come apace,
2574   And see how I regarded {Caius Cassius}:
2575   By your leaue Gods: This is a Romans part,
2576   Come {Cassius} Sword, and finde {Titinius} hart.  <D {Dies}>
2577   <D {Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, yong Cato},
2578   {Strato, Volumnius, and Lucillius}.>
2579   <S {Bru}.> Where, where {Messala}, doth his body lye?
2580   <S {Messa}.> Loe yonder, and {Titinius} mourning it.
2581   <S {Bru}.> {Titinius} face is vpward.
2582   <S {Cato}.> He is slaine.
2583   <S {Bru}.> O {Iulius Caesar}, thou art mighty yet,
2584   Thy Spirit walkes abroad, and turnes our Swords
2585   In our owne proper Entrailes.  {Low Alarums}.
2586   <S {Cato}.> Braue {Titinius},
2587   Looke where he haue not crown'd dead {Cassius}.
2588   <S {Bru}.> Are yet two Romans liuing such as these?
2589   The last of all the Romans, far thee well:
2590   It is impossible, that euer Rome
2591   Should breed thy fellow. Friends I owe mo teares
2592   To this dead man, then you shall see me pay.
2593   I shall finde time, {Cassius}: I shall finde time.
2594   Come therefore, and to {Tharsus} send his body,
2595   His Funerals shall not be in our Campe,
2596   Least it discomfort vs. {Lucillius} come,
2597   And come yong {Cato}, let vs to the Field,
2598   {Labio} and {Flauio} set our Battailes on:
2599   'Tis three #a clocke, and Romans yet ere night,
2600   We shall try Fortune in a second fight.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2601   <D {Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, Cato, Lucillius},
2602   {and Flauius}.>
2603  *<S {Bru}.> Yet Country- men: O yet, hold vp your heads.
2604  *<S {Cato}.> What Bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
2605   I will proclaime my name about the Field.
2606   I am the Sonne of {Marcus Cato}, hoe.
2607   A Foe to Tyrants, and my Countries Friend.
2608   I am the Sonne of {Marcus Cato}, hoe.
2609   <D {Enter Souldiers, and fight}.>
2610   And I am {Brutus, Marcus Brutus}, I,
2611   {Brutus} my Countries Friend: Know me for {Brutus}.
2612   <S {Luc}.> O yong and Noble {Cato}, art thou downe?
2613   Why now thou dyest, as brauely as {Titinius},
2614   And may'st be honour'd, being {Cato's} Sonne.
2615   <S {Sold}.> Yeeld, or thou dyest.
2616   <S {Luc}.> Onely I yeeld to dye:
2617   There is so much, that thou wilt kill me straight:
2618   Kill {Brutus}, and be honour'd in his death.
2619   <S {Sold}.> We must not: a Noble Prisoner.
2620   <D {Enter Antony}.>
2621   <S 2.{Sold}.> Roome hoe: tell {Antony}, {Brutus} is tane.
2622  *<S 1.{Sold}.> Ile tell thee newes. Heere comes the Generall,
2623   {#Brutus} is tane, {Brutus} is tane my Lord.
2624   <S {Ant}.> Where is hee?
2625   <S {Luc}.> Safe {Antony}, {Brutus} is safe enough:
2626   I dare assure thee, that no Enemy
2627   Shall euer take aliue the Noble {Brutus}:
2628   The Gods defend him from so great a shame,
2629   When you do finde him, or aliue, or dead,
2630   He will be found like {Brutus}, like himselfe.
2631   <S {Ant}.> This is not {Brutus} friend, but I assure you,
2632   A prize no lesse in worth; keepe this man safe,
2633   Giue him all kindnesse. I had rather haue
2634   Such men my Friends, then Enemies. Go on,
2635   And see where {Brutus} be aliue or dead,
2636   And bring vs word, vnto {Octauius} Tent:
2637   How euery thing is chanc'd.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <C A>
2638   <D {Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato},
2639   {and Volumnius}.>
2640  *<S {Brut}.> Come poore remaines of friends, rest on this
2641   Rocke.
2642   <S {Clit}.> {Statillius} shew'd the Torch- light, but my Lord
2643   He came not backe: he is or tane, or slaine.
2644   <S {Brut}.> Sit thee downe, {Clitus}: slaying is the word,
2645   It is a deed in fashion. Hearke thee, {Clitus}.
2646   <S {Clit}.> What I, my Lord? No, not for all the World.
2647   <S {Brut}.> Peace then, no words.
2648   <S {Clit}.> Ile rather kill my selfe.
2649   <S {Brut}.> Hearke thee, {Dardanius}.
2650   <S {Dard}.> Shall I doe such a deed?
2651   <S {Clit}.> O {Dardanius}.
2652   <S {Dard}.> O {Clitus}.
2653   <S {Clit}.> What #ill request did {Brutus} make to thee?
2654   <S {Dard}.> To kill him, {Clitus}: looke he meditates.
2655   <S {Clit}.> Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe,
2656   That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes.
2657   <S {Brut}.> Come hither, good {Volumnius}, list a word.
2658   <S {Volum}.> What sayes my Lord?
2659   <S {Brut}.> Why this, {Volumnius}:
2660   The Ghost of {Caesar} hath appear'd to me
2661   Two seuerall times by Night: at Sardis, once;
2662   And this last Night, here in Philippi fields:
2663   I know my houre is come.
2664   <S {Volum}.> Not so, my Lord.
2665   <S {Brut}.> Nay, I am sure it is, {Volumnius}.
2666   Thou seest the World, {Volumnius}, how it goes,
2667   Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit:  <D {Low Alarums}.>
2668   It is more worthy, to leape in our selues,
2669   Then tarry till they push vs. Good {Volumnius},
2670   Thou know'st, that we two went to Schoole together:
2671   Euen for that our loue of old, I prethee
2672   Hold thou my Sword Hilts, whilest I runne on it.
2673   <S {Vol}.> That's not an Office for a friend, my Lord.
2674   <D {Alarum still}.>
      <P ll5v><C B>
2675   <S {Cly}.> Fly, flye my Lord, there is no tarrying heere.
2676   <S {Bru}.> Farewell to you, and you, and {Volumnius}.
2677   {Strato}, thou hast bin all this while asleepe:
2678   Farewell to thee, to {Strato}, Countrymen:
2679   My heart doth ioy, that yet in all my life,
2680   I found no man, but he was true to me.
2681   I shall haue glory by this loosing day
2682   More then {Octauius}, and {Marke Antony},
2683   By this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto.
2684   So fare you well at once, for {Brutus} tongue
2685   Hath almost ended his liues History:
2686   Night hangs vpon mine eyes, my Bones would rest,
2687   That haue but labour'd, to attaine this houre.
2688   <D {Alarum. Cry within, Flye, flye, flye}.>
2689   <S {Cly}.> Fly my Lord, flye.
2690   <S {Bru}.> Hence: I will follow:
2691   I prythee {Strato}, stay thou by thy Lord,
2692   Thou art a Fellow of a good respect:
2693   Thy life hath had some smatch of Honor in it,
2694   Hold then my Sword, and turne away thy face,
2695   While I do run vpon it. Wilt thou {Strato}?
2696  *<S {Stra}.> Giue me your hand first. Fare you wel my Lord.
2697  *<S {Bru}.> Farewell good {Strato}. === {Caesar}, now be still,
2698   I kill'd not thee with halfe so good a #will.  <D {Dyes}.>
2699   <D {Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octauius, Messala},
2700   {Lucillius, and the Army}.>
2701   <S {Octa}.> What man is that?
2702  *<S {Messa}.> My Masters man. {Strato}, where is thy Master?
2703   <S {Stra}.> Free from the Bondage you are in {Messala},
2704   The Conquerors can but make a fire of him:
2705   For {Brutus} onely ouercame himselfe,
2706   And no man else hath Honor by his death.
2707  *<S {Lucil}.> So {Brutus} should be found. I thank thee {Brutus}
2708   That thou hast prou'd {Lucillius} saying true,
2709   <S {Octa}.> All that seru'd {Brutus}, I will entertaine them.
2710   Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
2711   <S {Stra}.> #I, if {Messala} will preferre me to you.
2712   <S {Octa}.> Do so, good {Messala}.
2713   <S {Messa}.> How dyed my Master {Strato}?
2714   <S {Stra}.> I held the Sword, and he did run on it.
2715   <S {Messa}.> {Octauius}, then take him to follow thee,
2716   That did the latest seruice to my Master.
2717   <S {Ant}.> This was the Noblest Roman of them all:
2718   All the Conspirators saue onely hee,
2719   Did that they did, in enuy of great {Caesar}:
2720   He, onely in a generall honest thought,
2721   And common good to all, made one of them.
2722   His life was gentle, and the Elements
2723   So mixt in him, that Nature might stand vp,
2724   And say to all the world; This was a man.
2725   <S {Octa}.> According to his Vertue, let vs vse him
2726   Withall Respect, and Rites of Buriall.
2727   Within my Tent his bones to night shall ly,
2728   Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably:
2729   So call the Field to rest, and let's away,
2730   To part the glories of this happy day.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
