2      <D {Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches}.>
3      <S 1.> When shall we three meet againe?
4      In Thunder, Lightning, or in Raine?
5      <S 2.> When the Hurley- burley's done,
6      When the Battaile's lost, and wonne.
7      <S 3.> That will be ere the set of Sunne.
8      <S 1.> Where the place?
9      <S 2.> Vpon the Heath.
10     <S 3.> There to meet with {Macbeth}.
11     <S 1.> I come, {Gray- Malkin}.
12     <S {All}.> {Padock} calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,
13     Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre.  <D {Exeunt}.>
14     <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
15     <D {Alarum within. Enter King Malcome, Donal-baine},
16     {#Lenox, with attendants, meeting}
17     {a bleeding Captaine}.>
18     <S {King}.> What bloody man is that? he can report,
19     As seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt
20     The newest state.
21     <S {Mal}.> This is the Serieant,
22     Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought
23     'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;
24     Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,
25     As thou didst leaue it.
26     <S {Cap}.> Doubtfull it stood,
27     As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
28     And choake their #Art: The mercilesse {Macdonwald}
29     (Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that
30     The multiplying Villanies of Nature
31     Doe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles
32     Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
33     And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,
34     Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:
35     For braue {Macbeth} (well hee deserues that Name)
36     Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
37     Which smoak'd with bloody execution
38     (Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,
39     Till hee fac'd the Slaue:
40     Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
41     Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,
42     And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements.
43     <S {King}.> O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman.
44     <S {Cap}.> As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
45     Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:
46     So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,
47     Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,
48     No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,
49     Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,
50     But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,
51     With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,
52     Began a fresh assault.
53    *<S {King}.> Dismay'd not this our Captaines, {Macbeth} and
54     {Banquoh}?
55     <S {Cap}.> Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;
56     Or the Hare, the Lyon:
57     If I say sooth, I must report they were
58     As Cannons ouer- charg'd with double Cracks,
59     So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:
60     Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
61     Or memorize another {Golgotha},
62     I cannot tell: but I am faint,
63     My Gashes cry for helpe.
64    *<S {King}.> So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,
65     They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.
66     <D {Enter Rosse and Angus}.>
67     Who comes here?
68     <S {Mal}.> The worthy {Thane} of Rosse.
69     <S {Lenox}.> What a haste lookes through his eyes?
70    *So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange.
71     <S {Rosse}.> God saue the King.
72     <S {King}.> Whence cam'st thou, worthy {Thane}?
73     <S {Rosse}.> From Fiffe, great King,
74     Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
75     And fanne our people cold.
76     {Norway} himselfe, with terrible numbers,
77     Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
78     The {Thane} of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
79     Till that {Bellona's} Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,
80     Confronted him with selfe- comparisons,
81     Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
82     Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,
83     The Victorie fell on vs.
84     <S {King}.> Great happinesse.
85     <S {Rosse}.> That now {Sweno}, the Norwayes King,
86     Craues composition:
87     Nor would we deigne him  buriall of his men,
88     Till he disbursed, at Saint {Colmes} ynch,
89     Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse.
      <P ll6v>
90     <S {King}.> No more that {Thane} of Cawdor shall deceiue
91    *Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,
92     And with his former Title greet {Macbeth}.
93     <S {Rosse}.> Ile see it done.
94    *<S {King}.> What he hath lost, Noble {Macbeth} hath wonne.
95     <D {Exeunt}.>
96     <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
97     <D {Thunder. Enter the three Witches}.>
98     <S 1.> Where hast thou beene, Sister?
99     <S 2.> Killing Swine.
100    <S 3.> Sister, where thou?
101    <S 1.> A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe,
102    And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
103    Giue me, quoth I.
104    Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe- fed Ronyon cryes.
105    Her Husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o'th' {Tiger}:
106    But in a Syue Ile thither sayle,
107    And like a Rat without a tayle,
108    Ile doe, Ile doe, and Ile doe.
109    <S 2.> Ile giue thee a Winde.
110    <S 1.> Th'art kinde.
111    <S 3.> And I another.
112    <S 1.> I my selfe haue all the other,
113    And the very Ports they blow,
114    All the Quarters that they know,
115    I'th' Ship- mans Card.
116    Ile dreyne him drie as Hay:
117    Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day
118    Hang vpon his Pent- house Lid:
119    He shall liue a man forbid:
120    Wearie Seu'nights, nine times nine,
121    Shall he dwindle, peake, and pine:
122    Though his Barke cannot be lost,
123    Yet it shall be Tempest- tost.
124    Looke what I haue.
125    <S 2.> Shew me, shew me.
126    <S 1.> Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe,
127    Wrackt, as homeward he did come.  <D {Drum within}.>
128    <S 3.> A Drumme, a Drumme:
129    {Macbeth} doth come.
130    <S {All}.> The weyward Sisters, hand in hand,
131    Posters of the Sea and Land,
132    Thus doe goe, about, about,
133    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
134    And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
135    Peace, the Charme's wound vp.
136    <D {Enter Macbeth and Banquo}.>
137    <S {Macb}.> So foule and faire a day I haue not seene.
138   *<S {Banquo}.> How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,
139    So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
140    That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
141    And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
142    That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
143    By each at once her choppie finger laying
144    Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
145    And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
146    That you are so.
147    <S {Mac}.> Speake if you can: what are you?
148    <S 1.> All haile {Macbeth}, haile to thee {Thane} of Glamis.
149   *<S 2.> All haile {Macbeth}, haile to thee {Thane} of Cawdor.
150    <S 3.> All haile {Macbeth}, that shalt be King hereafter.
151   *<S {Banq}.> Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
152    Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
153    Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
154    Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
155    You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
156    Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
157    That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
158    If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
159    And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
160    Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare
161    Your fauors, nor your hate.
162    <S 1.> Hayle.
163    <S 2.> Hayle.
164    <S 3.> Hayle.
165    <S 1.> Lesser than {Macbeth}, and greater.
166    <S 2.> Not so happy, yet much happyer.
167    <S 3.> Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:
168    So all haile {Macbeth}, and {Banquo}.
169    <S 1.> {Banquo}, and {Macbeth}, all haile.
170    <S {Macb}.> Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
171    By {Sinells} death, I know I am {Thane} of Glamis,
172    But how, of Cawdor? the {Thane} of Cawdor liues
173    A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
174    Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
175    No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
176    You owe this strange Intelligence, or why
177    Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way
178    With such Prophetique greeting?
179    Speake, I charge you.  <D {Witches vanish}.>
180    <S {Banq}.> The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,
181    And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
182    <S {Macb}.> Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,
183    Melted, as breath into the Winde.
184    Would they had stay'd.
185   *<S {Banq}.> Were such things here, as we doe speake about?
186    Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,
187    That takes the Reason Prisoner?
188    <S {Macb}.> Your Children shall be Kings.
189    <S {Banq}.> You shall be King.
190    <S {Macb}.> And {Thane} of Cawdor too: went it not so?
191    <S {Banq}.> Toth' selfe- same tune and words: who's here?
192    <D {Enter Rosse and Angus}.>
193    <S {Rosse}.> The King hath happily receiu'd, {Macbeth},
194    The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
195    Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
196    His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
197    Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
198    In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe- same day,
199    He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
200    Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
201    Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
202    Can post with post, and euery one did beare
203    Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
204    And powr'd them downe before him.
205    <S {Ang}.> Wee are sent,
206    To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
207    Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
208    Not pay thee.
209    <S {Rosse}.> And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
210    He bad me, from him, call thee {Thane} of Cawdor:
      <P mm1>
211    In which addition, haile most worthy {Thane},
212    For it is thine.
213    <S {Banq}.> What, can the Deuill speake true?
214    <S {Macb}.> The {Thane} of Cawdor liues:
215    Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?
216    <S {Ang}.> Who was the {Thane}, liues yet,
217    But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
218    Which he deserues to loose.
219    Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
220    Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
221    And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
222    In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
223    But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
224    Haue ouerthrowne him.
225    <S {Macb}.> Glamys, and {Thane} of Cawdor:
226    The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
227    Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
228    When those that gaue the {Thane} of Cawdor to me,
229    Promis'd no lesse to them.
230    <S {Banq}.> That trusted home,
231    Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
232    Besides the {Thane} of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
233    And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
234    The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
235    Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
236    In deepest consequence.
237    Cousins, a word, I pray you.
238    <S {Macb}.> Two Truths are told,
239    As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
240    Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
241    This supernaturall solliciting
242    Cannot be #ill; cannot be good.
243    If #ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
244    Commencing in a Truth? I am {Thane} of Cawdor.
245    If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
246    Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
247    And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
248    Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
249    Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
250    My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
251    Shakes so my single state of Man,
252    That Function is smother'd in surmise,
253    And nothing is, but what is not.
254    <S {Banq}.> Looke how our Partner's rapt.
255    <S {Macb}.> If Chance will haue me King,
256    Why Chance may Crowne me,
257    Without my stirre.
258    <S {Banq}.> New Honors come vpon him
259    Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
260    But with the aid of vse.
261    <S {Macb}.> Come what come may,
262    Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day.
263   *<S {Banq}.> Worthy {Macbeth}, wee stay vpon your ley-sure.
264   _
265    <S {Macb}.> Giue me your fauour:
266    My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
267    Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
268    Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
269    To reade them.
270    Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon
271    What hath chanc'd: and at more time,
272    The {Interim} hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake
273    Our free Hearts each to other.
274    <S {Banq}.> Very gladly.
275    <S {Macb}.> Till then enough:
276    Come friends.  <D {Exeunt}.>
277    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
278    <D {Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme},
279    {Donalbaine, and Attendants}.>
280    <S {King}.> Is execution done on {Cawdor}?
281    Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
282    <S {Mal}.> My Liege, they are not yet come back.
283    But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
284    Who did report, that very frankly hee
285   *Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
286    And set forth a deepe Repentance:
287    Nothing in his Life became him,
288    Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
289    As one that had beene studied in his death,
290    To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
291    As 'twere a carelesse Trifle.
292    <S {King}.> There's no #Art,
293    To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
294    He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
295    An absolute Trust.
296    <D {Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus}.>
297    O worthyest Cousin,
298    The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
299    Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
300    That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
301    To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
302    That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
303    Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
304    More is thy due, then more then all can pay.
305    <S {Macb}.> The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
306    In doing it, payes it selfe.
307    Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
308    And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
309   *Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
310    By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
311    And Honor.
312    <S {King}.> Welcome hither:
313    I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
314    To make thee full of growing. Noble {Banquo},
315    That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
316    No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,
317    And hold thee to my Heart.
318    <S {Banq}.> There if I grow,
319    The Haruest is your owne.
320    <S {King}.> My plenteous Ioyes,
321    Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
322    In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, {Thanes},
323    And you whose places are the nearest, know,
324    We will establish our Estate vpon
325    Our eldest, {Malcolme}, whom we name hereafter,
326    The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
327    Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,
328    But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine
329    On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
330    And binde vs further to you.
331    <S {Macb}.> The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:
332    Ile be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull
333    The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
334    So humbly take my leaue.
335    <S {King}.> My worthy {Cawdor}.
336    <S {Macb}.> The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
337    On which I must fall downe, or else o're- leape,
      <P mm1v>
338    For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
339    Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:
340    The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,
341    Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.  <D {Exit}.>
342    <S {King}.> True worthy {Banquo}: he is full so valiant,
343    And in his commendations, I am fed:
344    It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
345    Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:
346    It is a peerelesse Kinsman.  <D {Flourish.  Exeunt}.>
347    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
348    <D {Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter}.>
349   *<S Lady.> {They met me in the day of successe: and I haue}
350   *{learn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then}
351   *{mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them}
352   *{further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd}.
353   *{Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from}
354   *{the King, who all- hail'd me} Thane {of Cawdor, by which Title}
355   *{before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to}
356   *{the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This}
357   *{haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of}
358   *{Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing}
359   *{by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay}
360    {it to thy heart and farewell}.
361    Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
362    What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
363    It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
364    To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
365    Art not without Ambition, but without
366   *The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
367    That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
368    And yet would'st wrongly winne.
369    Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
370    Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
371    And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
372    Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
373    That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
374    And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
375    All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
376    Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
377    To haue thee crown'd withall.  <D {Enter Messenger}.>
378    What is your tidings?
379    <S {Mess}.> The King comes here to Night.
380    <S {Lady}.> Thou'rt mad to say it.
381    Is not thy Master with him? who, #wer't so,
382    Would haue inform'd for preparation.
383    <S {Mess}.> So please you, it is true: our {Thane} is comming:
384    One of my fellowes had the speed of him;
385    Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
386    Then would make vp his Message.
387    <S {Lady}.> Giue him tending,
388    He brings great newes,  <D {Exit Messenger}.>
389    The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,
390    That croakes the fatall entrance of {Duncan}
391    Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
392    That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,
393    And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top- full
394    Of direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
395    Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,
396    That no compunctious visitings of Nature
397    Shake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene
398    Th' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
399    And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,
400    Where- euer, in your sightlesse substances,
401    You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,
402    And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of #Hell,
403    That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,
404    Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,
405    To cry, hold, hold.  <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
406    Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,
407    Greater then both, by the all- haile hereafter,
408    Thy Letters haue transported me beyond
409    This ignorant present, and I feele now
410    The future in the instant.
411    <S {Macb}.> My dearest Loue,
412    {Duncan} comes here to Night.
413    <S {Lady}.> And when goes hence?
414    <S {Macb}.> To morrow, as he purposes.
415    <S {Lady}.> O neuer,
416    Shall Sunne that Morrow see.
417    Your Face, my {Thane}, is as a Booke, where men
418    May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.
419    Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,
420   *Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,
421    But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
422    Must be prouided for: and you shall put
423    This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,
424    Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,
425    Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome.
426    <S {Macb}.> We will speake further,
427    <S {Lady}.> Onely looke vp cleare:
428    To alter fauor, euer is to feare:
429    Leaue all the rest to me.  <D {Exeunt}.>
430    <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
431    <D {Hoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme},
432    {Donalbaine, Banquo, Lenox, Macduff},
433    {Rosse, Angus, and Attendants}.>
434    <S {King}.> This Castle hath a pleasant seat,
435    The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe
436    Vnto our gentle sences.
437    <S {Banq}.> This Guest of Summer,
438    The Temple- haunting Barlet does approue,
439    By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
440    Smells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,
441    Buttrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird
442    Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
443    Where they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd
444    The ayre is delicate.  <D {Enter Lady}.>
445    <S {King}.> See, see our honor'd Hostesse:
446    The Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,
447    Which still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,
448    How you shall bid God- eyld vs for your paines,
449    And thanke vs for your trouble.
450    <S {Lady}.> All our seruice,
451    In euery point twice done, and then done double,
452    Were poore, and single Businesse, to contend
453    Against those Honors deepe, and broad,
454    Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House:
455    For those of old, and the late Dignities,
456    Heap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites.
      <P mm2><C B>
457    <S {King}.> Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
458    We courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose
459    To be his Purueyor: But he rides well,
460   *And his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him
461    To his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse
462    We are your guest to night.
463    <S {La}.> Your Seruants euer,
464    Haue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,
465    To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,
466    Still to returne your owne.
467    <S {King}.> Giue me your hand:
468    Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,
469    And shall continue, our Graces towards him.
470    By your leaue Hostesse.  <D {Exeunt}>
471    <Z {Scena Septima}.>
472    <D {Ho-boyes. Torches}.
473    {Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes and Seruice}
474    {ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth}.>
475   *<S {Macb}.> If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,
476    It were done quickly: If th' Assassination
477    Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
478    With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
479    Might be the #be all, and the end all. Heere,
480    But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,
481    Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,
482    We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
483    Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
484    To plague th' Inuenter, this euen- handed Iustice
485    Commends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice
486    To our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
487    First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,
488    Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
489    Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,
490    Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this {Duncane}
491    Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin
492    So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
493    Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet- tongu'd against
494    The deepe damnation of his taking off:
495    And Pitty, like a naked New- borne- Babe,
496    Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
497    Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
498    Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
499    That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
500    To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
501    Vaulting Ambition, which ore- leapes it selfe,
502    And falles on th' other.  <D {Enter Lady}.>
503    How now? What Newes?
504   *<S {La}.> He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?
505    <S {Mac}.> Hath he ask'd for me?
506    <S {La}.> Know you not, he ha's?
507    <S {Mac}.> We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
508    He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
509    Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
510    Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
511    Not cast aside so soone.
512    <S {La}.> Was the hope drunke,
513    Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
514    And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
515    At what it did so freely? From this time,
516    Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
517    To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
518    As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
519    Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
520    And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
521    Letting I dare not, wait vpon I #would,
522    Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage.
523    <S {Macb}.> Prythee peace:
524    I dare do all that may become a man,
525    Who dares do more, is none.
526    <S {La}.> What Beast #was't then
527    That made you breake this enterprize to me?
528    When you durst do it, then you were a man:
529    And to be more then what you were, you would
530    Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
531    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
532    They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
533    Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
      <C A>
534    How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
535    I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
536    Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
537    And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
538    As you haue done to this.
539    <S {Macb}.> If we should faile?
540    <S {Lady}.> We faile?
541    But screw your courage to the sticking place,
542    And wee'le not fayle: when {Duncan} is asleepe,
543    (Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
544    Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
545    Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
546    That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
547    Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
548    A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
549    Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
550    What cannot you and I performe vpon
551    Th' vnguarded {Duncan}? What not put vpon
552    His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
553    Of our great quell.
554    <S {Macb}.> Bring forth Men- Children onely:
555    For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
556    Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
557    When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
558    Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
559    That they haue don't?
560    <S {Lady}.> Who dares receiue it other,
561    As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
562    Vpon his Death?
563    <S {Macb}.> I am settled, and bend vp
564    Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
565    Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
566    False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.
567    <D {Exeunt}.>
568    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scena Prima}.>
569    <D {Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch}
570    {before him}.>
571    <S {Banq}.> How goes the Night, Boy?
572   *<S {Fleance}.> The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the
573    Clock.
574    <S {Banq}.> And she goes downe at Twelue.
575    <S {Fleance}.> I take't, 'tis later, Sir.
576    <S {Banq}.> Hold, take my Sword:
577    There's Husbandry in Heauen,
578    Their Candles are all out: take thee that too.
      <P mm2v>
579    A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,
580    And yet I would not sleepe:
581    Mercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts
582    That Nature giues way to in repose.
583    <D {Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch}.>
584    Giue me my Sword: who's there?
585    <S {Macb}.> A Friend.
586    <S {Banq}.> What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's #a bed.
587    He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
588    And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
589    This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
590    By the name of most kind Hostesse,
591    And shut vp in measurelesse content.
592    <S {Mac}.> Being vnprepar'd,
593    Our #will became the seruant to defect,
594    Which else should free haue wrought.
595    <S {Banq}.> All's well.
596    I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
597    To you they haue shew'd some truth.
598    <S {Macb}.> I thinke not of them:
599    Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
600    We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
601    If you would graunt the time.
602    <S {Banq}.> At your kind'st leysure.
603    <S {Macb}.> If you shall cleaue to my consent,
604    When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you.
605    <S {Banq}.> So I lose none,
606    In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
607    My Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,
608    I shall be counsail'd.
609    <S {Macb}.> Good repose the while.
610    <S {Banq}.> Thankes Sir: the like to you.  <D {Exit Banquo}.>
611   *<S {Macb}.> Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,
612    She strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.  <D {Exit}.>
613    Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
614   *The Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
615    I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.
616    Art thou not fatall Vision, sensible
617    To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but
618    A Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,
619    Proceeding from the heat- oppressed Braine?
620    I see thee yet, in forme as palpable,
621    As this which now I draw.
622    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
623    And such an Instrument I was to vse.
624    Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,
625    Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
626    And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
627    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
628    It is the bloody Businesse, which informes
629    Thus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World
630    Nature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse
631    The Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates
632    Pale {Heccats} Offrings: and wither'd Murther,
633    Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
634    Whose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
635    With {Tarquins} rauishing sides, towards his designe
636    Moues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme- set Earth
637    Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare
638    Thy very stones prate of my where- about,
639    And take the present horror from the time,
640    Which now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:
641    Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.
642    <D {A Bell rings}.>
643    I goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.
644    Heare it not, {Duncan}, for it is a Knell,
645    That summons thee to Heauen, or to #Hell.  <D {Exit}.>
646    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
647    <D {Enter Lady}.>
648   *<S {La}.> That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:
649    What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.
650    Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
651   *The fatall Bell- man, which giues the stern'st good- night.
652    He is about it, the Doores are open:
653    And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge
654    With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
655    That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
656    Whether they liue, or dye.
657    <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
658    <S {Macb}.> Who's there? what hoa?
659    <S {Lady}.> Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,
660    And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
661    Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
662    He could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled
663    My Father as he slept, I had don't.
664    My Husband?
665    <S {Macb}.> I haue done the deed:
666    Didst thou not heare a noyse?
667   *<S {Lady}.> I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
668    Did not you speake?
669    <S {Macb}.> When?
670    <S {Lady}.> Now.
671    <S {Macb}.> As I descended?
672    <S {Lady}.> #I.
673    <S {Macb}.> Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?
674    <S {Lady}.> {Donalbaine}.
675    <S {Mac}.> This is a sorry sight.
676    <S {Lady}.> A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
677    <S {Macb}.> There's one did laugh in's sleepe,
678    And one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:
679    I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
680    And addrest them againe to sleepe.
681    <S {Lady}.> There are two lodg'd together.
682   *<S {Macb}.> One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,
683    As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:
684    Listning their feare, I could not say Amen,
685    When they did say God blesse vs.
686    <S {Lady}.> Consider it not so deepely.
687    <S {Mac}.> But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
688   *I had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat.
689    <S {Lady}.> These deeds must not be thought
690    After these wayes: so, it will make vs mad.
691   *<S {Macb}.> Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:
692    {Macbeth} does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,
693    Sleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,
694    The death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,
695    Balme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,
696    Chiefe nourisher in Life's Feast.
697    <S {Lady}.> What doe you meane?
698   *<S {Macb}.> Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:
699    {Glamis} hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore {Cawdor}
700    Shall sleepe no more: {Macbeth} shall sleepe no more.
701   *<S {Lady}.> Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy {Thane},
702    You doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke
703    So braine- sickly of things: Goe get some Water,
      <P mm3>
704    And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
705    Why did you bring these Daggers from the place?
706    They must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare
707    The sleepie Groomes with blood.
708    <S {Macb}.> Ile goe no more:
709    I am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:
710    Looke on't againe, I dare not.
711    <S {Lady}.> Infirme of purpose:
712    Giue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,
713    Are but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Child-hood,
714    That feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,
715    Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,
716    For it must seeme their Guilt.  <D {Exit}.>
717    <D {Knocke within}.>
718    <S {Macb}.> Whence is that knocking?
719    How is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?
720    What Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.
721    Will all great {Neptunes} Ocean wash this blood
722    Cleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather
723    The multitudinous Seas incarnardine,
724    Making the Greene one, Red.
725    <D {Enter Lady}.>
726    <S {Lady}.> My Hands are of your colour: but I shame
727    To weare a Heart so white.  <D {Knocke}.>
728    I heare a knocking at the South entry:
729    Retyre we to our Chamber:
730    A little Water cleares vs of this deed.
731    How easie is it then? your Constancie
732    Hath left you vnattended.  <D {Knocke}.>
733    Hearke, more knocking.
734    Get on your Night- Gowne, least occasion call vs,
735    And shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost
736    So poorely in your thoughts.
737    <S {Macb}.> To know my deed,  <D {Knocke}.>
738    'Twere best not know my selfe.
739    Wake {Duncan} with thy knocking:
740    I would thou could'st.  <D {Exeunt}.>
741    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
742    <D {Enter a Porter}.
743    {Knocking within}.>
744   *<S {Porter}.> Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were
745   *Porter of #Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the
746   *Key. <D {Knock}.> Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there
747   *i'th' name of {Belzebub}? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd
748   *himselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue
749   *Napkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't. <D {Knock}.>
750   *Knock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?
751   *Faith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both
752   *the Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason
753   *enough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Hea-uen:
754   *oh come in, Equiuocator. <D {Knock}.> Knock,
755   *Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English
756   *Taylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:
757   *Come in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose. <D {Knock}.>
758   *Knock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this
759   *place is too cold for #Hell. Ile Deuill- Porter it no further:
760   *I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that
761   *goe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire. <D {Knock}.>
762    Anon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.
763    <D {Enter Macduff, and Lenox}.>
764    <S {Macd}.> Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,
765    That you doe lye so late?
766   *<S {Port}.> Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:
767    And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things.
768   *<S {Macd}.> What three things does Drinke especially
769    prouoke?
770   *<S {Port}.> Marry, Sir, Nose- painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
771   *Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
772   *the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
773   *much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Le-cherie:
774   *it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
775   *and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis- heartens
776   *him; makes him stand #too, and not stand #too: in conclu-sion,
777   *equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
778    leaues him.
779   *<S {Macd}.> I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night.
780   *<S {Port}.> That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I
781   *requited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong
782   *for him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I
783    made a Shift to cast him.
784    <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
785    <S {Macd}.> Is thy Master stirring?
786    Our knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes.
787    <S {Lenox}.> Good morrow, Noble Sir.
788    <S {Macb}.> Good morrow both.
789    <S {Macd}.> Is the King stirring, worthy {Thane}?
790    <S {Macb}.> Not yet.
791    <S {Macd}.> He did command me to call timely on him,
792    I haue almost slipt the houre.
793    <S {Macb}.> Ile bring you to him.
794    <S {Macd}.> I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:
795    But yet 'tis one.
796    <S {Macb}.> The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:
797    This is the Doore.
798   *<S {Macd}.> Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted
799    seruice.  <D {Exit Macduffe}.>
800    <S {Lenox}.> Goes the King hence to day?
801    <S {Macb}.> He does: he did appoint so.
802    <S {Lenox}.> The Night ha's been vnruly:
803    Where we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,
804    And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
805    Strange Schreemes of Death,
806    And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
807    Of dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,
808    New hatch'd toth' wofull time.
809    The obscure Bird clamor'd the liue- long Night.
810    Some say, the Earth was Feuorous,
811    And did shake.
812    <S {Macb}.> 'Twas a rough Night.
813    <S {Lenox}.> My young remembrance cannot paralell
814    A fellow to it.
815    <D {Enter Macduff}.>
816    <S {Macd}.> O horror, horror, horror,
817    Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee.
818    <S {Macb}. {and} {Lenox}.> What's the matter?
819    <S {Macd}.> Confusion now hath made his Master- peece:
820    Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope
821    The Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence
822    The Life o'th' Building.
823    <S {Macb}.> What is't you say, the Life?
824    <S {Lenox}.> Meane you his Maiestie?
825   *<S {Macd}.> Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight
826    With a new {Gorgon}. Doe not bid me speake:
      <P mm3v>
827    See, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,
828    <D {Exeunt Macbeth and Lenox}.>
829    Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
830    {#Banquo}, and {Donalbaine}: {Malcolme} awake,
831    Shake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,
832    And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
833    The great Doomes Image: {Malcolme}, {Banquo},
834    As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
835    To countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.
836    <D {Bell rings. Enter Lady}.>
837    <S {Lady}.> What's the Businesse?
838    That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
839    The sleepers of the House? speake, speake.
840    <S {Macd}.> O gentle Lady,
841    'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:
842    The repetition in a Womans eare,
843    Would murther as it fell.
844    <D {Enter Banquo}.>
845    O {Banquo}, {Banquo}, Our Royall Master's murther'd.
846    <S {Lady}.> Woe, alas:
847    What, in our House?
848    <S {Ban}.> Too cruell, any where.
849    Deare {Duff}, I prythee contradict thy selfe,
850    And say, it is not so.
851    <D {Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse}.>
852    <S {Macb}.> Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,
853    I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
854    There's nothing serious in Mortalitie:
855    All is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,
856    The Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees
857    Is left this Vault, to brag of.
858    <D {Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine}.>
859    <S {Donal}.> What is amisse?
860    <S {Macb}.> You are, and doe not know't:
861    The Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood
862    Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt.
863    <S {Macd}.> Your Royall Father's murther'd.
864    <S {Mal}.> Oh, by whom?
865   *<S {Lenox}.> Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:
866    Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,
867    So were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found
868    Vpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,
869    No mans Life was to be trusted with them.
870    <S {Macb}.> O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,
871    That I did kill them.
872    <S {Macd}.> Wherefore did you so?
873   *<S {Macb}.> Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,
874    Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
875    Th' expedition of my violent Loue
876    Out- run the pawser, Reason. Here lay {Duncan},
877    His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,
878    And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
879    For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,
880    Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers
881    Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,
882    That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
883    Courage, to make's loue knowne?
884    <S {Lady}.> Helpe me hence, hoa.
885    <S {Macd}.> Looke to the Lady.
886    <S {Mal}.> Why doe we hold our tongues,
887    That most may clayme this argument for ours?
888    <S {Donal}.> What should be spoken here,
889    Where our Fate hid in an augure hole,
890    May rush, and seize vs? Let's away,
891    Our Teares are not yet brew'd.
892    <S {Mal}.> Nor our strong Sorrow
893    Vpon the foot of Motion.
894    <S {Banq}.> Looke to the Lady:
895    And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
896    That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
897    And question this most bloody piece of worke,
898    To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
899    In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
900    Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
901    Of Treasonous Mallice.
902    <S {Macd}.> And so doe I.
903    <S {All}.> So all.
904    <S {Macb}.> Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
905    And meet i'th' Hall together.
906    <S {All}.> Well contented.  <D {Exeunt}.>
907    <S {Malc}.> What will you doe?
908    Let's not consort with them:
909    To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
910    Which the false man do's easie.
911    Ile to England.
912    <S {Don}.> To Ireland, I:
913    Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
914    Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
915    The neere in blood, the neerer bloody.
916    <S {Malc}.> This murtherous Shaft that's shot,
917    Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
918    Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
919    And let vs not be daintie of leaue- taking,
920    But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,
921    Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
922    <D {Exeunt}.>
923    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
924    <D {Enter Rosse, with an Old man}.>
925    <S {Old} {man}.> Threescore and ten I can remember well,
926    Within the Volume of which Time, I haue seene
927   *Houres dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night
928    Hath trifled former knowings.
929    <S {Rosse}.> Ha, good  Father,
930    Thou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,
931    Threatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,
932    And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
933    Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
934    That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,
935    When liuing Light should kisse it?
936    <S {Old} {man}.> 'Tis vnnaturall,
937    Euen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,
938    A Faulcon towring in her pride of place,
939    Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd.
940    <S {Rosse}.> And {Duncans} Horses,
941    (A thing most strange, and certaine)
942    Beauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,
943    Turn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,
944    Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would
945    Make Warre with Mankinde.
946    <S {Old} {man}.> 'Tis said, they eate each other.
947    <S {Rosse}.> They did so:
      <P mm4><C B>
948    To th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.
949    <D {Enter Macduffe}.>
950    Heere comes the good {Macduffe}.
951    How goes the world Sir, now?
952    <S {Macd}.> Why see you not?
953   *<S {Ross}.> Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?
954    <S {Macd}.> Those that {Macbeth} hath slaine.
955    <S {Ross}.> Alas the day,
956    What good could they pretend?
957    <S {Macd}.> They were subborned,
958    {Malcolme}, and {Donalbaine} the Kings two Sonnes
959    Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
960    Suspition of the deed.
961    <S {Rosse}.> 'Gainst Nature still,
962    Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp
963    Thine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,
964    The Soueraignty will fall vpon {Macbeth}.
965    <S {Macd}.> He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
966    To be inuested.
967    <S {Rosse}.> Where is {Duncans} body?
968    <S {Macd}.> Carried to Colmekill,
969    The Sacred Store- house of his Predecessors,
970    And Guardian of their Bones.
971    <S {Rosse}.> Will you to Scone?
972    <S {Macd}.> No Cosin, Ile to Fife.
973    <S {Rosse}.> Well, I will thither.
974   *<S {Macd}.> Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu
975    Least our old Robes sit easier then our new.
976    <S {Rosse}.> Farewell, Father.
977    <S {Old} {M}.> Gods benyson go with you, and with those
978    That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
979    <D {Exeunt omnes}>
980    <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
981    <D {Enter Banquo}.>
982    <S {Banq}.> Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
983    As the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare
984    Thou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide
985    It should not stand in thy Posterity,
986    But that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father
987    Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
988    As vpon thee {Macbeth}, their Speeches shine,
989    Why by the verities on thee made good,
990    May they not be my Oracles as well,
991    And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
992    <D {Senit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox},
993    {Rosse, Lords, and Attendants}.>
994    <S {Macb}.> Heere's our chiefe Guest.
995    <S {La}.> If he had beene forgotten,
996    It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
997    And all- thing vnbecomming.
998    <S {Macb}.> To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,
999    And Ile request your presence.
1000   <S {Banq}.> Let your Highnesse
1001   Command vpon me, to the which my duties
1002   Are with a most indissoluble tye
1003   For euer knit.
1004   <S {Macb}.> Ride you this afternoone?
1005   <S {Ban}.> #I, my good Lord.
1006  *<S {Macb}.> We should haue else desir'd your good aduice
      <C A>
1007   (Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)
1008   In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
1009   Is't farre you ride?
1010   <S {Ban}.> As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time
1011   'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,
1012   I must become a borrower of the Night,
1013   For a darke houre, or twaine.
1014   <S {Macb}.> Faile not our Feast.
1015   <S {Ban}.> My Lord, I will not.
1016   <S {Macb}.> We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd
1017   In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
1018   Their cruell Parricide, filling their hearers
1019   With strange inuention. But of that to morrow,
1020   When therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,
1021   Crauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:
1022   Adieu, till you returne at Night.
1023   Goes {Fleance} with you?
1024   <S {Ban}.> #I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's.
1025   <S {Macb}.> I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:
1026   And so I doe commend you to their backs.
1027   Farwell.  <D {Exit Banquo}.>
1028   Let euery man be master of his time,
1029   Till seuen at Night, to make societie
1030   The sweeter welcome:
1031   We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:
1032   While then, God be with you.  <D {Exeunt Lords}.>
1033   Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
1034   Our pleasure?
1035  *<S {Seruant}.> They are, my Lord, without the Pallace
1036   Gate.
1037   <S {Macb}.> Bring them before vs.  <D {Exit Seruant}.>
1038   To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus
1039   Our feares in {Banquo} sticke deepe,
1040   And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
1041   Which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
1042   And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
1043   He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,
1044   To act in safetie. There is none but he,
1045   Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,
1046   My {Genius} is rebuk'd, as it is said
1047   {Mark Anthonies} was by {Caesar}. He chid the Sisters,
1048   When first they put the Name of King vpon me,
1049   And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet- like,
1050   They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.
1051   Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,
1052   And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
1053   Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
1054   No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,
1055   For {Banquo's} Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,
1056   For them, the gracious {Duncan} haue I murther'd,
1057   Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace
1058   Onely for them, and mine eternall Iewell
1059   Giuen to the common Enemie of Man,
1060   To make them Kings, the Seedes of {Banquo} Kings.
1061   Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,
1062   And champion me to th' vtterance.
1063   Who's there?
1064   <D {Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers}.>
1065   Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.
1066   <D {Exit Seruant}.>
1067   Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
1068   <S {Murth}.> It was, so please your Highnesse.
1069   <S {Macb}.> Well then,
1070   Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:
      <P mm4v>
1071   Know, that it was he, in the times past,
1072   Which held you so vnder fortune,
1073   Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.
1074   This I made good to you, in our last conference,
1075   Past in probation with you:
1076   How you were borne in hand, how crost:
1077   The Instruments: who wrought with them:
1078   And all things else, that might
1079   To halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,
1080   Say, Thus did {Banquo}.
1081   <S 1.{Murth}.> You made it knowne to vs.
1082   <S {Macb}.> I did so:
1083   And went further, which is now
1084   Our point of second meeting.
1085   Doe you finde your patience so predominant,
1086   In your nature, that you can let this goe?
1087   Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
1088   And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
1089   Hath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd
1090   Yours for euer?
1091   <S 1.{Murth}.> We are men, my Liege.
1092   <S {Macb}.> #I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,
1093  *As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
1094   Showghes, Water- Rugs, and Demy- Wolues are clipt
1095   All by the Name of Dogges: the valued file
1096   Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
1097   The House- keeper, the Hunter, euery one
1098   According to the gift, which bounteous Nature
1099   Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
1100   Particular addition, from the Bill,
1101   That writes them all alike: and so of men.
1102   Now, if you haue a station in the file,
1103   Not i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,
1104   And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
1105   Whose execution takes your Enemie off,
1106   Grapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,
1107   Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life,
1108   Which in his Death were perfect.
1109   <S 2.{Murth}.> I am one, my Liege,
1110   Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World
1111   Hath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,
1112   To spight the World.
1113   <S 1.{Murth}.> And I another,
1114   So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,
1115   That I would set my Life on any Chance,
1116   To mend it, or be rid on't.
1117  *<S {Macb}.> Both of you know {Banquo} was your Enemie.
1118   <S {Murth}.> True, my Lord.
1119   <S {Macb}.> So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,
1120   That euery minute of his being, thrusts
1121   Against my neer'st of Life: and though I could
1122   With bare- fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,
1123   And bid my #will auouch it; yet I must not,
1124   For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,
1125   Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
1126   Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,
1127   That I to your assistance doe make loue,
1128   Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,
1129   For sundry weightie Reasons.
1130   <S 2.{Murth}.> We shall, my Lord,
1131   Performe what you command vs.
1132   <S 1.{Murth}.> Though our Liues===
1133   <S {Macb}.> Your Spirits shine through you.
1134   Within this houre, at most,
1135   I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
1136   Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
1137   The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,
1138   And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
1139   That I require a clearenesse; and with him,
1140   To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:
1141   <S {Fleans}>, his Sonne, that keepes him companie,
1142   Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,
1143   Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fate
1144   Of that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,
1145   Ile come to you anon.
1146   <S {Murth}.> We are resolu'd, my Lord.
1147   <S {Macb}.> Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,
1148   It is concluded: {Banquo}, thy Soules flight,
1149   If it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1150   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1151   <D {Enter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant}.>
1152   <S {Lady}.> Is {Banquo} gone from Court?
1153   <S {Seruant}.> #I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night.
1154   <S {Lady}.> Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,
1155   For a few words.
1156   <S {Seruant}.> Madame, I will.  <D {Exit}.>
1157   <S {Lady}.> Nought's had, all's spent.
1158   Where our desire is got without content:
1159   'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
1160   Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
1161   <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
1162   How now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?
1163   Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making,
1164   Vsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd
1165   With them they thinke on: things without all remedie
1166   Should be without regard: what's done, is done.
1167   <S {Macb}.> We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:
1168   Shee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice
1169   Remaines in danger of her former Tooth.
1170   But let the frame of things dis- ioynt,
1171   Both the Worlds suffer,
1172   Ere we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe
1173   In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
1174   That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
1175   Whom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,
1176   Then on the torture of the Minde to lye
1177   In restlesse extasie.
1178   {Duncane} is in his Graue:
1179   After Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,
1180   Treason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,
1181   Mallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,
1182   Can touch him further.
1183   <S {Lady}.> Come on:
1184   Gentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,
1185   Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night.
1186   <S {Macb}.> So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:
1187   Let your remembrance apply to {Banquo},
1188   Present him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:
1189   Vnsafe the while, that wee must laue
1190   Our Honors in these flattering streames,
1191   And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
1192   Disguising what they are.
1193   <S {Lady}.> You must leaue this.
1194   <S {Macb}.> O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:
1195   Thou know'st, that {Banquo} and his {Fleans} liues.
      <P mm5>
1196   <S {Lady}.> But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne.
1197   <S {Macb}.> There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,
1198   Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne
1199   His Cloyster'd flight, ere to black {Heccats} summons
1200   The shard- borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,
1201   Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
1202   There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note.
1203   <S {Lady}.> What's to be done?
1204  *<S {Macb}.> Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,
1205   Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,
1206   Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,
1207   And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
1208   Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,
1209   Which keepes me pale. Light thickens,
1210   And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
1211   Good things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,
1212   Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.
1213   Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
1214   Things bad begun, make strong themselues by #ill:
1215   So prythee goe with me.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1216   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
1217   <D {Enter three Murtherers}.>
1218   <S 1.> But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?
1219   <S 3.> {Macbeth}.
1220   <S 2.> He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers
1221   Our Offices, and what we haue to doe,
1222   To the direction iust.
1223   <S 1.> Then stand with vs:
1224   The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.
1225   Now spurres the lated Traueller apace,
1226   To gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches
1227   The subiect of our Watch.
1228   <S 3.> Hearke, I heare Horses.
1229   <S {Banquo} {within}.> Giue vs a Light there, hoa.
1230   <S 2.> Then 'tis hee:
1231   The rest, that are within the note of expectation,
1232   Alreadie are i'th' Court.
1233   <S 1.> His Horses goe about.
1234   <S 3.> Almost a mile: but he does vsually,
1235   So all men doe, from hence toth' Pallace Gate
1236   Make it their Walke.
1237   <D {Enter Banquo and Fleans, with a Torch}.>
1238   <S 2.> A Light, a Light.
1239   <S 3.> 'Tis hee.
1240   <S 1.> Stand too't.
1241   <S {Ban}.> It will be Rayne to Night.
1242   <S 1.> Let it come downe.
1243   <S {Ban}.> O, Trecherie!
1244   Flye good {Fleans}, flye, flye, flye,
1245   Thou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!
1246   <S 3.> Who did strike out the Light?
1247   <S 1.> #Was't not the way?
1248   <S 3.> There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled.
1249   <S 2.> We haue lost
1250   Best halfe of our Affaire.
1251   <S 1.> Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
1252   <D {Exeunt}.>
      <C B>
1253   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>
1254   <D {Banquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox},
1255   {Lords, and Attendants}.>
1256   <S {Macb}.> You know your owne degrees, sit downe:
1257   At first and last, the hearty welcome.
1258   <S {Lords}.> Thankes to your Maiesty.
1259   <S {Macb}.> Our selfe will mingle with Society,
1260   And play the humble Host:
1261   Our Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time
1262   We will require her welcome.
1263   <S {La}.> Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,
1264   For my heart speakes, they are welcome.
1265   <D {Enter first Murtherer}.>
1266  *<S {Macb}.> See they encounter thee with their harts thanks
1267   Both sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,
1268   Be large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure
1269   The Table round. There's blood vpon thy face.
1270   <S {Mur}.> 'Tis {Banquo's} then.
1271   <S {Macb}.> 'Tis better thee without, then he within.
1272   Is he dispatch'd?
1273   <S {Mur}.> My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him.
1274   <S {Mac}.> Thou art the best o'th' Cut- throats,
1275   Yet hee's good that did the like for {Fleans}:
1276   If thou did'st it, thou art the Non- pareill.
1277   <S {Mur}.> Most Royall Sir
1278   {Fleans} is scap'd.
1279   <S {Macb}.> Then comes my Fit againe:
1280   I had else beene perfect;
1281   Whole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,
1282   As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
1283   But now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in
1284   To sawcy doubts, and feares. But {Banquo}'s safe?
1285   <S {Mur}.> #I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
1286   With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
1287   The least a Death to Nature.
1288   <S {Macb}.> Thankes for that:
1289   There the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled
1290   Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed,
1291   No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow
1292   Wee'l heare our selues againe.  <D {Exit Murderer}.>
1293   <S {Lady}.> My Royall Lord,
1294   You do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold
1295   That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis #a making:
1296   'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:
1297   From thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,
1298   Meeting were bare without it.
1299   <D {Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place}.>
1300   <S {Macb}.> Sweet Remembrancer:
1301   Now good digestion waite on Appetite,
1302   And health on both.
1303   <S {Lenox}.> May't please your Highnesse sit.
1304  *<S {Macb}.> Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,
1305   Were the grac'd person of our {Banquo} present:
1306   Who, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,
1307   Then pitty for Mischance.
1308   <S {Rosse}.> His absence (Sir)
1309   Layes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse
1310   To grace vs with your Royall Company?
      <P mm5v>
1311   <S {Macb}.> The Table's full.
1312   <S {Lenox}.> Heere is a place reseru'd Sir.
1313   <S {Macb}.> Where?
1314   <S {Lenox}.> Heere my good Lord.
1315   What is't that moues your Highnesse?
1316   <S {Macb}.> Which of you haue done this?
1317   <S {Lords}.> What, my good Lord?
1318   <S {Macb}.> Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake
1319   Thy goary lockes at me.
1320   <S {Rosse}.> Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well.
1321   <S {Lady}.> Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,
1322   And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
1323   The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
1324   He will againe be well. If much you note him
1325   You shall offend him, and extend his Passion,
1326   Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
1327   <S {Macb}.> #I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that
1328   Which might appall the Diuell.
1329   <S {La}.> O proper stuffe:
1330   This is the very painting of your feare:
1331   This is the Ayre- drawne- Dagger which you said
1332   Led you to {Duncan}. O, these flawes and starts
1333   (Impostors to true feare) would well become
1334   A womans story, at a Winters fire
1335   Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,
1336   Why do you make such faces? When all's done
1337   You looke but on a stoole.
1338   <S {Macb}.> Prythee see there:
1339   Behold, looke, loe, how say you:
1340   Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.
1341   If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send
1342   Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments
1343   Shall be the Mawes of Kytes.
1344   <S {La}.> What? quite vnmann'd in folly.
1345   <S {Macb}.> If I stand heere, I saw him.
1346   <S {La}.> Fie for shame.
1347  *<S {Macb}.> Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time
1348   Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:
1349   #I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd
1350   Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene,
1351   That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
1352   And there an end: But now they rise againe
1353   With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,
1354   And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
1355   Then such a murther is.
1356   <S {La}.> My worthy Lord
1357   Your Noble Friends do lacke you.
1358   <S {Macb}.> I do forget:
1359   Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends,
1360   I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
1361   To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,
1362   Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:
1363   <D {Enter Ghost}.>
1364   I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
1365   And to our deere Friend {Banquo}, whom we misse:
1366   Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,
1367   And all to all.
1368   <S {Lords}.> Our duties, and the pledge.
1369  *<S {Mac}.> Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:
1370   Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:
1371   Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
1372   Which thou dost glare with.
1373   <S {La}.> Thinke of this good Peeres
1374   But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,
1375   Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time.
1376   <S {Macb}.> What man dare, I dare:
1377   Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,
1378   The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,
1379   Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues
1380   Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
1381   And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
1382   If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee
1383   The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,
1384   Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone
1385   I am a man againe: pray you sit still.
1386   <S {La}.> You haue displac'd the mirth,
1387   Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder.
1388   <S {Macb}.> Can such things be,
1389   And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
1390   Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange
1391   Euen to the disposition that I owe,
1392   When now I thinke you can behold such sights,
1393   And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
1394   When mine is blanch'd with feare.
1395   <S {Rosse}.> What sights, my Lord?
1396  *<S {La}.> I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse
1397   Question enrages him: at once, goodnight.
1398   Stand not vpon the order of your going,
1399   But go at once.
1400   <S {Len}.> Good night, and better health
1401   Attend his Maiesty.
1402   <S {La}.> A kinde goodnight to all.  <D {Exit Lords}.>
1403   <S {Macb}.> It will haue blood they say:
1404   Blood will haue Blood:
1405  *Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:
1406   Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue
1407  *By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
1408   The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
1409   <S {La}.> Almost at oddes with morning, which is which.
1410  *<S {Macb}.> How say'st thou that {Macduff} denies his person
1411   At our great bidding.
1412   <S {La}.> Did you send to him Sir?
1413   <S {Macb}.> I heare it by the way: But I will send:
1414   There's not a one of them but in his house
1415   I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
1416   (And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.
1417   More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know
1418   By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,
1419   All causes shall giue way. I am in blood
1420   Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more,
1421   Returning were as tedious as go ore:
1422   Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
1423   Which must be acted, ere they may be scand.
1424   <S {La}.> You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe.
1425  *<S {Macb}.> Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self- abuse
1426   Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
1427   We are yet but yong indeed.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A A>
1428   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
1429   <D {Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting}
1430   {Hecat}.>
1431   <S 1.> Why how now {Hecat}, you looke angerly?
1432   <S {Hec}.> Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?
1433   Sawcy, and ouer- bold, how did you dare
1434   To Trade, and Trafficke with {Macbeth},
1435   In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
      <P mm6>
1436   And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
1437   The close contriuer of all harmes,
1438   Was neuer call'd to beare my part,
1439   Or shew the glory of our #Art?
1440   And which is worse, all you haue done
1441   Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
1442   Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)
1443   Loues for his owne ends, not for you.
1444   But make amends now: Get you gon,
1445   And at the pit of Acheron
1446   Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he
1447   Will come, to know his Destinie.
1448   Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide,
1449   Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
1450   I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
1451   Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.
1452   Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone.
1453   Vpon the Corner of the Moone
1454   There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,
1455   Ile catch it ere it come to ground;
1456   And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
1457   Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights,
1458   As by the strength of their illusion,
1459   Shall draw him on to his Confusion.
1460   He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
1461   His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:
1462   And you all know, Security
1463   Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
1464   <D {Musicke, and a Song}.>
1465   Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see
1466   Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.
1467   <D {Sing within. Come away, come away, &c}.>
1468   <S 1> Come, let's make #hast, shee'l soone be
1469   Backe againe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
      <A S>
1470   <Z {Scaena Sexta}.>
1471   <D {Enter Lenox, and another Lord}.>
1472   <S {Lenox}.> My former Speeches,
1473   Haue but hit your Thoughts
1474   Which can interpret farther: Onely I say
1475  *Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious {Duncan}
1476   Was pittied of {Macbeth}: marry he was dead:
1477   And the right valiant {Banquo} walk'd too late,
1478   Whom you may say (if't please you) {Fleans} kill'd,
1479   For {Fleans} fled: Men must not walke too late.
1480   Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
1481   It was for {Malcolme}, and for {Donalbane}
1482   To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
1483   How it did greeue {Macbeth}? Did he not straight
1484   In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
1485   That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
1486   Was not that Nobly done? #I, and wisely too:
1487   For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
1488   To heare the men deny't. So that I say,
1489   He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,
1490   That had he {Duncans} Sonnes vnder his Key,
1491   (As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde
1492   What 'twere to kill a Father: So should {Fleans}.
1493   But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd
1494   His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare
1495   {Macduffe} liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
1496   Where he bestowes himselfe?
1497   <S {Lord}.> The Sonnes of {Duncane}
1498   (From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
1499   Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd
1500   Of the most Pious {Edward}, with such grace,
1501   That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing
1502   Takes from his high respect. Thither {Macduffe}
1503   Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
1504   To wake Northumberland, and warlike {Seyward},
1505   That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)
1506   To ratifie the Worke) we may againe
1507   Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:
1508   Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;
1509   Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,
1510   All which we pine for now. And this report
1511   Hath so exasperate their King, that hee
1512   Prepares for some attempt of Warre.
1513   <S {Len}.> Sent he to {Macduffe}?
1514   <S {Lord}.> He did: and with an absolute #Sir, not I
1515   The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
1516   And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
1517   That clogges me with this Answer.
1518   <S {Lenox}.> And that well might
1519   Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance
1520   His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell
1521   Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold
1522   His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing
1523   May soone returne to this our suffering Country,
1524   Vnder a hand accurs'd.
1525   <S {Lord}.> Ile send my Prayers with him.  <D {Exeunt}>
1526   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
1527   <D {Thunder. Enter the three Witches}.>
1528   <S 1> Thrice the brinded Cat hath mew'd.
1529   <S 2> Thrice, and once the Hedge- Pigge whin'd.
1530   <S 3> Harpier cries, 'tis time, 'tis time.
1531   <S 1> Round about the Caldron go:
1532   In the poysond Entrailes throw
1533   Toad, that vnder cold stone,
1534   Dayes and Nights, ha's thirty one:
1535   Sweltred Venom sleeping got,
1536   Boyle thou first i'th' charmed pot.
1537   <S {All}.> Double, double, toile and trouble;
1538   Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble.
1539   <S 2> Fillet of a Fenny Snake,
1540   In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
1541   Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,
1542   Wooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:
1543   Adders Forke, and Blinde- wormes Sting,
1544   Lizards legge, and Howlets wing:
1545   For a Charme of powrefull trouble,
1546   Like a Hell- broth, boyle and bubble.
1547   <S {All}.> Double, double, toyle and trouble,
1548   Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble.
1549   <S 3> Scale of Dragon, Tooth of Wolfe,
1550   Witches Mummey, Maw, and Gulfe
1551   Of the rauin'd salt Sea sharke:
1552   Roote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:
1553   Liuer of Blaspheming Iew,
1554   Gall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,
1555   Sliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:
      <P mm6v>
1556   Nose of Turke, and Tartars lips:
1557   Finger of Birth- strangled Babe,
1558   Ditch- deliuer'd by a Drab,
1559   Make the Grewell thicke, and slab.
1560   Adde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,
1561   For th' Ingredience of our Cawdron.
1562   <S {All}.> Double, double, toyle and trouble,
1563   Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble.
1564   <S 2> Coole it with a Baboones blood,
1565   Then the Charme is firme and good.
      <A A>
1566   <D {Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches}.>
1567   <S {Hec}.> O well done: I commend your paines,
1568   And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
1569   And now about the Cauldron sing
1570   Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring,
1571   Inchanting all that you put in.
1572   <D {Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c}.>
      <A S>
1573   <S 2> By the pricking of my Thumbes,
1574   Something wicked this way comes:
1575   Open Lockes, who euer knockes.
1576   <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
1577  *<S {Macb}.> How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?
1578   What is't you do?
1579   <S {All}.> A deed without a name.
1580   <S {Macb}.> I coniure you, by that which you Professe,
1581   (How ere you come to know it) answer me:
1582   Though you vntye the Windes, and let them fight
1583   Against the Churches: Though the yesty Waues
1584   Confound and swallow Nauigation vp:
1585  *Though bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,
1586   Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
1587   Though Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope
1588  *Their heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure
1589   Of Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,
1590   Euen till destruction sicken: Answer me
1591   To what I aske you.
1592   <S 1> Speake.
1593   <S 2> Demand.
1594   <S 3> Wee'l answer.
1595   <S 1> Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,
1596   Or from our Masters.
1597   <S {Macb}.> Call 'em: let me see 'em.
1598   <S 1> Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten
1599   Her nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten
1600   From the Murderers Gibbet, throw
1601   Into the Flame.
1602   <S {All}.> Come high or low:
1603   Thy Selfe and Office deaftly show.  <D {Thunder}.
1604   1. {Apparation, an Armed Head}.>
1605   <S {Macb}.> Tell me, thou vnknowne power.
1606   <S 1> He knowes thy thought:
1607   Heare his speech, but say thou nought.
1608   <S 1 {Appar}.> {Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth}:
1609   Beware {Macduffe},
1610   Beware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.
1611   <D {He Descends}.>
1612  *<S {Macb}.> What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks
1613  *Thou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more.
1614   <S 1> He will not be commanded: heere's another
1615   More potent then the first.  <D {Thunder}.
1616   2 {Apparition, a Bloody Childe}.>
1617   <S 2 {Appar}.> {Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth}.
1618   <S {Macb}.> Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee.
1619   <S {Appar}.> Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
1620   Laugh to scorne
1621   The powre of man: For none of woman borne
1622   Shall harme {Macbeth}.  <D {Descends}.>
1623  *<S {Mac}.> Then liue {Macduffe}: what need I feare of thee?
1624   But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
1625   And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
1626   That I may tell pale- hearted Feare, it lies;
1627   And sleepe in spight of Thunder.  <D {Thunder}
1628   3 {Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand}.>
1629   What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
1630   And weares vpon his Baby- brow, the round
1631   And top of Soueraignty?
1632   <S {All}.> Listen, but speake not too't.
1633   <S 3 {Appar}.> Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:
1634   Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:
1635   {Macbeth} shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
1636   Great Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill
1637   Shall come against him.  <D {Descend}.>
1638   <S {Macb}.> That will neuer bee:
1639   Who can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree
1640  *Vnfixe his earth- bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:
1641   Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
1642   Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd {Macbeth}
1643   Shall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath
1644   To time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart
1645   Throbs to know one thing: Tell me, if your #Art
1646   Can tell so much: Shall {Banquo's} issue euer
1647   Reigne in this Kingdome?
1648   <S {All}.> Seeke to know no more.
1649   <S {Macb}.> I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
1650   And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
1651  *Why sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?  <D {Hoboyes}>
1652   <S 1> Shew.
1653   <S 2> Shew.
1654   <S 3> Shew.
1655   <S {All}.> Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,
1656   Come like shadowes, so depart.
1657   <D {A shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse}
1658   {in his hand}.>
1659  *<S {Macb}.> Thou art too like the Spirit of {Banquo}: Down:
1660   Thy Crowne do's seare mine Eye- bals. And thy haire
1661   Thou other Gold- bound- brow, is like the first:
1662   A third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,
1663   Why do you shew me this? === A fourth? Start eyes!
1664   What will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?
1665   Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
1666   And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
1667   Which shewes me many more: and some I see,
1668   That two- fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
1669   Horrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,
1670   For the Blood- bolter'd {Banquo} smiles vpon me,
1671   And points at them for his. What? is this so?
      <A A>
1672   <S 1> #I Sir, all this is so. But why
1673   Stands {Macbeth} thus amazedly?
1674   Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
1675   And shew the best of our delights.
1676   Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,
1677   While you performe your Antique round:
1678   That this great King may kindly say,
1679   Our duties, did his welcome pay.  <D {Musicke}.
1680   {The Witches Dance, and vanish}.>
      <A S>
1681   <S {Macb}.> Where are they? Gone?
1682   Let this pernitious houre,
1683   Stand aye accursed in the Kalender.
1684   Come in, without there.  <D {Enter Lenox}.>
1685   <S {Lenox}.> What's your Graces #will.
      <P nn1>
1686   <S {Macb}.> Saw you the Weyard Sisters?
1687   <S {Lenox}.> No my Lord.
1688   <S {Macb}.> Came they not by you?
1689   <S {Lenox}.> No indeed my Lord.
1690   <S {Macb}.> Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,
1691   And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
1692   The gallopping of Horse. Who #was't came by?
1693  *<S {Len}.> 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:
1694   {Macduff} is fled to England.
1695   <S {Macb}.> Fled to England?
1696   <S {Len}.> #I, my good Lord.
1697   <S {Macb}.> Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
1698   The flighty purpose neuer is o're- tooke
1699   Vnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,
1700   The very firstlings of my heart shall be
1701   The firstlings of my hand. And euen now
1702  *To Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:
1703   The Castle of {Macduff}, I will surprize.
1704   Seize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword
1705   His Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules
1706   That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
1707   This deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,
1708   But no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?
1709   Come bring me where they are.  <D {Exeunt}>
1710   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1711   <D {Enter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse}.>
1712  *<S {Wife}.> What had he done, to make him fly the Land?
1713   <S {Rosse}.> You must haue patience Madam.
1714   <S {Wife}.> He had none:
1715   His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,
1716   Our feares do make vs Traitors.
1717   <S {Rosse}.> You know not
1718   Whether it was his wisedome, or his feare.
1719  *<S {Wife}.> Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,
1720   His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place
1721   From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,
1722   He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
1723   (The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
1724   Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:
1725   All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;
1726   As little is the Wisedome, where the flight
1727   So runnes against all reason.
1728   <S {Rosse}.> My deerest Cooz,
1729   I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
1730   He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
1731   The fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,
1732   But cruell are the times, when we are Traitors
1733   And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
1734   From what we feare, yet know not what we feare,
1735   But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea
1736   Each way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:
1737   Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:
1738   Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,
1739   To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,
1740   Blessing vpon you.
1741   <S {Wife}.> Father'd he is,
1742   And yet hee's Father- lesse.
1743   <S {Rosse}.> I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer
1744   It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
1745   I take my leaue at once.  <D {Exit Rosse}.>
1746   <S {Wife}.> Sirra, your Fathers dead,
1747   And what will you do now? How will you liue?
1748   <S {Son}.> As Birds do Mother.
1749   <S {Wife}.> What with Wormes, and Flyes?
1750   <S {Son}.> With what I get I meane, and so do they.
1751   <S {Wife}.> Poore Bird,
1752   Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,
1753   The Pitfall, nor the Gin.
1754   <S {Son}.> Why should I Mother?
1755   Poore Birds they are not set for:
1756   My Father is not dead for all your saying.
1757   <S {Wife}.> Yes, he is dead:
1758   How wilt thou do for a Father?
1759   <S {Son}.> Nay how will you do for a Husband?
1760   <S {Wife}.> Why I can buy me twenty at any Market.
1761   <S {Son}.> Then you'l #by 'em to sell againe.
1762   <S {Wife}.> Thou speak'st #with#all thy wit,
1763   And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee.
1764   <S {Son}.> Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
1765   <S {Wife}.> #I, that he was.
1766   <S {Son}.> What is a Traitor?
1767   <S {Wife}.> Why one that sweares, and lyes.
1768   <S {Son}.> And be all Traitors, that do so.
1769   <S {Wife}.> Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,
1770   And must be hang'd.
1771  *<S {Son}.> And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?
1772   <S {Wife}.> Euery one.
1773   <S {Son}.> Who must hang them?
1774   <S {Wife}.> Why, the honest men.
1775  *<S {Son}.> Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there
1776  *are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,
1777   and hang vp them.
1778   <S {Wife}.> Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:
1779   But how wilt thou do for a Father?
1780  *<S {Son}.> If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you
1781  *would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely
1782   haue a new Father.
1783   <S {Wife}.> Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?
1784   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1785  *<S {Mes}.> Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,
1786   Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;
1787   I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
1788   If you will take a homely mans aduice,
1789   Be not found heere: Hence with your little ones
1790   To fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:
1791   To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,
1792   Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,
1793   I dare abide no longer.  <D {Exit Messenger}>
1794   <S {Wife}.> Whether should I flye?
1795   I haue done no harme. But I remember now
1796   I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
1797   Is often laudable, to do good sometime
1798   Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)
1799   Do I put vp that womanly defence,
1800   To say I haue done no harme?
1801   What are these faces?
1802   <D {Enter Murtherers}.>
1803   <S {Mur}.> Where is your Husband?
1804   <S {Wife}.> I hope in no place so vnsanctified,
1805   Where such as thou may'st finde him.
1806   <S {Mur}.> He's a Traitor.
1807   <S {Son}.> Thou ly'st thou shagge- ear'd Villaine.
1808   <S {Mur}.> What you Egge?
1809   Yong fry of Treachery?
1810   <S {Son}.> He ha's kill'd me Mother,
1811   Run away I pray you.  <D {Exit crying Murther}.>
      <P nn1v>
1812   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1813   <D {Enter Malcolme and Macduffe}.>
1814  *<S {Mal}.> Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there
1815   Weepe our sad bosomes empty.
1816   <S {Macd}.> Let vs rather
1817   Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,
1818   Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,
1819  *New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes
1820   Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds
1821   As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out
1822   Like Syllable of Dolour.
1823   <S {Mal}.> What I beleeue, Ile waile;
1824   What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,
1825   As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
1826   What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.
1827   This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
1828   Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,
1829  *He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something
1830   You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome
1831   To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe
1832   T' appease an angry God.
1833   <S {Macd}.> I am not treacherous.
1834   <S {Malc}.> But {Macbeth} is.
1835   A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle
1836   In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
1837   That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
1838   Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
1839  *Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace
1840   Yet Grace must still looke so.
1841   <S {Macd}.> I haue lost my Hopes.
1842   <S {Malc}.> Perchance euen there
1843   Where I did finde my doubts.
1844   Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?
1845   Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,
1846   Without leaue- taking. I pray you,
1847   Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,
1848   But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,
1849   What euer I shall thinke.
1850   <S {Macd}.> Bleed, bleed poore Country,
1851   Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,
1852  *For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,
1853   The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
1854   I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,
1855   For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,
1856   And the rich East to boot.
1857   <S {Mal}.> Be not offended:
1858   I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
1859   I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
1860   It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
1861   Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,
1862   There would be hands vplifted in my right:
1863   And heere from gracious England haue I offer
1864   Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
1865   When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,
1866   Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country
1867   Shall haue more vices then it had before,
1868   More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,
1869   By him that shall succeede.
1870   <S {Macd}.> What should he be?
1871   <S {Mal}.> It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know
1872   All the particulars of Vice so grafted,
1873   That when they shall be open'd, blacke {Macbeth}
1874   Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State
1875   Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd
1876   With my confinelesse harmes.
1877   <S {Macd}.> Not in the Legions
1878   Of horrid #Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd
1879   In euils, to top {Macbeth}.
1880   <S {Mal}.> I grant him Bloody,
1881   Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,
1882   Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne
1883   That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
1884   In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
1885   Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
1886   The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire
1887   All continent Impediments would ore- beare
1888   That did oppose my #will. Better {Macbeth},
1889   Then such an one to reigne.
1890   <S {Macd}.> Boundlesse intemperance
1891   In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
1892   Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,
1893   And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
1894   To take vpon you what is yours: you may
1895   Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
1896  *And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
1897   We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be
1898   That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many
1899   As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,
1900   Finding it so inclinde.
1901   <S {Mal}.> With this, there growes
1902   In my most ill- composd Affection, such
1903   A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,
1904   I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
1905   Desire his Iewels, and this others House,
1906   And my more- hauing, would be as a Sawce
1907   To make me hunger more, that I should forge
1908   Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,
1909   Destroying them for wealth.
1910   <S {Macd}.> This Auarice
1911   stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote
1912   Then Summer- seeming Lust: and it hath bin
1913   The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,
1914   Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your #will
1915   Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,
1916   With other Graces weigh'd.
1917  *<S {Mal}.> But I haue none. The King- becoming Graces,
1918   As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
1919   Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,
1920   Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,
1921   I haue no rellish of them, but abound
1922   In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
1923   Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should
1924   Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into #Hell,
1925   Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound
1926   All vnity on earth.
1927   <S {Macd}.> O Scotland, Scotland.
1928   <S {Mal}.> If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:
1929   I am as I haue spoken.
1930  *<S {Mac}.> Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!
1931   With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
1932   When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?
1933   Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne
1934   By his owne Interdiction stands accust,
1935   And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
1936   Was a most Sainted- King: the Queene that bore thee,
1937   Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,
1938   Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,
      <P nn2>
1939   These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
1940   Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,
1941   Thy hope ends heere.
1942   <S {Mal}.> {Macduff}, this Noble passion
1943   Childe of integrity, hath from my soule
1944   Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
1945   To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish {Macbeth},
1946   By many of these traines, hath sought to win me
1947   Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
1948   From ouer- credulous #hast: but God aboue
1949   Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now
1950   I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
1951   Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure
1952   The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
1953   For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
1954   Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,
1955   Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.
1956   At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
1957   The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight
1958   No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking
1959   Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly
1960   Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
1961   Whither indeed, before they heere approach
1962   Old {Seyward} with ten thousand warlike men
1963   Already at a point, was setting foorth:
1964   Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse
1965   Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?
1966  *<S {Macd}.> Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once
1967   'Tis hard to reconcile.
1968   <D {Enter a Doctor}.>
1969   <S {Mal}.> Well, more anon. Comes the King forth
1970   I pray you?
1971   <S {Doct}.> #I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules
1972   That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
1973   The  great assay of #Art. But at his touch,
1974   Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,
1975   They presently amend.  <D {Exit}.>
1976   <S {Mal}.> I thanke you Doctor.
1977   <S {Macd}.> What's the Disease he meanes?
1978   <S {Mal}.> Tis call'd the Euill.
1979   A most myraculous worke in this good King,
1980   Which often since my heere remaine in England,
1981   I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
1982   Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people
1983   All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,
1984   The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,
1985   Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,
1986   Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken
1987   To the succeeding Royalty he leaues
1988   The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,
1989   He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,
1990   And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
1991   That speake him full of Grace.
1992   <D {Enter Rosse}.>
1993   <S {Macd}.> See who comes heere.
1994   <S {Malc}.> My Countryman: but yet I know him not.
1995   <S {Macd}.> My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither.
1996  *<S {Malc}.> I know him now. Good God betimes remoue
1997   The meanes that makes vs Strangers.
1998   <S {Rosse}.> Sir, Amen.
1999   <S {Macd}.> Stands Scotland where it did?
2000   <S {Rosse}.> Alas poore Countrey,
2001   Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot
2002   Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing
2003   But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:
2004  *Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre
2005   Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
2006   A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,
2007   Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
2008   Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
2009   Dying, or ere they sicken.
2010   <S {Macd}.> Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true.
2011   <S {Malc}.> What's the newest griefe?
2012   <S {Rosse}.> That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,
2013   Each minute teemes a new one.
2014   <S {Macd}.> How do's my Wife?
2015   <S {Rosse}.> Why well.
2016   <S {Macd}.> And all my Children?
2017   <S {Rosse}.> Well too.
2018   <S {Macd}.> The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?
2019  *<S {Rosse}.> No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em
2020  *<S {Macd}.> Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?
2021   <S {Rosse}.> When I came hither to transport the Tydings
2022   Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour
2023   Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,
2024   Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,
2025   For that I saw the Tyrants Power a- foot.
2026   Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland
2027   Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,
2028   To doffe their dire distresses.
2029   <S {Malc}.> Bee't their comfort
2030   We are comming thither: Gracious England hath
2031   Lent vs good {Seyward}, and ten thousand men,
2032   An older, and a better Souldier, none
2033   That Christendome giues out.
2034   <S {Rosse}.> Would I could answer
2035   This comfort with the like. But I haue words
2036   That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
2037   Where hearing should not latch them.
2038   <S {Macd}.> What concerne they,
2039   The generall cause, or is it a Fee- griefe
2040   Due to some single brest?
2041   <S {Rosse}.> No minde that's honest
2042   But in it shares some woe, though the maine part
2043   Pertaines to you alone.
2044   <S {Macd}.> If it be mine
2045   Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it.
2046  *<S {Rosse}.> Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,
2047   Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
2048   that euer yet they heard.
2049   <S {Macd}.> Humh: I guesse at it.
2050  *<S {Rosse}.> Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes
2051   Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner
2052   Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere
2053   To adde the death of you.
2054   <S {Malc}.> Mercifull Heauen:
2055   What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:
2056   Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,
2057   Whispers the o're- fraught heart, and bids it breake.
2058   <S {Macd}.> My Children too?
2059  *<S {Ro}.> Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found.
2060  *<S {Macd}.> And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?
2061   <S {Rosse}.> I haue said.
2062   <S {Malc}.> Be comforted.
2063   Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,
2064   To cure this deadly greefe.
2065   <S {Macd}.> He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?
2066   Did you say All? Oh Hell- Kite! All?
2067   What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme
2068   At one fell swoope?
2069   <S {Malc}.> Dispute it like a man.
2070   <S {Macd}.> I shall do so:
      <P nn2v>
2071   But I must also feele it as a man;
2072   I cannot but remember such things were
2073   That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
2074   And would not take their part? Sinfull {Macduff},
2075   They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,
2076   Not for their owne demerits, but for mine
2077   Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now.
2078  *<S {Mal}.> Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe
2079   Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it.
2080   <S {Macd}.> O I could play the woman with mine eyes,
2081   And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
2082   Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
2083   Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe
2084   Within my Swords length set him, if he scape
2085   Heauen forgiue him too.
2086   <S {Mal}.> This time goes manly:
2087   Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,
2088   Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. {Macbeth}
2089   Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
2090  *Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,
2091   The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.  <D {Exeunt}>
2092   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2093   <D {Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting}
2094   {Gentlewoman}.>
2095  *<S {Doct}.> I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can
2096  *perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last
2097   walk'd?
2098  *<S {Gent}.> Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue
2099  *seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night- Gown vp-pon
2100  *her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,
2101  *write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe re-turne
2102   to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe.
2103  *<S {Doct}.> A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at
2104  *once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
2105  *In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
2106  *actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard
2107   her say?
2108   <S {Gent}.> That Sir, which I will not report after her.
2109  *<S {Doct}.> You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.
2110  *<S {Gent}.> Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse
2111   to confirme my speech.   <D {Enter Lady, with a Taper}.>
2112  *Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vp-on
2113   my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close.
2114   <S {Doct}.> How came she by that light?
2115  *<S {Gent}.> Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her con-tinually,
2116   'tis her command.
2117   <S {Doct}.> You see her eyes are open.
2118   <S {Gent}.> #I, but their sense are shut.
2119   <S {Doct}.> What is it she do's now?
2120   Looke how she rubbes her hands.
2121  *<S {Gent}.> It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme
2122  *thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in
2123   this a quarter of an houre.
2124   <S {Lad}.> Yet heere's a spot.
2125  *<S {Doct}.> Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes
2126  *from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly.
2127  *<S {La}.> Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why
2128  *then 'tis time to doo't: #Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,
2129  *a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes
2130  *it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who
2131  *would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much
2132   blood in him.
2133   <S {Doct}.> Do you marke that?
2134  *<S {Lad}.> The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?
2135  *What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that
2136  *my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this star-ting.
2137  _
2138   <S {Doct}.> Go too, go too:
2139   You haue knowne what you should not.
2140  *<S {Gent}.> She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure
2141   of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne.
2142  *<S {La}.> Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the per-fumes
2143   of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
2144   Oh, oh, oh.
2145  *<S {Doct}.> What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd.
2146  *<S {Gent}.> I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
2147   for the dignity of the whole body.
2148   <S {Doct}.> Well, well, well.
2149   <S {Gent}.> Pray God it be sir.
2150  *<S {Doct}.> This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue
2151  *knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue
2152   dyed holily in their beds.
2153  *<S {Lad}.> Wash your hands, put on your Night- Gowne,
2154  *looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe {Banquo}'s buried;
2155   he cannot come out on's graue.
2156   <S {Doct}.> Euen so?
2157  *<S {Lady}.> To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
2158  *Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
2159  *done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
2160   <D {Exit Lady}.>
2161   <S {Doct}.> Will she go now to bed?
2162   <S {Gent}.> Directly.
2163  *<S {Doct}.> Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
2164   Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
2165   To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
2166   More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
2167   God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
2168   Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
2169   And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
2170   My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
2171   I thinke, but dare not speake.
2172   <S {Gent}.> Good night good Doctor.  <D {Exeunt}.>

2174   <D {Drum and Colours. Enter Menteth, Cathnes},

2176  *<S {Ment}.> The English powre is neere, led on by {Malcolm},
2177   His Vnkle {Seyward}, and the good {Macduff}.
2178   Reuenges burne in them: for their deere causes
2179   Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme
2180   Excite the mortified man.
2181   <S {Ang}.> Neere Byrnan wood
2182   Shall we well meet them, that way are they comming.
2183  *<S {Cath}.> Who knowes if {Donalbane} be with his brother?
2184   <S {Len}.> For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File
2185   Of all the Gentry; there is {Seywards} Sonne,
2186   And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
2187   Protest their first of Manhood.
2188   <S {Ment}.> What do's the Tyrant.
2189   <S {Cath}.> Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:
2190   Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,
2191   Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine
      <P nn3>
2192   He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
2193   Within the belt of Rule.
2194   <S {Ang}.> Now do's he feele
2195   His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
2196   Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith- breach:
2197   Those he commands, moue onely in command,
2198   Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
2199   Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
2200   Vpon a dwarfish Theefe.
2201   <S {Ment}.> Who then shall blame
2202   His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
2203   When all that is within him, do's condemne
2204   It selfe, for being there.
2205   <S {Cath}.> Well, march we on,
2206   To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
2207   Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
2208   And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
2209   Each drop of vs.
2210   <S {Lenox}.> Or so much as it needes,
2211  *To dew the Soueraigne Flower, and drowne the Weeds:
2212   Make we our March towards Birnan. <D {Exeunt marching}.>
2213   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>

2215   <S {Macb}.> Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:
2216   Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,
2217   I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy {Malcolme}?
2218   Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know
2219   All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:
2220   Feare not {Macbeth}, no man that's borne of woman
2221   Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,
2222   And mingle with the English Epicures,
2223   The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,
2224   Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.

2228   <S {Ser}.> There is ten thousand.
2229   <S {Macb}.> Geese Villaine?
2230   <S {Ser}.> Souldiers Sir.
2231   <S {Macb}.> Go pricke thy face, and ouer- red thy feare
2232   Thou Lilly- liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?
2233   Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine
2234   Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay- face?
2235   <S {Ser}.> The English Force, so please you.
2236  *<S {Macb}.> Take thy face hence. {Seyton}, I am sick at hart,
2237   When I behold: {Seyton}, I say, this push
2238   Will cheere me euer, or dis- eate me now.
2239   I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
2240   Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
2241   And that which should accompany Old- Age,
2242   As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
2243   I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
2244   Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth- honor, breath
2245   Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.
2246   {Seyton}?
2247   <D {Enter Seyton}.>
2248   <S {Sey}.> What's your gracious pleasure?
2249   <S {Macb}.> What Newes more?
2250   <S {Sey}.> All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported.
2251  *<S {Macb}.> Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
2252   Giue me my Armor.
2253   <S {Seyt}.> 'Tis not needed yet.
2254   <S {Macb}.> Ile put it on:
2255   Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,
2256  *Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:
2257   How do's your Patient, Doctor?
2258   <S {Doct}.> Not so sicke my Lord,
2259   As she is troubled with thicke- comming Fancies
2260   That keepe her from her rest.
2261   <S {Macb}.> Cure of that:
2262   Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,
2263   Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,
2264   Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,
2265   And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
2266   Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe
2267   Which weighes vpon the heart?
2268   <S {Doct}.> Therein the Patient
2269   Must minister to himselfe.
2270   <S {Macb}.> Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.
2271   Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:
2272   {Seyton}, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:
2273   Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast
2274   The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,
2275   And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
2276   I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,
2277   That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
2278   What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge
2279   Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?
2280   <S {Doct}.> #I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation
2281   Makes vs heare something.
2282   <S {Macb}.> Bring it after me:
2283   I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
2284   Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane.
2285   <S {Doct}.> Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,
2286   Profit againe should hardly draw me heere.  <D {Exeunt}>
2287   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2288  *<D {Drum and Colours. Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe},
2289   {Seywards Sonne, Menteth, Cathnes, Angus},
2290   {and Soldiers Marching}.>
2291   <S {Malc}.> Cosins, I hope the dayes are neere at hand
2292   That Chambers will be safe.
2293   <S {Ment}.> We doubt it nothing.
2294   <S {Seyw}.> What wood is this before vs?
2295   <S {Ment}.> The wood of Birnane.
2296  *<S {Malc}.> Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,
2297   And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow
2298   The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery
2299   Erre in report of vs.
2300   <S {Sold}.> It shall be done.
2301  *<S {Syw}.> We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant
2302   Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure
2303   Our setting downe befor't.
2304   <S {Malc}.> 'Tis his maine hope:
2305   For where there is aduantage to be giuen,
2306   Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,
2307   And none serue with him, but constrained things,
2308   Whose hearts are absent too.
2309   <S {Macd}.> Let our iust Censures
2310   Attend the true euent, and put we on
      <P nn3v>
2311   Industrious Souldiership.
2312   <S {Sey}.> The time approaches,
2313   That will with due decision make vs know
2314   What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:
2315   Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,
2316   But certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,
2317   Towards which, aduance the warre.  <D {Exeunt marching}>
2318   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
2319   <D {Enter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with}
2320   {Drum and Colours}.>
2321  *<S {Macb}.> Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,
2322   The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength
2323   Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,
2324   Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
2325   Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
2326   We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,
2327   And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
2328   <D {A Cry within of Women}.>
2329   <S {Sey}.> It is the cry of women, my good Lord.
2330   <S {Macb}.> I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:
2331   The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd
2332   To heare a Night- shrieke, and my Fell of haire
2333   Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre
2334   As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,
2335   Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
2336   Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?
2337   <S {Sey}.> The Queene (my Lord) is dead.
2338   <S {Macb}.> She should haue dy'de heereafter;
2339   There would haue beene a time for such a word:
2340   To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,
2341   Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,
2342   To the last Syllable of Recorded time:
2343   And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
2344   The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,
2345   Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,
2346   That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
2347   And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
2348   Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
2349   Signifying nothing.  <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2350   Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly.
2351   <S {Mes}.> Gracious my Lord,
2352   I should report that which I say I saw,
2353   But know not how to doo't.
2354   <S {Macb}.> Well, say sir.
2355   <S {Mes}.> As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill
2356   I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
2357   The Wood began to moue.
2358   <S {Macb}.> Lyar, and Slaue.
2359   <S {Mes}.> Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
2360   Within this three Mile may you see it comming.
2361   I say, a mouing Groue.
2362   <S {Macb}.> If thou speak'st false,
2363   Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue
2364   Till Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,
2365   I care not if thou dost for me as much.
2366   I pull in Resolution, and begin
2367   To doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,
2368   That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood
2369   Do come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood
2370   Comes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,
2371   If this which he auouches, do's appeare,
2372   There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
2373   I 'ginne to be a- weary of the Sun,
2374   And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
2375   Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,
2376   At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.  <D {Exeunt}>
2377   <Z {Scena Sexta}.>
2378   <D {Drumme and Colours}.
2379   {Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe, and their Army},

2381   <S {Mal}.> Now neere enough:
2382   Your leauy Skreenes throw downe,
2383   And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
2384   Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne
2385   Leade our first Battell. Worthy {Macduffe}, and wee
2386   Shall take vpon's what else remaines to do,
2387   According to our order.
2388   <S {Sey}.> Fare you well:
2389   Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,
2390   Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight.
2391  *<S {Macd}.> Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath
2392  *Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.  <D {Exeunt}>
2393   <D {Alarums continued}.>
2394   <Z {Scena Septima}.>
2395   <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
2396   <S {Macb}.> They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,
2397   But Beare- like I must fight the course. What's he
2398   That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
2399   Am I to feare, or none.
2400   <D {Enter young Seyward}.>
2401   <S {Y.Sey}.> What is thy name?
2402   <S {Macb}.> Thou'lt be affraid to heare it.
2403  *<S {Y.Sey}.> No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name
2404   Then any is in #hell.
2405   <S {Macb}.> My name's {Macbeth}.
2406  *<S {Y.Sey}.> The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title
2407   More hatefull to mine eare.
2408   <S {Macb}.> No: nor more fearefull.
2409   <S {Y.Sey}.> Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword
2410   Ile proue the lye thou speak'st.
2411   <D {Fight, and young Seyward slaine}.>
2412   <S {Macb}.> Thou was't borne of woman;
2413   But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,
2414   Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.  <D {Exit}.>
2415   <D {Alarums. Enter Macduffe}.>
2416  *<S {Macd}.> That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,
2417   If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
2418   My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
2419   I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
2420   Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou {Macbeth},
2421   Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
2422   I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
2423   By this great clatter, one of greatest note
      <P nn4>
2424   Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
2425   And more I begge not.  <D {Exit.  Alarums}.>
2426   <D {Enter Malcolme and Seyward}.>
2427  *<S {Sey}.> This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:
2428   The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,
2429   The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,
2430   The day almost it selfe professes yours,
2431   And little is to do.
2432   <S {Malc}.> We haue met with Foes
2433   That strike beside vs.
2434   <S {Sey}.> Enter Sir, the Castle.  <D {Exeunt.  Alarum}>
2435   <D {Enter Macbeth}.>
2436  *<S {Macb}.> Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye
2437   On mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes
2438   Do better vpon them.
2439   <D {Enter Macduffe}.>
2440   <S {Macd}.> Turne Hell- hound, turne.
2441   <S {Macb}.> Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:
2442   But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd
2443   With blood of thine already.
2444   <S {Macd}.> I haue no words,
2445   My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine
2446   Then tearmes can giue thee out.  <D {Fight: Alarum}>
2447   <S {Macb}.> Thou loosest labour
2448   As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
2449   With thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:
2450   Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,
2451   I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
2452   To one of woman borne.
2453   <S {Macd}.> Dispaire thy Charme,
2454   And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
2455   Tell thee, {Macduffe} was from his Mothers womb
2456   Vntimely ript.
2457   <S {Macb}.> Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;
2458   For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:
2459   And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
2460   That palter with vs in a double sence,
2461   That keepe the word of promise to our eare,
2462   And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee.
2463   <S {Macd}.> Then yeeld thee Coward,
2464   And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.
2465   Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are
2466   Painted vpon a pole, and vnder- writ,
2467   Heere may you see the Tyrant.
2468   <S {Macb}.> I will not yeeld
2469   To kisse the ground before young {Malcolmes} feet,
2470   And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
2471   Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,
2472   And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
2473   Yet I will try the last. Before my body,
2474   I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on {Macduffe},
2475   And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.
2476   <D {Exeunt fighting.  Alarums}.>

2480  *<S {Mal}.> I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd.
2481   <S {Sey}.> Some must go off: and yet by these I see,
2482   So great a day as this is cheapely bought.
2483   <S {Mal}.> {Macduffe} is missing, and your Noble Sonne.
2484   <S {Rosse}.> Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,
2485   He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
2486   The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd
2487   In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
2488   But like a man he dy'de.
2489   <S {Sey}.> Then he is dead?
2490  *<S {Rosse}.> #I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
2491   Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
2492   It hath no end.
2493   <S {Sey}.> Had he his hurts before?
2494   <S {Rosse}.> #I, on the Front.
2495   <S {Sey}.> Why then, Gods Soldier be he:
2496   Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,
2497   I would not wish them to a fairer death:
2498   And so his Knell is knoll'd.
2499   <S {Mal}.> Hee's worth more sorrow,
2500   and that Ile spend for him.
2501   <S {Sey}.> He's worth no more,
2502   They say he parted well, and paid his score,
2503   And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
2504   <D {Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head}.>
2505   <S {Macd}.> Haile King, for so thou art.
2506   Behold where stands
2507   Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
2508   I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
2509   That speake my salutation in their minds:
2510   Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.
2511   Haile King of Scotland.
2512   <S {All}.> Haile King of Scotland.  <D {Flourish}.>
2513   <S {Mal}.> We shall not spend a large expence of time,
2514   Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,
2515   And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
2516   Henceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland
2517   In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
2518   Which would be planted newly with the time,
2519   As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
2520   That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,
2521   Producing forth the cruell Ministers
2522   Of this dead Butcher, and his Fiend- like Queene;
2523   Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,
2524   Tooke off her life. This, and what need full else
2525   That call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,
2526   We will performe in measure, time, and place:
2527   So thankes to all at once, and to each one,
2528   Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.
