3      <D {Enter Rumour}.>
4      Open your Eares: For which of you will stop
5     *The vent of Hearing, when loud {Rumor} speakes?
6      I, from the Orient, to the drooping West
7     *(Making the winde my Post- horse) still vnfold
8      The Acts commenced on this Ball of Earth.
9      Vpon my Tongue, continuall Slanders ride,
10     The which, in euery Language, I pronounce,
11     Stuffing the Eares of them with false Reports:
12     I speake of Peace, while couert Enmitie
13     (Vnder the smile of Safety) wounds the World:
14     And who but {Rumour}, who but onely I
15     Make fearfull Musters, and prepar'd Defence,
16    *Whil'st the bigge yeare, swolne with some other griefes,
17     Is thought with childe, by the sterne Tyrant, Warre,
18     And no such matter? {Rumour}, is a Pipe
19     Blowne by Surmises, Ielousies, Coniectures;
20     And of so easie, and so plaine a stop,
21     That the blunt Monster, with vncounted heads,
22     The still discordant, wauering Multitude,
23     Can play vpon it. But what neede I thus
24     My well- knowne Body to Anathomize
25     Among my houshold? Why is {Rumour} heere?
26     I run before King {Harries} victory,
27     Who in a bloodie field by Shrewsburie
28     Hath beaten downe yong {Hotspurre}, and his Troopes,
29     Quenching the flame of bold Rebellion,
30     Euen with the Rebels blood. But what meane I
31     To speake so true at first? My Office is
32     To noyse abroad, that {Harry Monmouth} fell
33     Vnder the Wrath of Noble {Hotspurres} Sword:
34     And that the King, before the {Dowglas} Rage
35     Stoop'd his Annointed head, as low as death.
36     This haue I rumour'd through the peasant- Townes,
37     Betweene the Royall Field of Shrewsburie,
38     And this Worme- eaten- Hole of ragged Stone,
39     Where {Hotspurres} Father, old Northumberland,
40     Lyes crafty sicke. The Postes come tyring on,
41     And not a man of them brings other newes
42    *Then they haue learn'd of Me. From {Rumours} Tongues,
43    *They bring smooth- Comforts- false, worse then True- wrongs.

46     <D {Enter Lord Bardolfe, and the Porter}.>
47     <S {L.Bar}.> Who keepes the Gate heere hoa?
48     Where is the Earle?
49     <S {Por}.> What shall I say you are?
50     <S {Bar}.> Tell thou the Earle
51     That the Lord {Bardolfe} doth attend him heere.
52     <S {Por}.> His Lordship is walk'd forth into the Orchard,
53     Please it your Honor, knocke but at the Gate,
54     And he himselfe will answer.
55     <D {Enter Northumberland}.>
56     <S {L.Bar}.> Heere comes the Earle.
57    *<S {Nor}.> What newes Lord {Bardolfe}? Eu'ry minute now
58     Should be the Father of some Stratagem;
59     The Times are wilde: Contention (like a Horse
60     Full of high Feeding) madly hath broke loose,
61     And beares downe all before him.
62     <S {L.Bar}.> Noble Earle,
63     I bring you certaine newes from Shrewsbury.
64     <S {Nor}.> Good, #and heauen will.
65     <S {L.Bar}.> As good as heart can wish:
66     The King is almost wounded to the death:
67     And in the Fortune of my Lord your Sonne,
68     Prince {Harrie} slaine out- right: and both the {Blunts}
69     Kill'd by the hand of {Dowglas}. Yong Prince {Iohn},
70     And Westmerland, and Stafford, fled the Field.
71     And {Harrie Monmouth's} Brawne (the Hulke Sir {Iohn})
72     Is prisoner to your Sonne. O, such a Day,
73     (So fought, so follow'd, and so fairely wonne)
74     Came not, till now, to dignifie the Times
75     Since {Caesars} Fortunes.
76     <S {Nor}.> How is this deriu'd?
77     Saw you the Field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
78    *<S {L.Bar}.> I spake with one (my L[ord].) that came fro[m] thence,
79     A Gentleman well bred, and of good name,
80     That freely render'd me these newes for true.
81     <S {Nor}.> Heere comes my Seruant {Trauers}, whom I sent
82     On Tuesday last, to listen after Newes.
83     <D {Enter Trauers}.>
84     <S {L.Bar}.> My Lord, I ouer- rod him on the way,
85     And he is furnish'd with no certainties,
86     More then he (haply) may retaile from me.
87    *<S {Nor}.> Now {Trauers}, what good tidings comes fro[m] you?
      <P g1>
88     <S {Tra}.> My Lord, Sir {Iohn Vmfreuill} turn'd me backe
89     With ioyfull tydings; and (being better hors'd)
90     Out- rod me. After him, came spurring head
91     A Gentleman (almost fore- spent with speed)
92     That stopp'd by me, to breath his bloodied horse.
93     He ask'd the way to Chester: And of him
94     I did demand what Newes from Shrewsbury:
95     He told me, that Rebellion had #ill lucke,
96     And that yong {Harry Percies} Spurre was cold.
97     With that he gaue his able Horse the head,
98     And bending forwards strooke his able heeles
99     Against the panting sides of his poore Iade
100    Vp to the Rowell head, and starting so,
101    He seem'd in running, to deuoure the way,
102    Staying no longer question.
103    <S {North}.> Ha? Againe:
104    Said he yong {Harrie Percyes} Spurre was cold?
105    (Of {Hot- Spurre}, cold- Spurre?) that Rebellion,
106    Had met #ill lucke?
107    <S {L.Bar}.> My Lord: Ile tell you what,
108    If my yong Lord your Sonne, haue not the day,
109    Vpon mine Honor, for a silken point
110    Ile giue my Barony. Neuer talke of it.
111   *<S {Nor}.> Why should the Gentleman that rode by {Trauers}
112    Giue then such instances of Losse?
113    <S {L.Bar}.> Who, he?
114    He was some hielding Fellow, that had stolne
115    The Horse he rode- on: and vpon my life
116    Speake at aduenture. Looke, here comes more Newes.
117    <D {Enter Morton}.>
118    <S {Nor}.> Yea, this mans brow, like to a Title- leafe,
119    Fore- tels the Nature of a Tragicke Volume:
120    So lookes the Strond, when the Imperious Flood
121    Hath left a witnest Vsurpation.
122    Say {Morton}, did'st thou come from Shrewsbury?
123    <S {Mor}.> I ran from Shrewsbury (my Noble Lord)
124    Where hatefull death put on his vgliest Maske
125    To fright our party.
126    <S {North}.> How doth my Sonne, and Brother?
127    Thou trembl'st; and the whitenesse in thy Cheeke
128    Is apter then thy Tongue, to tell thy Errand.
129    Euen such a man, so faint, so spiritlesse,
130    So dull, so dead in looke, so woe- be- gone,
131    Drew {Priams} Curtaine, in the dead of night,
132    And would haue told him, Halfe his Troy was burn'd.
133    But {Priam} found the Fire, ere he his Tongue:
134    And I, my {Percies} death, ere thou report'st it.
135   *This, thou would'st say: Your Sonne did thus, and thus:
136    Your Brother, thus. So fought the Noble {Dowglas},
137    Stopping my greedy eare, with their bold deeds.
138    But in the end (to stop mine Eare indeed)
139    Thou hast a Sigh, to blow away this Praise,
140    Ending with Brother, Sonne, and all are dead.
141    <S {Mor}.> {Dowglas} is liuing, and your Brother, yet:
142    But for my Lord, your Sonne.
143    <S {North}.> Why, he is dead.
144    See what a ready tongue Suspition hath:
145    He that but feares the thing, he would not know,
146    Hath by Instinct, knowledge from others Eyes,
147    That what he feard, is chanc'd. Yet speake ({Morton})
148    Tell thou thy Earle, his Diuination Lies,
149    And I will take it, as a sweet Disgrace,
150    And make thee rich, for doing me such wrong.
151    <S {Mor}.> You are too great, to be (by me) gainsaid:
152    Your Spirit is too true, your Feares too certaine.
153    <S {North}.> Yet for all this, say not that {Percie}s dead.
154    I see a strange Confession in thine Eye:
155    Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it Feare, or Sinne,
156    To speake a truth. If he be slaine, say so:
157    The Tongue offends not, that reports his death:
158    And he doth sinne that doth belye the dead:
159    Not he, which sayes the dead is not aliue:
160    Yet the first bringer of vnwelcome Newes
161    Hath but a loosing Office: and his Tongue,
162    Sounds euer after as a sullen Bell
163    Remembred, knolling a departing Friend.
164    <S {L.Bar}.> I cannot thinke (my Lord) your son is dead.
165    <S {Mor}.> I am sorry, I should force you to beleeue
166    That, which I would to heauen, I had not seene.
167    But these mine eyes, saw him in bloody state,
168    Rend'ring faint quittance (wearied, and out- breath'd)
169    To {Henrie Monmouth}, whose swift wrath beate downe
170    The neuer- daunted {Percie} to the earth,
171    From whence (with life) he neuer more sprung vp.
172    In few; his death (whose spirit lent a fire,
173    Euen to the dullest Peazant in his Campe)
174    Being bruited once, tooke fire and heate away
175    From the best temper'd Courage in his Troopes.
176    For from his Mettle, was his Party steel'd;
177    Which once, in him abated, all the rest
178    Turn'd on themselues, like dull and heauy Lead:
179    And as the Thing, that's heauy in it selfe,
180    Vpon enforcement, flyes with greatest speede,
181    So did our Men, heauy in {Hotspurres} losse,
182    Lend to this weight, such lightnesse with their Feare,
183    That Arrowes fled not swifter toward their ayme,
184    Then did our Soldiers (ayming at their safety)
185    Fly from the field. Then was that Noble Worcester
186    Too soone ta'ne prisoner: and that furious Scot,
187    (The bloody {Dowglas}) whose well- labouring sword
188    Had three times slaine th' appearance of the King,
189    Gan vaile his stomacke, and did grace the shame
190    Of those that turn'd their backes: and in his flight,
191    Stumbling in Feare, was tooke. The summe of all,
192    Is, that the King hath wonne: and hath sent out
193    A speedy power, to encounter you my Lord,
194    Vnder the Conduct of yong Lancaster
195    And Westmerland. This is the Newes at full.
196   *<S {North}.> For this, I shall haue time enough to mourne.
197    In Poyson, there is Physicke: and this newes
198    (Hauing beene well) that would haue made me sicke,
199    Being sicke, haue in some measure, made me well.
200    And as the Wretch, whose Feauer- weakned ioynts,
201    Like strengthlesse Hindges, buckle vnder life,
202    Impatient of his Fit, breakes like a fire
203    Out of his keepers armes: Euen so, my Limbes
204   *(Weak'ned with greefe) being now inrag'd with greefe,
205   *Are thrice themselues. Hence therefore thou nice crutch,
206    A scalie Gauntlet now, with ioynts of Steele
207    Must gloue this hand. And hence thou sickly Quoife,
208    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head,
209    Which Princes, flesh'd with Conquest, ayme to hit.
210    Now binde my Browes with Iron and approach
211    The ragged'st houre, that Time and Spight dare bring
212    To frowne vpon th' enrag'd Northumberland.
213    Let Heauen kisse Earth: now let not Natures hand
214    Keepe the wilde Flood confin'd: Let Order dye,
215    And let the world no longer be a stage
216    To feede Contention in a ling'ring Act:
217    But let one spirit of the First- borne {Caine}
      <P g1v>
218    Reigne in all bosomes, that each heart being set
219    On bloody Courses, the rude Scene may end,
220    And darknesse be the burier of the dead.
221   *<S {L.Bar}.> Sweet Earle, diuorce not wisedom from your |(Honor.
222    <S {Mor}.> The liues of all your louing Complices
223    Leane- on your health, the which if you giue- o're
224    To stormy Passion, must perforce decay.
225    You cast th' euent of Warre (my Noble Lord)
226    And summ'd the accompt of Chance, before you said
227    Let vs make head: It was your presurmize,
228    That in the dole of blowes, your Son might drop.
229    You knew he walk'd o're perils, on an edge
230    More likely to fall in, then to get o're:
231    You were aduis'd his flesh was capeable
232    Of Wounds, and Scarres; and that his forward Spirit
233    Would lift him, where most trade of danger rang'd,
234    Yet did you say go forth: and none of this
235    (Though strongly apprehended) could restraine
236    The stiffe- borne Action: What hath then befalne?
237    Or what hath this bold enterprize bring forth,
238    More then that #Being, which was like to be?
239    <S {L.Bar}.> We all that are engaged to this losse,
240    Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous Seas,
241    That if we wrought out life, was ten to one:
242    And yet we ventur'd for the gaine propos'd,
243    Choak'd the respect of likely perill fear'd,
244    And since we are o're- set, venture againe.
245    Come, we will all put forth; Body, and Goods,
246   *<S {Mor}.> 'Tis more then time: And (my most Noble Lord)
247    I heare for certaine, and do speake the truth:
248    The gentle Arch- bishop of Yorke is vp
249    With well appointed Powres: he is a man
250    Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.
251    My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,
252    But shadowes, and the shewes of men to fight.
253    For that same word (Rebellion) did diuide
254    The action of their bodies, from their soules,
255    And they did fight with queasinesse, constrain'd
256    As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only
257    Seem'd on our side: but for their Spirits and Soules,
258    This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,
259    As Fish are in a Pond. But now the Bishop
260    Turnes Insurrection to Religion,
261    Suppos'd sincere, and holy in his Thoughts:
262    He's follow'd both with Body, and with Minde:
263    And doth enlarge his Rising, with the blood
264    Of faire King {Richard}, scrap'd from Pomfret stones,
265    Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause:
266    Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding Land,
267    Gasping for life, vnder great {Bullingbrooke},
268    And more, and lesse, do flocke to follow him.
269    <S {North}.> I knew of this before. But to speake truth,
270    This present greefe had wip'd it from my minde.
271    Go in with me, and councell euery man
272    The aptest way for safety, and reuenge:
273    Get Posts, and Letters, and make Friends with speed,
274    Neuer so few, nor neuer yet more need.  <D {Exeunt}.>
275    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
276    <D {Enter Falstaffe, and Page}.>
277   *<S {Fal}.> Sirra, you giant, what saies the Doct[or]. to my water?
278   *<S {Pag}.> He said sir, the water it selfe was a good healthy
279   *water: but for the party that ow'd it, he might haue more
280    diseases then he knew for.
281   *<S {Fal}.> Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at mee: the
282   *braine of this foolish compounded Clay- man, is not able
283   *to inuent any thing that tends to laughter, more then I
284   *inuent, or is inuented on me. I am not onely witty in my
285   *selfe, but the cause that wit is in other men. I doe heere
286   *walke before thee, like a Sow, that hath o'rewhelm'd all
287   *her Litter, but one. If the Prince put thee into my Ser-uice
288   *for any other reason, then to set mee off, why then I
289   *haue no iudgement. Thou horson Mandrake, thou art
290   *fitter to be worne in my cap, then to wait at my heeles. I
291   *was neuer mann'd with an Agot till now: but I will sette
292   *you neyther in Gold, nor Siluer, but in vilde apparell, and
293   *send you backe againe to your Master, for a Iewell. The
294   *{Iuuenall} (the Prince your Master) whose Chin is not yet
295   *fledg'd, I will sooner haue a beard grow in the Palme of
296   *my hand, then he shall get one on his cheeke: yet he will
297   *not sticke to say, his Face is a Face- Royall. Heauen may
298   *finish it when he will, it is not a haire amisse yet: he may
299   *keepe it still at a Face- Royall, for a Barber shall neuer
300   *earne six pence out of it; and yet he will be crowing, as if
301   *he had writ man euer since his Father was a Batchellour.
302   *He may keepe his owne Grace, but he is almost out of
303   *mine, I can assure him. What said M[aster]. {Dombledon}, about
304    the Satten for my short Cloake, and Slops?
305   *<S {Pag}.> He said sir, you should procure him better Assu-rance,
306   *then {Bardolfe}: he wold not take his Bond & yours,
307    he lik'd not the Security.
308   *<S {Fal}.> Let him bee damn'd like the Glutton, may his
309   *Tongue be hotter, a horson {Achitophel}; a Rascally- yea- forsooth- knaue,
310   *to beare a Gentleman in hand, and then
311   *stand vpon Security? The horson smooth- pates doe now
312   *weare nothing but high shoes, and bunches of Keyes at
313   *their girdles: and if a man is through with them in ho-nest
314   *Taking- vp, then they must stand vpon Securitie: I
315   *had as liefe they would put Rats- bane in my mouth, as
316   *offer to stoppe it with Security. I look'd hee should haue
317   *sent me two and twenty yards of Satten (as I am true
318   *Knight) and he sends me Security. Well, he may sleep in
319   *Security, for he hath the horne of Abundance: and the
320   *lightnesse of his Wife shines through it, and yet cannot
321   *he see, though he haue his owne Lanthorne to light him.
322    Where's {Bardolfe}?
323   *<S {Pag}.> He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship
324    a horse.
325   *<S {Fal}.> I bought him in Paules, and hee'l buy mee a horse
326   *in Smithfield. If I could get mee a wife in the Stewes, I
327    were Mann'd, Hors'd, and Wiu'd.
328    <D {Enter Chiefe Iustice, and Seruant}.>
329   *<S {Pag}.> Sir, heere comes the Nobleman that committed
330    the Prince for striking him, about {Bardolfe}.
331    <S {Fal}.> Wait close, I will not see him.
332    <S {Ch.Iust}.> What's he that goes there?
333    <S {Ser}.> {Falstaffe}, and't please your Lordship.
334    <S {Iust}.> He that was in question for the Robbery?
335   *<S {Ser}.> He my Lord, but he hath since done good seruice
336   *at Shrewsbury: and (as I heare) is now going with some
337    Charge, to the Lord {Iohn of Lancaster}.
338    <S {Iust}.> What to Yorke? Call him backe againe.
339    <S {Ser}.> Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}.
340    <S {Fal}.> Boy, tell him, I am deafe.
341    <S {Pag}.> You must speake lowder, my Master is deafe.
342   *<S {Iust}.> I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
343    Go plucke him by the Elbow, I must speake with him.
344    <S {Ser}.> Sir {Iohn}.
345   *<S {Fal}.> What? a yong knaue and beg? Is there not wars? Is
346   *there not imployment? Doth not the K[ing]. lack subiects? Do
347   *not the Rebels want Soldiers? Though it be a shame to be
      <P g2>
348   *on any side but one, it is worse shame to begge, then to
349   *be on the worst side, were it worse then the name of Re-bellion
350    can tell how to make it.
351    <S {Ser}.> You mistake me Sir.
352   *<S {Fal}.> Why sir? Did I say you were an honest man? Set-ting
353   *my Knight- hood, and my Souldiership aside, I had
354    lyed in my throat, if I had said so.
355   *<S {Ser}.> I pray you (Sir) then set your Knighthood and
356   *your Souldier- ship aside, and giue mee leaue to tell you,
357   *you lye in your throat, if you say I am any other then an
358    honest man.
359   *<S {Fal}.> I giue thee leaue to tell me so? I lay a- side that
360   *which growes to me? If thou get'st any leaue of me, hang
361   *me: if thou tak'st leaue, thou wer't better be hang'd: you
362    Hunt- counter, hence: Auant.
363    <S {Ser}.> Sir, my Lord would speake with you.
364    <S {Iust}.> Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}, a word with you.
365   *<S {Fal}.> My good Lord: giue your Lordship good time of
366   *the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad: I heard
367   *say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your Lordship goes
368   *abroad by aduise. Your Lordship (though not clean past
369   *your youth) hath yet some smack of age in you: some rel-lish
370   *of the saltnesse of Time, and I most humbly beseech
371    your Lordship, to haue a reuerend care of your health.
372   *<S {Iust}.> Sir {Iohn}, I sent you before your Expedition, to
373    Shrewsburie.
374   *<S {Fal}.> If it please your Lordship, I heare his Maiestie is
375    return'd with some discomfort from Wales.
376   *<S {Iust}.> I talke not of his Maiesty: you would not come
377    when I sent for you?
378   *<S {Fal}.> And I heare moreouer, his Highnesse is falne into
379    this same whorson Apoplexie.
380   *<S {Iust}.> Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me speak with |(you.
381   *<S {Fal}.> This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethar-gie,
382    a sleeping of the blood, a horson Tingling.
383    <S {Iust}.> What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
384   *<S {Fal}.> It hath #it originall from much greefe; from study
385   *and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cause of
386    his effects in {Galen}. It is a kinde of deafenesse.
387   *<S {Iust}.> I thinke you are falne into the disease: For you
388    heare not what I say to you.
389   *<S {Fal}.> Very well (my Lord) very well: rather an't please
390   *you) it is the disease of not Listning, the malady of not
391    Marking, that I am troubled withall.
392   *<S {Iust}.> To punish you by the heeles, would amend the
393   *attention of your eares, & I care not if I be your Physitian
394   *<S {Fal}.> I am as poore as {Iob}, my Lord; but not so Patient:
395   *your Lordship may minister the Potion of imprisonment
396   *to me, in respect of Pouertie: but how I should bee your
397   *Patient, to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make
398    some dram of a scruple, or indeede, a scruple it selfe.
399   *<S {Iust}.> I sent for you (when there were matters against
400    you for your life) to come speake with me.
401   *<S {Fal}.> As I was then aduised by my learned Councel, in
402    the lawes of this Land- seruice, I did not come.
403   *<S {Iust}.> Wel, the truth is (sir {Iohn}) you liue in great infamy
404   *<S {Fal}.> He that buckles him in my belt, ca[n]not liue in lesse.
405   *<S {Iust}.> Your Meanes is very slender, and your #wast great.
406   *<S {Fal}.> I would it were otherwise: I would my Meanes
407    were greater, and my waste slenderer.
408    <S {Iust}.> You haue misled the youthfull Prince.
409   *<S {Fal}.> The yong Prince hath misled mee. I am the Fel-low
410    with the great belly, and he my Dogge.
411   *<S {Iust}.> Well, I am loth to gall a new- heal'd wound: your
412   *daies seruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer
413   *your Nights exploit on Gads- hill. You may thanke the
414    vnquiet time, for your quiet o're- posting that Action.
415    <S {Fal}.> My Lord?
416   *<S {Iust}.> But since all is wel, keep it so: wake not a sleeping |(Wolfe.
417    <S {Fal}.> To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to smell a Fox.
418   *<S {Iu}.> What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out
419   *<S {Fal}.> A Wassell- Candle, my Lord; all Tallow: if I did
420    say of wax, my growth would approue the truth.
421   *<S {Iust}.> There is not a white haire on your face, but shold
422    haue his effect of grauity.
423    <S {Fal}.> His effect of grauy, grauy, grauy.
424   *<S {Iust}.> You follow the yong Prince vp and downe, like
425    his euill Angell.
426   *<S {Fal}.> Not so (my Lord) your #ill Angell is light: but I
427   *hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without,
428   *weighing: and yet, in some respects I grant, I cannot go:
429   *I cannot tell. Vertue is of so little regard in these Costor-mongers,
430   *that true valor is turn'd Beare- heard. Pregnan-cie
431   *is made a Tapster, and hath his quicke wit wasted in
432   *giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man
433   *(as the malice of this Age shapes them) are not woorth a
434   *Gooseberry. You that are old, consider not the capaci-ties
435   *of vs that are yong: you measure the heat of our Li-uers,
436   *with the bitternes of your gals: & we that are in the
437    vaward of our youth, I must confesse, are wagges too.
438   *<S {Iust}.> Do you set downe your name in the scrowle of
439   *youth, that are written downe old, with all the Charrac-ters
440   *of age? Haue you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yel-low
441   *cheeke? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an incresing
442   *belly? Is not your voice broken? your winde short? your
443   *wit single? and euery part about you blasted with Anti-quity?
444   *and wil you cal your selfe yong? Fy, fy, fy, sir {Iohn}.
445   *<S {Fal}.> My Lord, I was borne with a white head, & som-thing
446   *a round belly. For my voice, I haue lost it with hal-lowing
447   *and singing of Anthemes. To approue my youth
448   *farther, I will not: the truth is, I am onely olde in iudge-ment
449   *and vnderstanding: and he that will caper with mee
450   *for a thousand Markes, let him lend me the mony, & haue
451   *at him. For the boxe of th' eare that the Prince gaue you,
452   *he gaue it like a rude Prince, and you tooke it like a sensi-ble
453   *Lord. I haue checkt him for it, and the yong Lion re-pents:
454   *Marry not in ashes and sacke- cloath, but in new
455    Silke, and old Sacke.
456   *<S {Iust}.> Wel, heauen send the Prince a better companion.
457   *<S {Fal}.> Heauen send the Companion a better Prince: I
458    cannot rid my hands of him.
459   *<S {Iust}.> Well, the King hath seuer'd you and Prince {Har-ry},
460   *I heare you are going with Lord {Iohn} of Lancaster, a-gainst
461   *the Archbishop, and the Earle of Northumberland
462   *<S {Fal}.> Yes, I thanke your pretty sweet wit for it: but
463   *looke you pray, (all you that kisse my Ladie Peace, at
464   *home) that our Armies ioyn not in a hot day: for if I take
465   *but two shirts out with me, and I meane not to sweat ex-traordinarily:
466   *if it bee a hot day, if I brandish any thing
467   *but my Bottle, would I might neuer spit white againe:
468   *There is not a daungerous Action can peepe out his head,
469    but I am thrust vpon it. Well, I cannot last euer.
470   *<S {Iust}.> Well, be honest, be honest, and heauen blesse your
471    Expedition.
472   *<S {Fal}.> Will your Lordship lend mee a thousand pound,
473    to furnish me forth?
474   *<S {Iust}.> Not a peny, not a peny: you are too impatient
475   *to beare crosses. Fare you well. Commend mee to my
476    Cosin Westmerland.
477   *<S {Fal}.> If I do, fillop me with a three- man- Beetle. A man
478   *can no more separate Age and Couetousnesse, then he can
479   *part yong limbes and letchery: but the Gowt galles the
      <P g2v>
480   *one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the De-grees
481    preuent my curses. Boy?
482    <S {Page}.> Sir.
483    <S {Fal}.> What money is in my purse?
484    <S {Page}.> Seuen groats, and two pence.
485   *<S {Fal}.> I can get no remedy against this Consumption of
486   *the purse. Borrowing onely lingers, and lingers it out,
487   *but the disease is incureable. Go beare this letter to my
488   *Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earle of
489   *Westmerland, and this to old Mistris {Vrsula}, whome I
490   *haue weekly sworne to marry, since I perceiu'd the first
491   *white haire on my chin. About it: you know where to
492   *finde me. A pox of this Gowt, or a Gowt of this Poxe:
493   *for the one or th' other playes the rogue with my great
494   *toe: It is no matter, if I do halt, I haue the warres for my
495   *colour, and my Pension shall seeme the more reasonable.
496   *A good wit will make vse of any thing: I will turne dis-eases
497    to commodity.  <D {Exeunt}>
498    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
499    <D {Enter Archbishop, Hastings, Mowbray, and}
500    {Lord Bardolfe}.>
501   *<S {Ar}.> Thus haue you heard our causes, & kno our Means:
502    And my most noble Friends, I pray you all
503    Speake plainly your opinions of our hopes,
504    And first (Lord Marshall) what say you to it?
505    <S {Mow}.> I well allow the occasion of our Armes,
506    But gladly would be better satisfied,
507    How (in our Meanes) we should aduance our selues
508    To looke with forhead bold and big enough
509    Vpon the Power and puisance of the King.
510    <S {Hast}.> Our present Musters grow vpon the File
511    To fiue and twenty thousand men of choice:
512    And our Supplies, liue largely in the hope
513    Of great Northumberland, whose bosome burnes
514    With an incensed Fire of Iniuries.
515   *<S {L.Bar}.> The question then (Lord {Hastings}) standeth thus
516    Whether our present fiue and twenty thousand
517    May hold- vp- head, without Northumberland:
518    <S {Hast}.> With him, we may.
519    <S {L.Bar}.> #I marry, there's the point:
520    But if without him we be thought #to feeble,
521    My iudgement is, we should not step too farre
522    Till we had his Assistance by the hand.
523    For in a Theame so bloody fac'd, as this,
524    Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise
525    Of Aydes incertaine, should not be admitted.
526    <S {Arch}.> 'Tis very true Lord {Bardolfe}, for indeed
527    It was yong {Hotspurres} case, at Shrewsbury.
528   *<S {L.Bar}.> It was (my Lord) who lin'd himself with hope,
529    Eating the ayre, on promise of Supply,
530    Flatt'ring himselfe with Proiect of a power,
531    Much smaller, then the smallest of his Thoughts,
532    And so with great imagination
533    (Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,
534    And (winking) leap'd into destruction.
535    <S {Hast}.> But (by your leaue) it neuer yet did hurt,
536    To lay downe likely- hoods, and formes of hope.
537    <S {L.Bar}.> Yes, if this present quality of warre,
538    Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,
539    Liues so in hope: As in an early Spring,
540    We see th' appearing buds, which to proue fruite,
541    Hope giues not so much warrant, as Dispaire
542    That Frosts will bite them. When we meane to build,
543    We first suruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,
544    And when we see the figure of the house,
545    Then must we rate the cost of the Erection,
546    Which if we finde out- weighes Ability,
547    What do we then, but draw a- new the Modell
548    In fewer offices? Or at least, desist
549    To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,
550    (Which is (almost) to plucke a Kingdome downe,
551    And set another vp) should we suruey
552    The plot of Situation, and the Modell;
553    Consent vpon a sure Foundation:
554    Question Surueyors, know our owne estate,
555    How able such a Worke to vndergo,
556    To weigh against his Opposite? Or else,
557    We fortifie in Paper, and in Figures,
558    Vsing the Names of men, instead of men:
559    Like one, that drawes the Modell of a house
560    Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)
561    Giues o're, and leaues his part- created Cost
562    A naked subiect to the Weeping Clouds,
563    And waste, for churlish Winters tyranny.
564    <S {Hast}.> Grant that our hopes (yet likely of faire byrth)
565    Should be still- borne: and that we now possest
566    The vtmost man of expectation:
567    I thinke we are a Body strong enough
568    (Euen as we are) to equall with the King.
569   *<S {L.Bar}.> What is the King but fiue & twenty thousand?
570   *<S {Hast}.> To vs no more: nay not so much Lord {Bardolf}.
571    For0his diuisions (as the Times do braul)
572    Are in three Heads: one Power against the French,
573    And one against {Glendower}: Perforce a third
574    Must take vp vs: So is the vnfirme King
575    In three diuided: and his Coffers sound
576    With hollow Pouerty, and Emptinesse.
577   *<S {Ar}.> That he should draw his seuerall strengths togither
578    And come against vs in full puissance
579    Need not be dreaded.
580    <S {Hast}.> If he should do so,
581    He leaues his backe vnarm'd, the French, and Welch
582    Baying him at the heeles: neuer feare that.
583   *<S {L.Bar}.> Who is it like should lead his Forces hither?
584    <S {Hast}.> The Duke of Lancaster, and Westmerland:
585    Against the Welsh himselfe, and {Harrie Monmouth}.
586    But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
587    I haue no certaine notice.
588    <S {Arch}.> Let vs on:
589    And publish the occasion of our Armes.
590    The Common- wealth is sicke of their owne Choice,
591    Their ouer- greedy loue hath surfetted:
592    An habitation giddy, and vnsure
593    Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
594    O thou fond Many, with what loud applause
595    Did'st thou beate heauen with blessing {Bullingbrooke},
596    Before he was, what thou would'st haue him be?
597    And being now trimm'd in thine owne desires,
598    Thou (beastly Feeder) art so full of him,
599    That thou prouok'st thy selfe to cast him vp.
600    So, so, (thou common Dogge) did'st thou disgorge
601    Thy glutton- bosome of the Royall {Richard},
602    And now thou would'st eate thy dead vomit vp,
603    And howl'st to finde it. What trust is in these Times?
604    They, that when {Richard} liu'd, would haue him dye,
605    Are now become enamour'd on his graue.
606    Thou that threw'st dust vpon his goodly head
607    When through proud London he came sighing on,
608    After th' admired heeles of {Bullingbrooke},
609    Cri'st now, O Earth, yeeld vs that King againe,
      <P g3>
610    And take thou this (O thoughts of men accurs'd)
611    {Past, and to Come, seemes best; things Present, worst}.
612    <S {Mow}.> Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
613    <S {Hast}.> We are Times subiects, and Time bids, be gon.
614    <Z {Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima}.>
615    <D {Enter Hostesse, with two Officers, Fang, and Snare}.>
616    <S {Hostesse}.> Mr. {Fang}, haue you entred the Action?
617    <S {Fang}.> It is enter'd.
618   *<S {Hostesse}.> Wher's your Yeoman? Is it a lusty yeoman?
619    Will he stand to it?
620    <S {Fang}.> Sirrah, where's {Snare}?
621    <S {Hostesse}.> #I, #I, good M[aster]. {Snare}.
622    <S {Snare}.> Heere, heere.
623    <S {Fang}.> {Snare}, we must Arrest Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}.
624    <S {Host}.> #I good M[aster]. {Snare}, I haue enter'd him, and all.
625   *<S {Sn}.> It may chance cost some of vs our liues: he wil stab
626   *<S {Hostesse}.> Alas the day: take heed of him: he stabd me
627   *in mine owne house, and that most beastly: he cares not
628   *what mischeefe he doth, if his weapon be out. Hee will
629   *foyne like any diuell, he will spare neither man, woman,
630    nor childe.
631   *<S {Fang}.> If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
632    <S {Hostesse}.> No, nor I neither: Ile be at your elbow.
633   *<S {Fang}.> If I but fist him once: if he come but within my
634    Vice.
635   *<S {Host}.> I am vndone with his going: I warrant he is an
636   *infinitiue thing vpon my score. Good M[aster]. {Fang} hold him
637   *sure: good M[aster]. {Snare} let him not scape, he comes continu-antly
638   *to Py- Corner (sauing your manhoods) to buy a sad-dle,
639   *and hee is indited to dinner to the Lubbars head in
640   *Lombard#street, to M[aster]. {Smoothes} the Silkman. I pra' ye, since
641   *my Exion is enter'd, and my Case so openly known to the
642   *world, let him be brought in to his answer: A 100. Marke
643   *is a long one, for a poore lone woman to beare: & I haue
644   *borne, and borne, and borne, and haue bin fub'd off, and
645   *fub'd- off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to
646   *be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, vnles
647   *a woman should be made an Asse and a Beast, to beare e-uery
648    Knaues wrong.  <D {Enter Falstaffe and Bardolfe}.>
649   *Yonder he comes, and that arrant Malmesey- Nose {Bar-dolfe}
650   *with him. Do your Offices, do your offices: M[aster]. {Fang},
651    & M[aster]. {Snare}, do me, do me, do me your Offices.
652   *<S {Fal}.> How now? whose Mare's dead? what's the matter?
653   *<S {Fang}.> Sir {Iohn}, I arrest you, at the suit of Mist. {Quickly}.
654   *<S {Falst}.> Away Varlets, draw {Bardolfe}: Cut me off the
655    Villaines head: throw the Queane in the Channel.
656   *<S {Host}.> Throw me in the channell? Ile throw thee there.
657   *Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue. Murder, mur-der,
658   *O thou Hony- suckle villaine, wilt thou kill Gods of-ficers,
659   *and the Kings? O thou hony- seed Rogue, thou art
660    a honyseed, a Man- queller, and a woman- queller.
661   *<S {Falst}.> Keep them off, {Bardolfe}. <S {Fang}.> A rescu, a rescu.
662   *<S {Host}.> Good people bring a rescu. Thou wilt not? thou
663    wilt not? Do, do thou Rogue: Do thou Hempseed.
664   *<S {Page}.> Away you Scullion, you Rampallian, you Fustil-lirian:
665    Ile tucke your Catastrophe.  <D {Enter Ch. Iustice}.>
666    <S {Iust}.> What's the matter? Keepe the Peace here, hoa.
667   *<S {Host}.> Good my Lord be good to mee. I beseech you
668    stand to me.
669   *<S {Ch.Iust}.> How now sir {Iohn}? What are you brauling here?
670    Doth this become your place, your time, and businesse?
671    You should haue bene well on your way to Yorke.
672    Stand from him Fellow; wherefore hang'st vpon him?
673   *<S {Host}.> Oh my most worshipfull Lord, and't please your
674   *Grace, I am a poore widdow of Eastcheap, and he is arre-sted
675    at my suit.  <S {Ch.Iust}.> For what summe?
676   *<S {Host}.> It is more then for some (my Lord) it is for all: all
677   *I haue, he hath eaten me out of house and home; hee hath
678   *put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I will
679   *haue some of it out againe, or I will ride thee #o' Nights,
680    like the Mare.
681   *<S {Falst}.> I thinke I am as like to ride the Mare, if I haue
682    any vantage of ground, to get vp.
683   *<S {Ch.Iust}.> How comes this, Sir {Iohn}? Fy, what a man of
684   *good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
685   *Are you not asham'd to inforce a poore Widdowe to so
686    rough a course, to come by her owne?
687    <S {Falst}.> What is the grosse summe that I owe thee?
688   *<S {Host}.> Marry (if thou wer't an honest man) thy selfe, &
689   *the mony too. Thou didst sweare to mee vpon a parcell
690   *gilt Goblet, sitting in my Dolphin- chamber at the round
691   *table, by a sea- cole fire, on Wednesday in Whitson week,
692   *when the Prince broke thy head for lik'ning him to a sin-ging
693   *man of Windsor; Thou didst sweare to me then (as I
694   *was washing thy wound) to marry me, and make mee my
695   *Lady thy wife. Canst y deny it? Did not goodwife  {Keech}
696   *the Butchers wife come in then, and cal me gossip {Quick-ly}?
697   *comming in to borrow a messe of Vinegar: telling vs,
698   *she had a good dish of Prawnes: whereby y didst desire to
699   *eat some: whereby I told thee they were #ill for a greene
700   *wound? And didst not thou (when she was gone downe
701   *staires) desire me to be no more familiar with such poore
702   *people, saying, that ere long they should call me Madam?
703   *And did'st y not kisse me, and bid mee fetch thee 30.#s? I
704    put thee now to thy Book- oath, deny it if thou canst?
705   *<S {Fal}.> My Lord, this is a poore mad soule: and she sayes
706   *vp & downe the town, that her eldest son is like you. She
707   *hath bin in good case, & the truth is, pouerty hath distra-cted
708   *her: but for these foolish Officers, I beseech you, I
709    may haue redresse against them.
710   *<S {Iust}.> Sir {Iohn}, sir {Iohn}, I am well acquainted with your
711   *maner of wrenching the true cause, the false way. It is not
712   *a confident brow, nor the throng of wordes, that come
713   *with such (more then impudent) sawcines from you, can
714   *thrust me from a leuell consideration, I know you #ha' pra-ctis'd
715    vpon the easie- yeelding spirit of this woman.
716    <S {Host}.> Yes in troth my Lord.
717   *<S {Iust}.> Prethee peace: pay her the debt you owe her, and
718   *vnpay the villany you haue done her: the one you may do
719   *with sterling mony, & the other with currant repentance.
720   *<S {Fal}.> My Lord, I will not vndergo this sneape without
721   *reply. You call honorable Boldnes, impudent Sawcinesse:
722   *If a man wil curt'sie, and say nothing, he is vertuous: No,
723   *my Lord (your humble duty reme[m]bred) I will not be your
724   *sutor. I say to you, I desire deliu'rance from these Officers
725    being vpon hasty employment in the Kings Affaires.
726   *<S {Iust}.> You speake, as hauing power to do wrong: But
727   *answer in the effect of your Reputation, and satisfie the
728    poore woman.
729    <S {Falst}.> Come hither Hostesse.  <D {Enter M[aster]. Gower}>
730    <S {Ch.Iust}.> Now Master {Gower}; What newes?
731   *<S {Gow}.> The King (my Lord) and {Henrie} Prince of Wales
732    Are neere at hand: The rest the Paper telles.
733    <S {Falst}.> As I am a Gentleman.
734    <S {Host}.> Nay, you said so before.
735   *<S {Fal}.> As I am a Gentleman. Come, no more words of it
736   *<S {Host}.> By this Heauenly ground I tread on, I must be
737   *faine to pawne both my Plate, and the Tapistry of my dy-ning
738    Chambers.
      <P g3v>
739   *<S {Fal}.> Glasses, glasses, is the onely drinking: and for
740   *thy walles a pretty slight Drollery, or the Storie of the
741   *Prodigall, or the Germane hunting in Waterworke, is
742   *worth a thousand of these Bed- hangings, and these Fly-bitten
743   *Tapistries. Let it be tenne pound (if thou canst.)
744   *Come, if it were not for thy humors, there is not a better
745   *Wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw thy
746   *Action: Come, thou must not bee in this humour with
747    me, come, I know thou was't set on to this.
748   *<S {Host}.> Prethee (Sir {Iohn}) let it be but twenty Nobles,
749    I loath to pawne my Plate, in good earnest la.
750   *<S {Fal}.> Let it alone, Ile make other shift: you'l be a fool
751    still.
752   *<S {Host}.> Well, you shall haue it although I pawne my
753   *Gowne. I hope you'l come to Supper: You'l pay me al-together?
754   _
755   *<S {Fal}.> Will I liue? Go with her, with her: hooke- on,
756    hooke- on.
757   *<S {Host}.> Will you haue {Doll Teare- sheet} meet you at sup-per?
758   _
759    <S {Fal}.> No more words. Let's haue her.
760    <S {Ch.Iust}.> I haue heard bitter newes.
761    <S {Fal}.> What's the newes (my good Lord?)
762    <S {Ch.Iu}.> Where lay the King last night?
763    <S {Mes}.> At Basingstoke my Lord.
764   *<S {Fal}.> I hope (my Lord) all's well. What is the newes
765    my Lord?
766    <S {Ch.Iust}.> Come all his Forces backe?
767   *<S {Mes}.> No: Fifteene hundred Foot, fiue hundred Horse
768    Are march'd vp to my Lord of Lancaster,
769    Against Northumberland, and the Archbishop.
770   *<S {Fal}.> Comes the King backe from Wales, my noble L[ord]?
771    <S {Ch.Iust}.> You shall haue Letters of me presently.
772    Come, go along with me, good M[aster]. {Gowre}.
773    <S {Fal}.> My Lord.
774    <S {Ch.Iust}.> What's the matter?
775   *<S {Fal}.> Master {Gowre}, shall I entreate you with mee to
776    dinner?
777    <S {Gow}.> I must waite vpon my good Lord heere.
778    I thanke you, good Sir {Iohn}.
779   *<S {Ch.Iust}.> Sir {Iohn}, you loyter heere too long being you
780    are to take Souldiers vp, in Countries as you go.
781    <S {Fal}.> Will you sup with me, Master {Gowre}?
782   *<S {Ch.Iust}.> What foolish Master taught you these man-ners,
783    Sir {Iohn}?
784   *<S {Fal}.> Master {Gower}, if they become mee not, hee was a
785   *Foole that taught them mee. This is the right Fencing
786    grace (my Lord) tap for tap, and so part faire.
787   *<S {Ch.Iust}.> Now the Lord lighten thee, thou art a great
788    Foole.  <D {Exeunt}>
789    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
790    <D {Enter Prince Henry, Pointz, Bardolfe},
791    {and Page}.>
792    <S {Prin}.> Trust me, I am exceeding weary.
793   *<S {Poin}.> Is it come to that? I had thought wearines durst
794    not haue attach'd one of so high blood.
795   *<S {Prin}.> It doth me: though it discolours the complexion
796   *of my Greatnesse to acknowledge it. Doth it not shew
797    vildely in me, to desire small Beere?
798   *<S {Poin}.> Why, a Prince should not be so loosely studied,
799    as to remember so weake a Composition.
800   *<S {Prince}.> Belike then, my Appetite was not Princely
801   *got: for (in troth) I do now remember the poore Crea-ture,
802   *Small Beere. But indeede these humble considera-tions
803   *make me out of loue with my Greatnesse. What a
804   *disgrace is it to me, to remember thy name? Or to know
805   *thy face to morrow? Or to take note how many paire of
806   *Silk stockings y hast? (Viz. these, and those that were thy
807   *peach- colour'd ones:) Or to beare the Inuentorie of thy
808   *shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other, for vse. But
809   *that the Tennis- Court- keeper knowes better then I, for
810   *it is a low ebbe of Linnen with thee, when thou kept'st
811   *not Racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, be-cause
812   *the rest of thy Low Countries, haue made a shift to
813    eate vp thy Holland.
814   *<S {Poin}.> How #ill it followes, after you haue labour'd so
815   *hard, you should talke so idlely? Tell me how many good
816   *yong Princes would do so, their Fathers lying so sicke, as
817    yours is?
818    <S {Prin}.> Shall I tell thee one thing, {Pointz}?
819    <S {Poin}.> Yes: and let it be an excellent good thing.
820   *<S {Prin}.> It shall serue among wittes of no higher breed-ing
821    then thine.
822   *<S {Poin}.> Go to: I stand the push of your one thing, that
823    you'l tell.
824   *<S {Prin}.> Why, I tell thee, it is not meet, that I should be
825   *sad now my Father is sicke: albeit I could tell to thee (as
826   *to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend)
827    I could be sad, and sad indeed too.
828    <S {Poin}.> Very hardly, vpon such a subiect.
829   *<S {Prin}.> Thou think'st me as farre in the Diuels Booke, as
830   *thou, and {Falstaffe}, for obduracie and persistencie. Let the
831   *end try the man. But I tell thee, my hart bleeds inward-ly,
832   *that my Father is so sicke: and keeping such vild com-pany
833   *as thou art, hath in reason taken from me, all osten-tation
834    of sorrow.
835    <S {Poin}.> The reason?
836   *<S {Prin}.> What would'st thou think of me, if I shold weep?
837    <S {Poin}.> I would thinke thee a most Princely hypocrite.
838   *<S {Prin}.> It would be euery mans thought: and thou art
839   *a blessed Fellow, to thinke as euery man thinkes: neuer a
840   *mans thought in the world, keepes the Rode- way better
841   *then thine: euery man would thinke me an Hypocrite in-deede.
842   *And what accites your most worshipful thought
843    to thinke so?
844   *<S {Poin}.> Why, because you haue beene so lewde, and so
845    much ingraffed to {Falstaffe}.
846    <S {Prin}.> And to thee.
847   *<S {Pointz}.> Nay, I am well spoken of, I can heare it with
848   *mine owne eares: the worst that they can say of me is, that
849   *I am a second Brother, and that I am a proper Fellowe of
850   *my hands: and those two things I confesse I canot helpe.
851    Looke, looke, here comes {Bardolfe}.
852   *<S {Prince}.> And the Boy that I gaue {Falstaffe}, he had him
853   *from me Christian, and see if the fat villain haue not trans-form'd
854    him Ape.
855    <D {Enter Bardolfe}.>
856    <S {Bar}.> Saue your Grace.
857    <S {Prin}.> And yours, most Noble {Bardolfe}.
858   *<S {Poin}.> Come you pernitious Asse, you bashfull Foole,
859   *must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? what
860   *a Maidenly man at Armes are you become? Is it such a
861    matter to get a Pottle- pots Maiden- head?
862   *<S {Page}.> He call'd me euen now (my Lord) through a red
863   *Lattice, and I could discerne no part of his face from the
      <P g4>
864   *window: at last I spy'd his eyes, and me thought he had
865   *made two holes in the Ale- wiues new Petticoat, & pee-ped
866    through.
867    <S {Prin}.> Hath not the boy profited?
868    <S {Bar}.> Away, you horson vpright Rabbet, away.
869    <S {Page}.> Away, you rascally {Altheas} dreame, away.
870    <S {Prin}.> Instruct vs Boy: what dreame, Boy?
871   *<S {Page}.> Marry (my Lord) {Althea} dream'd, she was de-liuer'd
872   *of a Firebrand, and therefore I call him hir dream.
873    <S {Prince}.> A Crownes- worth of good Interpretation:
874    There it is, Boy.
875   *<S {Poin}.> O that this good Blossome could bee kept from
876    Cankers: Well, there is six pence to preserue thee.
877   *<S {Bard}.> If you do not make him be hang'd among you,
878    the gallowes shall be wrong'd.
879    <S {Prince}.> And how doth thy Master, {Bardolph}?
880   *<S {Bar}.> Well, my good Lord: he heard of your Graces
881    comming to Towne. There's a Letter for you.
882   *<S {Poin}.> Deliuer'd with good respect: And how doth the
883    Martlemas, your Master?
884    <S {Bard}.> In bodily health Sir.
885   *<S {Poin}.> Marry, the immortall part needes a Physitian:
886   *but that moues not him: though that bee sicke, it dyes
887    not.
888   *<S {Prince}.> I do allow this Wen to bee as familiar with
889   *me, as my dogge: and he holds his place, for looke you
890    he writes.
891   *<S {Poin}.> <D {Letter}.> {Iohn Falstaffe Knight}: (Euery man must
892   *know that, as oft as hee hath occasion to name himselfe:)
893   *Euen like those that are kinne to the King, for they neuer
894   *pricke their finger, but they say, there is som of the kings
895   *blood spilt. How comes that (sayes he) that takes vpon
896   *him not to conceiue? the answer is as ready as a borrow-ed
897    cap: I am the Kings poore Cosin, Sir.
898   *<S {Prince}.> Nay, they will be kin to vs, but they wil fetch
899   *it from {Iaphet}. But to the Letter: === {Sir Iohn Falstaffe},
900   *{Knight, to the Sonne of the King, neerest his Father, Harrie}
901    {Prince of Wales, greeting}.
902    <S {Poin}.> Why this is a Certificate.
903    <S {Prin}.> Peace.
904    {I will imitate the honourable Romaines in breuitie}.
905   *<S {Poin}.> Sure he meanes breuity in breath: short- winded.
906   *{I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leaue thee. Bee}
907   *{not too familiar with} Pointz, {for hee misuses thy Fauours so}
908   *{much, that he sweares thou art to marrie his Sister} Nell. {Re-pent}
909    {at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell}.
910    {Thine, by yea and no: which is as much as to say, as thou}
911    {vsest him}. Iacke Falstaffe {with my Familiars}:
912    Iohn {with my Brothers and Sister: & Sir}
913    Iohn, {with all Europe}.
914   *My Lord, I will steepe this Letter in Sack, and make him
915    eate it.
916   *<S {Prin}.> That's to make him eate twenty of his Words.
917    But do you vse me thus {Ned}? Must I marry your Sister?
918   *<S {Poin}.> May the Wench haue no worse Fortune. But I
919    neuer said so.
920   *<S {Prin}.> Well, thus we play the Fooles with the time, &
921   *the spirits of the wise, sit in the clouds, and mocke vs: Is
922    your Master heere in London?
923    <S {Bard}.> Yes my Lord.
924   *<S {Prin}.> Where suppes he? Doth the old Bore, feede in
925    the old Franke?
926    <S {Bard}.> At the old place my Lord, in East- cheape.
927    <S {Prin}.> What Company?
928    <S {Page}.> Ephesians my Lord, of the old Church.
929    <S {Prin}.> Sup any women with him?
930   *<S {Page}.> None my Lord, but old Mistris {Quickly}, and M[istris].
931    {Doll Teare- sheet}.
932    <S {Prin}.> What Pagan may that be?
933   *<S {Page}.> A proper Gentlewoman, Sir, and a Kinswoman
934    of my Masters.
935   *<S {Prin}.> Euen such Kin, as the Parish Heyfors are to the
936    Towne- Bull?
937    Shall we steale vpon them ({Ned}) at Supper?
938    <S {Poin}.> I am your shadow, my Lord, Ile follow you.
939   *<S {Prin}.> Sirrah, you boy, and {Bardolph}, no word to your
940    Master that I am yet in Towne.
941    There's for your silence.
942    <S {Bar}.> I haue no tongue, sir.
943    <S {Page}.> And for mine Sir, I will gouerne it.
944    <S {Prin}.> Fare ye well: go.
945    This {Doll Teare- sheet} should be some Rode.
946   *<S {Poin}.> I warrant you, as common as the way betweene
947    S[aint]. Albans, and London.
948   *<S {Prin}.> How might we see {Falstaffe} bestow himselfe to
949    night, in his true colours, and not our selues be seene?
950   *<S {Poin}.> Put on two Leather Ierkins, and Aprons, and
951    waite vpon him at his Table, like Drawers.
952   *<S {Prin}.> From a God, to a Bull? A heauie declension: It
953   *was Ioues case. From a Prince, to a Prentice, a low trans-formation,
954   *that shall be mine: for in euery thing, the pur-pose
955    must weigh with the folly. Follow me {Ned}.  <D {Exeunt}>
956    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
957    <D {Enter Northumberland, his Ladie, and Harrie}
958    {Percies Ladie}.>
959    <S {North}.> I prethee louing Wife, and gentle Daughter,
960    Giue an euen way vnto my rough Affaires:
961    Put not you on the visage of the Times,
962    And be like them to Percie, troublesome.
963    <S {Wife}.> I haue giuen ouer, I will speak no more,
964    Do what you will: your Wisedome, be your guide.
965    <S {North}.> Alas (sweet Wife) my Honor is at pawne,
966    And but my going, nothing can redeeme it.
967   *<S {La}.> Oh yet, for heauens sake, go not to these Warrs;
968    The Time was (Father) when you broke your word,
969    When you were more endeer'd to it, then now,
970    When your owne Percy, when my heart- deere-{#Harry},
971    Threw many a Northward looke, to see his Father
972    Bring vp his Powres: but he did long in vaine.
973    Who then perswaded you to stay at home?
974    There were two Honors lost; Yours, and your Sonnes.
975    For Yours, may heauenly glory brighten it:
976    For His, it stucke vpon him, as the Sunne
977    In the gray vault of Heauen: and by his Light
978    Did all the Cheualrie of England moue
979    To do braue Acts. He was (indeed) the Glasse
980    Wherein the Noble- Youth did dresse themselues.
981    He had no Legges, that practic'd not his Gate:
982    And speaking thicke (which Nature made his blemish)
983    Became the Accents of the Valiant.
984    For those that could speake low, and tardily,
985    Would turne their owne Perfection, to Abuse,
986    To seeme like him. So that in Speech, in Gate,
987    In Diet, in Affections of delight,
988    In Militarie Rules, Humors of Blood,
      <P g4v><C H>
989    He was the Marke, and Glasse, Coppy, and Booke,
990    That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous! him,
991    O Miracle of Men! Him did you leaue
992    (Second to none) vn- seconded by you,
993    To looke vpon the hideous God of Warre,
994    In dis- aduantage, to abide a field,
995    Where nothing but the sound of {Hotspurs} Name
996    Did seeme defensible: so you left him.
997    Neuer, O neuer doe his Ghost the wrong,
998    To hold your Honor more precise and nice
999    With others, then with him. Let them alone:
1000   The Marshall and the Arch- bishop are strong.
1001   Had my sweet {Harry} had but halfe their Numbers,
1002   To day might I (hanging on {Hotspurs} Necke)
1003   Haue talk'd of {Monmouth's} Graue.
1004   <S {North}.> Beshrew your heart,
1005   (Faire Daughter) you doe draw my Spirits from me,
1006   With new lamenting ancient Ouer- sights.
1007   But I must goe, and meet with Danger there,
1008   Or it will seeke me in another place,
1009   And finde me worse prouided.
1010   <S {Wife}.> O flye to Scotland,
1011   Till that the Nobles, and the armed Commons,
1012   Haue of their Puissance made a little taste.
1013   <S {Lady}.> If they get ground, and vantage of the King,
1014   Then ioyne you with them, like a Ribbe of Steele,
1015   To make Strength stronger. But, for all our loues,
1016   First let them trye themselues. So did your Sonne,
1017   He was so suffer'd; so came I a Widow:
1018   And neuer shall haue length of Life enough,
1019   To raine vpon Remembrance with mine Eyes,
1020   That it may grow, and sprowt, as high as Heauen,
1021   For Recordation to my Noble Husband.
1022  *<S {North}.> Come, come, go in with me: 'tis with my Minde
1023   As with the Tyde, swell'd vp vnto his height,
1024   That makes a still- stand, running neyther way.
1025   Faine would I goe to meet the Arch- bishop,
1026   But many thousand Reasons hold me backe.
1027   I will resolue for Scotland: there am I,
1028   Till Time and Vantage craue my company.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1029   <Z {Scaena Quarta}.>
1030   <D {Enter two Drawers}.>
1031  *<S 1.{Drawer}.> What hast thou brought there? Apple- Iohns?
1032  *Thou know'st Sir {Iohn} cannot endure an Apple- Iohn.
1033  _
1034  *<S 2.{Draw}.> Thou say'st true: the Prince once set a Dish
1035  *of Apple- Iohns before him, and told him there were fiue
1036  *more Sir {Iohns}: and, putting off  his Hat, said, I will now
1037  *take my leaue of these sixe drie, round, old- wither'd
1038  *Knights. It anger'd him to the heart: but hee hath for-got
1039   that.
1040  *<S 1.{Draw}.> Why then couer, and set them downe: and
1041  *see if thou canst finde out {Sneakes} Noyse; Mistris {Teare- sheet}
1042   would faine haue some Musique.
1043  *<S 2.{Draw}.> Sirrha, heere will be the Prince, and Master
1044  *{Points}, anon: and they will put on two of our Ierkins,
1045  *and Aprons, and Sir {Iohn} must not know of it: {Bardolph}
1046   hath brought word.
1047  *<S 1.{Draw}.> Then here will be old {Vtis}: it will be an ex-cellent
1048   stratagem.
1049   <S 2.{Draw}.> Ile see if I can finde out {Sneake}.  <D {Exit}.>
1050   <D {Enter Hostesse, and Dol}.>
1051  *<S {Host}.> Sweet- heart, me thinkes now you are in an ex-cellent
1052  *good temperalitie: your Pulsidge beates as ex-traordinarily,
1053  *as heart would desire; and your Colour
1054  *(I warrant you) is as red as any Rose: But you haue
1055  *drunke too much Canaries, and that's a maruellous sear-ching
1056  *Wine; and it perfumes the blood, ere wee can say
1057   what's this. How doe you now?
1058   <S {Dol}.> Better then I was: Hem.
1059  *<S {Host}.> Why that was well said: A good heart's worth
1060   Gold. Looke, here comes Sir {Iohn}.
1061   <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
1062  *<S {Falst}.> {When Arthur first in Court} === (emptie the Iordan)
1063   {and was a worthy King}: How now Mistris {Dol}?
1064   <S {Host}.> Sick of a Calme: yea, good- sooth.
1065  *<S {Falst}.> So is all her Sect: if they be once in a Calme,
1066   they are sick.
1067  *<S {Dol}.> You muddie Rascall, is that all the comfort you
1068   giue me?
1069   <S {Falst}.> You make fat Rascalls, Mistris {Dol}.
1070  *<S {Dol}.> I make them? Gluttonie and Diseases make
1071   them, I make them not.
1072  *<S {Falst}.> If the Cooke make the Gluttonie, you helpe to
1073  *make the Diseases ({Dol}) we catch of you ({Dol}) we catch
1074   of you: Grant that, my poore Vertue, grant that.
1075   <S {Dol}.> #I marry, our Chaynes, and our Iewels.
1076  *<S {Falst}.> Your Brooches, Pearles, and Owches: For to
1077  *serue brauely, is to come halting off: you know, to come
1078  *off the Breach, with his Pike bent brauely, and to Surge-rie
1079  *brauely; to venture vpon the charg'd- Chambers
1080   brauely.
1081  *<S {Host}.> Why this is the olde fashion: you two neuer
1082  *meete, but you fall to some discord: you are both (in
1083  *good troth) as Rheumatike as two drie Tostes, you can-not
1084  *one beare with anothers Confirmities. What the
1085  *good- yere? One must beare, and that must bee you:
1086  *you are the weaker Vessell; as they say, the emptier
1087   Vessell.
1088  *<S {Dol}.> Can a weake emptie Vessell beare such a huge
1089  *full Hogs- head? There's a whole Marchants Venture
1090  *of Burdeux- Stuffe in him: you haue not seene a Hulke
1091  *better stufft in the Hold. Come, Ile be friends with thee
1092  *{Iacke}: Thou art going to the Warres, and whether I
1093  *shall euer see thee againe, or no, there is no body
1094   cares.
1095   <D {Enter Drawer}.>
1096  *<S {Drawer}.> Sir, Ancient {Pistoll} is below, and would
1097   speake with you.
1098  *<S {Dol}.> Hang him, swaggering Rascall, let him not
1099  *come hither: it is the foule- mouth'dst  Rogue in Eng-land.
1100  _
1101  *<S {Host}.> If hee swagger, let him not come here: I must
1102  *liue amongst my Neighbors, Ile no Swaggerers: I am
1103  *in good name, and fame, with the very best: shut the
1104  *doore, there comes no Swaggerers heere: I haue not
1105  *liu'd all this while, to haue swaggering now: shut the
1106   doore, I pray you.
1107   <S {Falst}.> Do'st thou heare, Hostesse?
1108  *<S {Host}.> 'Pray you pacifie your selfe (Sir {Iohn}) there comes
1109   no Swaggerers heere.
      <P g5>
1110   <S {Falst}.> Do'st thou heare? it is mine Ancient.
1111  *<S {Host}.> Tilly- fally (Sir {Iohn}) neuer tell me, your ancient
1112  *Swaggerer comes not in my doores. I was before Master
1113  *{Tisick} the Deputie, the other day: and as hee said to me,
1114  *it was no longer agoe then Wednesday last: Neighbour
1115  *{Quickly} (sayes hee;) Master {Dombe}, our Minister, was by
1116  *then: Neighbour {Quickly} (sayes hee) receiue those that
1117  *are Ciuill; for (sayth hee) you are in an #ill Name: now
1118  *hee said so, I can tell whereupon: for (sayes hee) you are
1119  *an honest Woman, and well thought on; therefore take
1120  *heede what Guests you receiue: Receiue (sayes hee) no
1121  *swaggering Companions. There comes none heere. You
1122  *would blesse you to heare what hee said. No, Ile no
1123   Swaggerers.
1124  *<S {Falst}.> Hee's no Swaggerer (Hostesse:) a tame Cheater,
1125  *hee: you may stroake him as gently, as a Puppie Grey-hound:
1126  *hee will not swagger with a Barbarie Henne, if
1127  *her feathers turne backe in any shew of resistance. Call
1128   him vp (Drawer.)
1129  *<S {Host}.> Cheater, call you him? I will barre no honest
1130  *man my house, nor no Cheater: but I doe not loue swag-gering;
1131  *I am the worse when one sayes, swagger: Feele
1132   Masters, how I shake: looke you, I warrant you.
1133   <S {Dol}.> So you doe, Hostesse.
1134  *<S {Host}.> Doe I? yea, in very truth doe I, if it were an As-pen
1135   Leafe: I cannot abide Swaggerers.
1136   <D {Enter Pistol, and Bardolph and his Boy}.>
1137   <S {Pist}.> 'Saue you, Sir {Iohn}.
1138  *<S {Falst}.> Welcome Ancient {Pistol}. Here ({Pistol}) I charge
1139  *you with a Cup of Sacke: doe you discharge vpon mine
1140   Hostesse.
1141  *<S {Pist}.> I will discharge vpon her (Sir {Iohn}) with two
1142   Bullets.
1143  *<S {Falst}.> She is Pistoll- proofe (Sir) you shall hardly of-fend
1144   her.
1145  *<S {Host}.> Come, Ile drinke no Proofes, nor no Bullets: I
1146  *will drinke no more then will doe me good, for no mans
1147   pleasure, I.
1148  *<S {Pist}.> Then to you (Mistris {Dorothie}) I will charge
1149   you.
1150  *<S {Dol}.> Charge me? I scorne you (scuruie Companion)
1151  *what? you poore, base, rascally, cheating, lacke- Linnen- Mate:
1152  *away you mouldie Rogue, away; I am meat for
1153   your Master.
1154   <S {Pist}.> I know you, Mistris {Dorothie}.
1155  *<S {Dol}.> Away you Cut- purse Rascall, you filthy Bung,
1156  *away: By this Wine, Ile thrust my Knife in your mouldie
1157  *Chappes, if you play the sawcie Cuttle with me. Away
1158  *you Bottle- Ale Rascall, you Basket- hilt stale Iugler, you.
1159  *Since when, I pray you, Sir? what, with two Points on
1160   your shoulder? much.
1161   <S {Pist}.> I will murther your Ruffe, for this.
1162  *<S {Host}.> No, good Captaine {Pistol}: not heere, sweete
1163   Captaine.
1164  *<S {Dol}.> Captaine? thou abhominable damn'd Cheater,
1165  *art thou not asham'd to be call'd Captaine? If Captaines
1166  *were of my minde, they would trunchion you out, for ta-king
1167  *their Names vpon you, before you haue earn'd them.
1168  *You a Captaine? you slaue, for what? for tearing a poore
1169  *Whores Ruffe in a Bawdy- house? Hee a Captaine? hang
1170  *him Rogue, hee liues vpon mouldie stew'd- Pruines, and
1171  *dry'de  Cakes. A Captaine? These Villaines will make
1172  *the word Captaine odious: Therefore Captaines had
1173   neede looke to it.
1174   <S {Bard}.> 'Pray thee goe downe, good Ancient.
1175   <S {Falst}.> Hearke thee hither, Mistris {Dol}.
1176  *<S {Pist}.> Not I: I tell thee what, Corporall {Bardolph}, I
1177   could teare her: Ile be reueng'd on her.
1178   <S {Page}.> 'Pray thee goe downe.
1179  *<S {Pist}.> Ile see her damn'd first: to {Pluto's} damn'd Lake,
1180  *to the Infernall Deepe, where {Erebus} and Tortures vilde
1181  *also. Hold Hooke and Line, say I: Downe: downe
1182   Dogges, downe Fates: haue wee not {Hiren} here?
1183  *<S {Host}.> Good Captaine {Peesel} be quiet, it is very late:
1184   I beseeke you now, aggrauate your Choler.
1185  *<S {Pist}.> These be good Humors indeede. Shall Pack-Horses,
1186  *and hollow- pamper'd Iades of Asia, which can-not
1187  *goe but thirtie miles a day, compare with {Caesar}, and
1188  *with Caniballs, and Troian Greekes? nay, rather damne
1189  *them with King {Cerberus}, and let the Welkin roare: shall
1190   wee fall foule for Toyes?
1191  *<S {Host}.> By my troth Captaine, these are very bitter
1192   words.
1193  *<S {Bard}.> Be gone, good Ancient: this will grow to a
1194   Brawle anon.
1195  *<S {Pist}.> Die men, like Dogges; giue Crownes like Pinnes:
1196   Haue we not {Hiren} here?
1197  *<S {Host}.> On my word (Captaine) there's none such here.
1198  *What the good- yere, doe you thinke I would denye her?
1199   I pray be quiet.
1200  *<S {Pist}.> Then feed, and be fat (my faire {Calipolis}.) Come,
1201  *giue me some Sack, {Si fortune me tormente, sperato me con-tente}.
1202  *Feare wee broad- sides? No, let the Fiend giue fire:
1203  *Giue me some Sack: and Sweet- heart lye thou there:
1204  *Come wee to full Points here, and are {et cetera's} no-thing?
1205  _
1206   <S {Fal}.> {Pistol}, I would be quiet.
1207  *<S {Pist}.> Sweet Knight, I kisse thy Neaffe: what? wee haue
1208   seene the seuen Starres.
1209  *<S {Dol}.> Thrust him downe stayres, I cannot endure such
1210   a Fustian Rascall.
1211  *<S {Pist}.> Thrust him downe stayres? know we not Gallo-way
1212   Nagges?
1213  *<S {Fal}.> Quoit him downe ({Bardolph}) like a shoue- groat
1214  *shilling: nay, if hee doe nothing but speake nothing, hee
1215   shall be nothing here.
1216   <S {Bard}.> Come, get you downe stayres.
1217  *<S {Pist}.> What? shall wee haue Incision? shall wee em-brew?
1218  *then Death rocke me asleepe, abridge my dolefull
1219  *dayes: why then let grieuous, gastly, gaping Wounds,
1220   vntwin'd the Sisters three: Come {Atropos}, I say.
1221   <S {Host}.> Here's good stuffe toward.
1222   <S {Fal}.> Giue me my Rapier, Boy.
1223   <S {Dol}.> I prethee {Iack}, I prethee doe not draw.
1224   <S {Fal}.> Get you downe stayres.
1225  *<S {Host}.> Here's a goodly tumult: Ile forsweare keeping
1226  *house, before Ile be in these tirrits, and frights. So: Mur-ther
1227  *I warrant now. Alas, alas, put vp your naked Wea-pons,
1228   put vp your naked Weapons.
1229  *<S {Dol}.> I prethee {Iack} be quiet, the Rascall is gone: ah,
1230   you whorson little valiant Villaine, you.
1231  *<S {Host}.> Are you not hurt i'th' Groyne? me thought hee
1232   made a shrewd Thrust at your Belly.
1233   <S {Fal}.> Haue you turn'd him out of doores?
1234  *<S {Bard}.> Yes Sir: the Rascall's drunke: you haue hurt
1235   him (Sir) in the shoulder.
1236   <S {Fal}.> A Rascall to braue me.
1237  *<S {Dol}.> Ah, you sweet little Rogue, you: alas, poore Ape,
1238  *how thou sweat'st? Come, let me wipe thy Face: Come
1239  *on, you whorson Chops: Ah Rogue, I loue thee: Thou
      <P g5v>
1240  *art as valorous as {Hector} of Troy, worth fiue of {Agamem-non},
1241  *and tenne times better then the nine Worthies: ah
1242   Villaine.
1243  *<S {Fal}.> A rascally Slaue, I will tosse the Rogue in a Blan-ket.
1244  _
1245  *<S {Dol}.> Doe, if thou dar'st for thy heart: if thou doo'st,
1246   Ile canuas thee betweene a paire of Sheetes.
1247   <D {Enter Musique}.>
1248   <S {Page}.> The Musique is come, Sir.
1249  *<S {Fal}.> Let them play: play Sirs. Sit on my Knee, {Dol}.
1250  *A Rascall, bragging Slaue: the Rogue fled from me like
1251   Quick- siluer.
1252  *<S {Dol}.> And thou followd'st him like a Church: thou
1253  *whorson little tydie Bartholmew Bore- pigge, when wilt
1254  *thou leaue fighting on dayes, and foyning on nights, and
1255   begin to patch vp thine old Body for Heauen?
1256   <D {Enter the Prince and Poines disguis'd}.>
1257  *<S {Fal}.> Peace (good {Dol}) doe not speake like a Deaths-head:
1258   doe not bid me remember mine end.
1259   <S {Dol}.> Sirrha, what humor is the Prince of?
1260  *<S {Fal}.> A good shallow young fellow: hee would haue
1261  *made a good Pantler, hee would haue chipp'd Bread
1262   well.
1263   <S {Dol}.> They say {Poines} hath a good Wit.
1264  *<S {Fal}.> Hee a good Wit? hang him Baboone, his Wit is
1265  *as thicke as Tewksburie Mustard: there is no more con-ceit
1266   in him, then is in a Mallet.
1267   <S {Dol}.> Why doth the Prince loue him so then?
1268  *<S {Fal}.> Because their Legges are both of a bignesse: and
1269  *hee playes at Quoits well, and eates Conger and Fennell,
1270  *and drinkes off Candles ends for Flap- dragons, and rides
1271  *the wilde- Mare with the Boyes, and iumpes vpon Ioyn'd-stooles,
1272  *and sweares with a good grace, and weares his
1273  *Boot very smooth, like vnto the Signe of the Legge; and
1274  *breedes no bate with telling of discreete stories: and such
1275  *other Gamboll Faculties hee hath, that shew a weake
1276  *Minde, and an able Body, for the which the Prince admits
1277  *him; for the Prince himselfe is such another: the
1278  *weight of an hayre will turne the Scales betweene their
1279   {Haber-de-pois}.
1280  *<S {Prince}.> Would not this Naue of a Wheele haue his
1281   Eares cut off?
1282   <S {Poin}.> Let vs beat him before his Whore.
1283  *<S {Prince}.> Looke, if the wither'd Elder hath not his Poll
1284   claw'd like a Parrot.
1285  *<S {Poin}.> Is it not strange, that Desire should so many
1286   yeeres out- liue performance?
1287   <S {Fal}.> Kisse me {Dol}.
1288  *<S {Prince}.> {Saturne} and {Venus} this yeere in Coniunction?
1289   What sayes the Almanack to that?
1290  *<S {Poin}.> And looke whether the fierie {Trigon}, his Man,
1291  *be not lisping to his Masters old Tables, his Note- Booke,
1292   his Councell- keeper?
1293   <S {Fal}.> Thou do'st giue me flatt'ring Busses.
1294  *<S {Dol}.> Nay truely, I kisse thee with a most constant
1295   heart.
1296   <S {Fal}.> I am olde, I am olde.
1297  *<S {Dol}.> I loue thee better, then I loue ere a scuruie young
1298   Boy of them all.
1299  *<S {Fal}.> What Stuffe wilt thou haue a Kirtle of? I shall
1300  *receiue Money on Thursday: thou shalt haue a Cappe
1301  *to morrow. A merrie Song, come: it growes late,
1302  *wee will to Bed. Thou wilt forget me, when I am
1303   gone.
1304  *<S {Dol}.> Thou wilt set me #a weeping, if thou say'st so:
1305  *proue that euer I dresse my selfe handsome, till thy re-turne:
1306   well, hearken the end.
1307   <S {Fal}.> Some Sack, {Francis}.
1308   <S {Prin}. {Poin}.> Anon, anon, Sir.
1309  *<S {Fal}.> Ha? a Bastard Sonne of the Kings? And art not
1310   thou {Poines}, his Brother?
1311  *<S {Prince}.> Why thou Globe of sinfull Continents, what
1312   a life do'st thou lead?
1313  *<S {Fal}.> A better then thou: I am a Gentleman, thou art
1314   a Drawer.
1315  *<S {Prince}.> Very true, Sir: and I come to draw you out
1316   by the Eares.
1317  *<S {Host}.> Oh, the Lord preserue thy good Grace: Wel-come
1318  *to London. Now Heauen blesse that sweete Face
1319   of thine: what, are you come from Wales?
1320  *<S {Fal}.> Thou whorson mad Compound of Maiestie: by
1321   this light Flesh, and corrupt Blood, thou art welcome.
1322   <S {Dol}.> How? you fat Foole, I scorne you.
1323  *<S {Poin}.> My Lord, hee will driue you out of your re-uenge,
1324  *and turne all to a merryment, if you take not the
1325   heat.
1326  *<S {Prince}.> You whorson Candle- myne you, how vildly
1327  *did you speake of me euen now, before this honest, ver-tuous,
1328   ciuill Gentlewoman?
1329  *<S {Host}.> 'Blessing on your good heart, and so shee is by
1330   my troth.
1331   <S {Fal}.> Didst thou heare me?
1332  *<S {Prince}.> Yes: and you knew me, as you did when you
1333  *ranne away by Gads- hill: you knew I was at your back,
1334   and spoke it on purpose, to trie my patience.
1335  *<S {Fal}.> No, no, no: not so: I did not thinke, thou wast
1336   within hearing.
1337  *<S {Prince}.> I shall driue you then to confesse the wilfull
1338   abuse, and then I know how to handle you.
1339   <S {Fal}.> No abuse ({Hall}) on mine Honor, no abuse.
1340  *<S {Prince}.> Not to disprayse me? and call me Pantler, and
1341   Bread- chopper, and I know not what?
1342   <S {Fal}.> No abuse ({Hal}.)
1343   <S {Poin}.> No abuse?
1344  *<S {Fal}.> No abuse ({Ned}) in the World: honest {Ned} none.
1345  *I disprays'd him before the Wicked, that the Wicked
1346  *might not fall in loue with him: In which doing, I haue
1347  *done the part of a carefull Friend, and a true Subiect, and
1348  *thy Father is to giue me thankes for it. No abuse ({Hal}:)
1349   none ({Ned}) none; no Boyes, none.
1350  *<S {Prince}.> See now whether pure Feare, and entire Cow-ardise,
1351  *doth not make thee wrong this vertuous Gentle-woman,
1352  *to close with vs? Is shee of the Wicked? Is thine
1353  *Hostesse heere, of the Wicked? Or is the Boy of the
1354  *Wicked? Or honest {Bardolph} (whose Zeale burnes in his
1355   Nose) of the Wicked?
1356   <S {Poin}.> Answere thou dead Elme, answere.
1357  *<S {Fal}.> The Fiend hath prickt downe {Bardolph} irrecoue-rable,
1358  *and his Face is {Lucifers} Priuy- Kitchin, where hee
1359  *doth nothing but rost Mault- Wormes: for the Boy,
1360  *there is a good Angell about him, but the Deuill out-bids
1361   him too.
1362   <S {Prince}.> For the Women?
1363  *<S {Fal}.> For one of them, shee is in #Hell alreadie, and
1364  *burnes poore Soules: for the other, I owe her Mo-ney;
1365  *and whether shee bee damn'd for that, I know
1366   not.
1367   <S {Host}.> No, I warrant you.
      <P g6>
1368  *<S {Fal}.> No, I thinke thou art not: I thinke thou art quit
1369  *for that. Marry, there is another Indictment vpon thee,
1370  *for suffering flesh to bee eaten in thy house, contrary to
1371   the Law, for the which I thinke thou wilt howle.
1372  *<S {Host}.> All Victuallers doe so: What is a Ioynt of
1373   Mutton, or two, in a whole Lent?
1374   <S {Prince}.> You, Gentlewoman.
1375   <S {Dol}.> What sayes your Grace?
1376  *<S {Falst}.> His Grace sayes that, which his flesh rebells
1377   against.
1378  *<S {Host}.> Who knocks so lowd at doore? Looke to the
1379   doore there, {Francis}?
1380   <D {Enter Peto}.>
1381   <S {Prince}.> {Peto}, how now? what newes?
1382   <S {Peto}.> The King, your Father, is at Westminster,
1383   And there are twentie weake and wearied Postes,
1384   Come from the North: and as I came along,
1385   I met, and ouer- tooke a dozen Captaines,
1386   Bare- headed, sweating, knocking at the Tauernes,
1387   And asking euery one for Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}.
1388  *<S {Prince}.> By Heauen ({Poines}) I feele me much to blame,
1389   So idly to prophane the precious time,
1390   When Tempest of Commotion, like the South,
1391   Borne with black Vapour, doth begin to melt,
1392   And drop vpon our bare vnarmed heads.
1393   Giue me my Sword, and Cloake:
1394   {Falstaffe}, good night. <D {Exit}.>
1395  *<S {Falst}.> Now comes in the sweetest Morsell of the
1396  *night, and wee must hence, and leaue it vnpickt. More
1397  *knocking at the doore? How now? what's the mat-ter?
1398  _
1399   <S {Bard}.> You must away to Court, Sir, presently,
1400   A dozen Captaines stay at doore for you.
1401  *<S {Falst}.> Pay the Musitians, Sirrha: farewell Hostesse,
1402  *farewell {Dol}. You see (my good Wenches) how men of

1407  *<S {Dol}.> I cannot speake: if my heart bee not readie

1409   selfe.
1410   <S {Falst}.> Farewell, farewell.  <D {Exit}.>
1411  *<S {Host}.> Well, fare thee well: I haue knowne thee
1412  *these twentie nine yeeres, come Pescod- time: but an

1414   well.
1415   <S {Bard}.> Mistris {Teare- sheet}.
1416   <S {Host}.> What's the matter?
1417   <S {Bard}.> Bid Mistris {Teare- sheet} come to my Master.

1419   <D {Exeunt}.>
1420   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1421   <D {Enter the King, with a Page}.>
1422  *<S {King}.> Goe, call the Earles of Surrey, and of Warwick:
1423   But ere they come, bid them ore- reade these Letters,
1424   And well consider of them: make good speed.  <D {Exit}.>
1425   How many thousand of my poorest Subiects
1426   Are at this howre asleepe? O Sleepe, O gentle Sleepe,
1427   Natures soft Nurse, how haue I frighted thee,
1428   That thou no more wilt weigh my eye- lids downe,
1429   And steepe my Sences in Forgetfulnesse?
1430   Why rather (Sleepe) lyest thou in smoakie Cribs,
1431   Vpon vneasie Pallads stretching thee,
1432   And huisht with bussing Night, flyes to thy slumber,
1433   Then in the perfum'd Chambers of the Great?
1434   Vnder the Canopies of costly State,
1435   And lull'd with sounds of sweetest Melodie?
1436   O thou dull God, why lyest thou with the vilde,
1437   In loathsome Beds, and leau'st the Kingly Couch,
1438   A Watch- case, or a common Larum- Bell?
1439   Wilt thou, vpon the high and giddie Mast,
1440   Seale vp the Ship- boyes Eyes, and rock his Braines,
1441   In Cradle of the rude imperious Surge,
1442   And in the visitation of the Windes,
1443   Who take the Ruffian Billowes by the top,
1444   Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
1445   With deaff'ning Clamors in the slipp'ry Clouds,
1446   That with the hurley, Death it selfe awakes?
1447   Canst thou (O partiall Sleepe) giue thy Repose
1448   To the wet Sea- Boy, in an houre so rude:
1449   And in the calmest, and most stillest Night,
1450   With all appliances, and meanes to boote,
1451   Deny it to a King? Then happy Lowe, lye downe,
1452   Vneasie lyes the Head, that weares a Crowne.
1453   <D {Enter Warwicke and Surrey}.>
1454   <S {War}.> Many good- morrowes to your Maiestie.
1455   <S {King}.> Is it good- morrow, Lords?
1456   <S {War}.> 'Tis One #a Clock, and past.
1457  *<S {King}.> Why then good- morrow to you all (my Lords:)
1458   Haue you read o're the Letters that I sent you?
1459   <S {War}.> We haue (my Liege.)
1460  *<S {King}.> Then you perceiue the Body of our Kingdome,
1461   How foule it is: what ranke Diseases grow,
1462   And with what danger, neere the Heart of it?
1463   <S {War}.> It is but as a Body, yet distemper'd,
1464   Which to his former strength may be restor'd,
1465   With good aduice, and little Medicine:
1466   My Lord {Northumberland} will soone be cool'd.
1467  *<S {King}.> Oh Heauen, that one might read the Book of Fate,
1468   And see the reuolution of the Times
1469   Make Mountaines leuell, and the Continent
1470   (Wearie of solide firmenesse) melt it selfe
1471   Into the Sea: and other Times, to see
1472   The beachie Girdle of the Ocean
1473   Too wide for {Neptunes} hippes; how Chances mocks
1474   And Changes fill the Cuppe of Alteration
1475   With diuers Liquors. 'Tis not tenne yeeres gone,
1476   Since {Richard}, and {Northumberland}, great friends,
1477   Did feast together; and in two yeeres after,
1478   Were they at Warres. It is but eight yeeres since,
1479   This {Percie} was the man, neerest my Soule,
1480   Who, like a Brother, toyl'd in my Affaires,
1481   And layd his Loue and Life vnder my foot:
1482   Yea, for my sake, euen to the eyes of {Richard}
1483   Gaue him defiance. But which of you was by
1484   (You Cousin {Neuil}, as I may remember)
1485   When {Richard}, with his Eye, brim- full of Teares,
1486   (Then check'd, and rated by {Northumberland})
1487   Did speake these words (now prou'd a Prophecie:)
1488   {Northumberland}, thou Ladder, by the which
      <P g6v>
1489   My Cousin {Bullingbrooke} ascends my Throne:
1490   (Though then, Heauen knowes, I had no such intent,
1491   But that necessitie so bow'd the State,
1492   That I and Greatnesse were compell'd to kisse:)
1493   The Time shall come (thus did hee follow it)
1494   The Time will come, that foule Sinne gathering head,
1495   Shall breake into Corruption: so went on,
1496   Fore- telling this same Times Condition,
1497   And the diuision of our Amitie.
1498   <S {War}.> There is a Historie in all mens Liues,
1499   Figuring the nature of the Times deceas'd:
1500   The which obseru'd, a man may prophecie
1501   With a neere ayme, of the maine chance of things,
1502   As yet not come to Life, which in their Seedes
1503   And weake beginnings lye entreasured:
1504   Such things become the Hatch and Brood of Time;
1505   And by the necessarie forme of this,
1506   King {Richard} might create a perfect guesse,
1507   That great {Northumberland}, then false to him,
1508   Would of that Seed, grow to a greater falsenesse,
1509   Which should not finde a ground to roote vpon,
1510   Vnlesse on you.
1511   <S {King}.> Are these things then Necessities?
1512   Then let vs meete them like Necessities;
1513   And that same word, euen now cryes out on vs:
1514   They say, the Bishop and {Northumberland}
1515   Are fiftie thousand strong.
1516   <S {War}.> It cannot be (my Lord:)
1517   Rumor doth double, like the Voice, and Eccho,
1518   The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace
1519   To goe to bed, vpon my Life (my Lord)
1520   The Pow'rs that you alreadie haue sent forth,
1521   Shall bring this Prize in very easily.
1522   To comfort you the more, I haue receiu'd
1523   A certaine instance, that {Glendour} is dead.
1524   Your Maiestie hath beene this fort- night #ill,
1525   And these vnseason'd howres perforce must adde
1526   Vnto your Sicknesse.
1527   <S {King}.> I will take your counsaile:
1528   And were these inward Warres once out of hand,
1529   Wee would (deare Lords) vnto the Holy- Land.
1530   <D {Exeunt}.>
1531   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1532   <D {Enter Shallow and Silence: with Mouldie, Shadow},
1533   {Wart, Feeble, Bull- calfe}.>
1534  *<S {Shal}.> Come- on, come- on, come- on: giue mee your
1535  *Hand, Sir; giue mee your Hand, Sir: an early stirrer, by
1536   the Rood. And how doth my good Cousin {Silence}?
1537   <S {Sil}.> Good- morrow, good Cousin {Shallow}.
1538  *<S {Shal}.> And how doth my Cousin, your Bed- fellow?
1539  *and your fairest Daughter, and mine, my God- Daughter
1540   {Ellen}?
1541   <S {Sil}.> Alas, a blacke Ouzell (Cousin {Shallow}.)
1542  *<S {Shal}.> By yea and nay, Sir. I dare say my Cousin {William}
1543  *is become a good Scholler? hee is at Oxford still, is hee
1544   not?
1545   <S {Sil}.> Indeede Sir, to my cost.
1546  *<S {Shal}.> Hee must then to the Innes of Court shortly: I
1547  *was once of {Clements} Inne; where (I thinke) they will
1548   talke of mad {Shallow} yet.
1549   <S {Sil}.> You were call'd lustie {Shallow} then (Cousin.)
1550  *<S {Shal}.> I was call'd any thing: and I would haue done
1551  *any thing indeede too, and roundly too. There was I, and
1552  *little {Iohn Doit} of Staffordshire, and blacke {George Bare},
1553  *and {Francis Pick- bone}, and {Will Squele} a Cot-sal- man, you
1554  *had not foure such Swindge- bucklers in all the Innes of
1555  *Court againe: And I may say to you, wee knew where
1556  *the {Bona- Roba's} were, and had the best of them all at
1557  *commandement. Then was {Iacke Falstaffe} (now Sir {Iohn})
1558  *a Boy, and Page to {Thomas Mowbray}, Duke of Nor-folke.
1559  _
1560  *<S {Sil}.> This Sir {Iohn} (Cousin) that comes hither anon a-bout
1561   Souldiers?
1562  *<S {Shal}.> The same Sir {Iohn}, the very same: I saw him
1563  *breake {Scoggan's} Head at the Court- Gate, when hee was
1564  *a Crack, not thus high: and the very same day did I fight
1565  *with one {Sampson Stock- fish}, a Fruiterer, behinde Greyes- Inne.
1566  *Oh the mad dayes that I haue spent! and to see
1567   how many of mine olde Acquaintance are dead?
1568   <S {Sil}.> Wee shall all follow (Cousin.)
1569  *<S {Shal}.> Certaine: 'tis certaine: very sure, very sure:
1570  *Death is certaine to all, all shall dye. How a good Yoke
1571   of Bullocks at Stamford Fayre?
1572   <S {Sil}.> Truly Cousin, I was not there.
1573  *<S {Shal}.> Death is certaine. Is old {Double} of your Towne
1574   liuing yet?
1575   <S {Sil}.> Dead, Sir.
1576  *<S {Shal}.> Dead? See, see: hee drew a good Bow: and
1577  *dead? hee shot a fine shoote. {Iohn} of Gaunt loued
1578  *him well, and betted much Money on his head. Dead?
1579  *hee would haue clapt in the Clowt at Twelue- score, and
1580  *carryed you a fore- hand Shaft at foureteene, and foure-teene
1581  *and a halfe, that it would haue done a mans heart
1582   good to see. How a score of Ewes now?
1583  *<S {Sil}.> Thereafter as they be: a score of good Ewes
1584   may be worth tenne pounds.
1585   <S {Shal}.> And is olde {Double} dead?
1586   <D {Enter Bardolph and his Boy}.>
1587  *<S {Sil}.> Heere come two of Sir {Iohn Falstaffes} Men (as I
1588   thinke.)
1589   <S {Shal}.> Good- morrow, honest Gentlemen.
1590   <S {Bard}.> I beseech you, which is Iustice {Shallow}?
1591  *<S {Shal}.> I am {Robert Shallow} (Sir) a poore Esquire of this
1592  *Countie, and one of the Kings Iustices of the Peace:
1593   What is your good pleasure with me?
1594  *<S {Bard}.> My Captaine (Sir) commends him to you:
1595  *my Captaine, Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}: a tall Gentleman, and a
1596   most gallant Leader.
1597  *<S {Shal}.> Hee greetes me well: (Sir) I knew him a
1598  *good Back- Sword- man. How doth the good Knight?
1599   may I aske, how my Lady his Wife doth?
1600  *<S {Bard}.> Sir, pardon: a Souldier is better accommoda-ted,
1601   then with a Wife.
1602  *<S {Shal}.> It is well said, Sir; and it is well said, indeede,
1603  *too: Better accommodated? it is good, yea indeede is
1604  *it: good phrases are surely, and euery where very com-mendable.
1605  *Accommodated, it comes of {Accommodo}:
1606   very good, a good Phrase.
1607  *<S {Bard}.> Pardon, Sir, I haue heard the word. Phrase
1608  *call you it? by this Day, I know not the Phrase: but
1609  *I will maintaine the Word with my Sword, to bee a
1610  *Souldier- like Word, and a Word of exceeding good
1611  *Command. Accommodated: that is, when a man is
1612  *(as they say) accommodated: or, when a man is, being
      <P Xgg1><C B>
1613  *whereby he thought to be accommodated, which is an
1614   excellent thing.
1615   <D {Enter Falstaffe}.>
1616  *<S {Shal}.> It is very iust: Looke, heere comes good Sir
1617  *{#Iohn}. Giue me your hand, giue me your Worships good
1618  *hand: Trust me, you looke well: and beare your yeares
1619   very well. Welcome, good Sir {Iohn}.
1620  *<S {Fal}.> I am glad to see you well, good M[aster]. {Robert Shal-low}:
1621   Master {Sure- card} as I thinke?
1622  *<S {Shal}.> No sir {Iohn}, it is my Cosin {Silence}: in Commissi-on
1623   with mee.
1624  *<S {Fal}.> Good M[aster]. {Silence}, it well befits you should be of
1625   the peace.
1626   <S {Sil}.> Your good Worship is welcome.
1627  *<S {Fal}.> Fye, this is hot weather (Gentlemen) haue you
1628   prouided me heere halfe a dozen of sufficient men?
1629   <S {Shal}.> Marry haue we sir: Will you sit?
1630   <S {Fal}.> Let me see them, I beseech you.
1631  *<S {Shal}.> Where's the Roll? Where's the Roll? Where's
1632  *the Roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see: so, so, so, so:
1633  *yea marry Sir. {Raphe Mouldie}: let them appeare as I call:
1634  *let them do so, let them do so: Let mee see, Where is
1635   {Mouldie}?
1636   <S {Moul}.> Heere, if it please you.
1637  *<S {Shal}.> What thinke you (Sir {Iohn}) a good limb'd fel-low:
1638   yong, strong, and of good friends.
1639   <S {Fal}.> Is thy name {Mouldie}?
1640   <S {Moul}.> Yea, if it please you.
1641   <S {Fal}.> 'Tis the more time thou wert vs'd.
1642  *<S {Shal}.> Ha, ha, ha, most excellent. Things that are moul-die,
1643  *lacke vse: very singular good. Well saide Sir {Iohn},
1644   very well said.
1645   <S {Fal}.> Pricke him.
1646  *<S {Moul}.> I was prickt well enough before, if you could
1647  *haue let me alone: my old Dame will be vndone now, for
1648  *one to doe her Husbandry, and her Drudgery; you need
1649  *not to haue prickt me, there are other men fitter to goe
1650   out, then I.
1651  *<S {Fal}.> Go #too: peace {Mouldie}, you shall goe. {Mouldie},
1652   it is time you were spent.
1653   <S {Moul}.> Spent?
1654  *<S {Shallow}.> Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: Know you
1655  *where you are? For the other sir {Iohn}: Let me see: {Simon}
1656   {Shadow}.
1657  *<S {Fal}.> #I marry, let me haue him to sit vnder: he's like to
1658   be a cold souldier.
1659   <S {Shal}.> Where's {Shadow}?
1660   <S {Shad}.> Heere sir.
1661   <S {Fal}.> {Shadow}, whose sonne art thou?
1662   <S {Shad}.> My Mothers sonne, Sir.
1663  *<S {Falst}.> Thy Mothers sonne: like enough, and thy Fa-thers
1664  *shadow: so the sonne of the Female, is the shadow
1665  *of the Male: it is often so indeede, but not of the Fathers
1666   substance.
1667   <S {Shal}.> Do you like him, sir {Iohn}?
1668  *<S {Falst}.> {Shadow} will serue for Summer: pricke him: For
1669  *wee haue a number of shadowes to fill vppe the Muster- Booke.
1670  _
1671   <S {Shal}.> {Thomas Wart}?
1672   <S {Falst}.> Where's he?
1673   <S {Wart}.> Heere sir.
1674   <S {Falst}.> Is thy name {Wart}?
1675   <S {Wart}.> Yea sir.
1676   <S {Fal}.> Thou art a very ragged Wart.
1677   <S {Shal}.> Shall I pricke him downe,
1678   Sir {Iohn}?
1679  *<S {Falst}.> It were superfluous: for his apparrel is built vp-on
1680  *his backe, and the whole frame stands vpon pins: prick
1681   him no more.
1682  *<S {Shal}.> Ha, ha, ha, you can do it sir: you can doe it: I
1683   commend you well.
1684   {Francis Feeble}.
1685   <S {Feeble}.> Heere sir.
1686   <S {Shal}.> What Trade art thou {Feeble}?
1687   <S {Feeble}.> A Womans Taylor sir.
1688   <S {Shal}.> Shall I pricke him, sir?
1689   <S {Fal}.> You may:
1690  *But if he had beene a mans Taylor, he would haue prick'd
1691  *you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemies Bat-taile,
1692   as thou hast done in a Womans petticote?
1693  *<S {Feeble}.> I will doe my good #will sir, you can haue no
1694   more.
1695  *<S {Falst}.> Well said, good Womans Tailour: Well sayde
1696  *Couragious {Feeble}: thou wilt bee as valiant as the wrath-full
1697  *Doue, or most magnanimous Mouse. Pricke the wo-mans
1698  *Taylour well Master {Shallow}, deepe Maister {Shal-low}.
1699  _
1700   <S {Feeble}.> I would {Wart} might haue gone sir.
1701  *<S {Fal}.> I would thou wert a mans Tailor, that y might'st
1702  *mend him, and make him fit to goe. I cannot put him to
1703  *a priuate souldier, that is the Leader of so many thou-sands.
1704   Let that suffice, most Forcible {Feeble}.
1705   <S {Feeble}.> It shall suffice.
1706  *<S {Falst}.> I am bound to thee, reuerend {Feeble}. Who is
1707   the next?
1708   <S {Shal}.> {Peter Bulcalfe} of the Greene.
1709   <S {Falst}.> Yea marry, let vs see {Bulcalfe}.
1710   <S {Bul}.> Heere sir.
1711  *<S {Fal}.> Trust me, a likely Fellow. Come, pricke me {Bul-calfe}
1712   till he roare againe.
1713   <S {Bul}.> Oh, good my Lord Captaine.
1714   <S {Fal}.> What? do'st thou roare before th'art prickt.
1715   <S {Bul}.> Oh sir, I am a diseased man.
1716   <S {Fal}.> What disease hast thou?
1717  *<S {Bul}.> A whorson cold sir, a cough sir, which I caught
1718  *with Ringing in the Kings affayres, vpon his Coronation
1719   day, sir.
1720  *<S {Fal}.> Come, thou shalt go to the Warres in a Gowne:
1721  *we will haue away thy Cold, and I will take such order,
1722   that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is heere all?
1723  *<S {Shal}.> There is two more called then your number:
1724  *you must haue but foure heere sir, and so I pray you go in
1725   with me to dinner.
1726  *<S {Fal}.> Come, I will goe drinke with you, but I cannot
1727  *tarry dinner. I am glad to see you in good troth, Master
1728   {Shallow}.
1729  *<S {Shal}.> O sir {Iohn}, doe you remember since wee lay all
1730   night in the Winde- mill, in S[aint]. Georges Field.
1731  *<S {Falstaffe}.> No more of that good Master {Shallow}: No
1732   more of that.
1733  *<S {Shal}.> Ha? it was a merry night. And is {Iane Night-worke}
1734   aliue?
1735   <S {Fal}.> She liues, M[aster]. {Shallow}.
1736   <S {Shal}.> She neuer could away with me.
1737  *<S {Fal}.> Neuer, neuer: she would alwayes say shee could
1738   not abide M[aster]. {Shallow}.
1739  *<S {Shal}.> I could anger her to the heart: shee was then a
1740   {Bona- Roba}. Doth she hold her owne well.
1741   <S {Fal}.> Old, old, M[aster]. {Shallow}.
1742  *<S {Shal}.> Nay, she must be old, she cannot choose but be
      <P Xgg1v><C H>
1743  *old: certaine shee's old: and had {Robin Night- worke}, by
1744   old {Night- worke}, before I came to {Clements} Inne.
1745   <S {Sil}.> That's fiftie fiue yeeres agoe.
1746  *<S {Shal}.> Hah, Cousin {Silence}, that thou hadst seene that,
1747  *that this Knight and I haue seene: hah, Sir {Iohn}, said I
1748   well?
1749  *<S {Falst}.> Wee haue heard the Chymes at mid- night, Ma-ster
1750   {Shallow}.
1751  *<S {Shal}.> That wee haue, that wee haue; in faith, Sir {Iohn},
1752  *wee haue: our watch- word was, Hem- Boyes. Come,

1755  *<S {Bul}.> Good Master Corporate {Bardolph}, stand my

1759  *but rather, because I am vnwilling, and for mine owne
1760  *part, haue a desire to stay with my friends: else, sir, I did
1761   not care, for mine owne part, so much.
1762   <S {Bard}.> Go- too: stand aside.
1763  *<S {Mould}.> And good Master Corporall Captaine, for my
1764  *old Dames sake, stand my friend: shee hath no body to
1765  *doe any thing about her, when I am gone: and she is old,
1766   and cannot helpe her selfe: you shall haue fortie, sir.
1767   <S {Bard}.> Go- too: stand aside.
1768  *<S {Feeble}.> I care not, a man can die but once: wee owe a
1769  *death. I will neuer beare a base minde: if it be my desti-nie,
1770  *so: if it be not, so: no man is too good to serue his
1771  *Prince: and let it goe which way it will, he that dies this
1772   yeere, is quit for the next.
1773   <S {Bard}.> Well said, thou art a good fellow.
1774   <S {Feeble}.> Nay, I will beare no base minde.
1775   <S {Falst}.> Come sir, which men shall I haue?
1776   <S {Shal}.> Foure of which you please.
1777  *<S {Bard}.> Sir, a word with you: I haue three pound, to
1778   free {Mouldie} and {Bull- calfe}.
1779   <S {Falst}.> Go- too: well.
1780   <S {Shal}.> Come, sir {Iohn}, which foure will you haue?
1781   <S {Falst}.> Doe you chuse for me.
1782  *<S {Shal}.> Marry then, {Mouldie}, {Bull- calfe}, {Feeble}, and
1783   {Shadow}.
1784  *<S {Falst}.> {Mouldie}, and {Bull- calfe}: for you {Mouldie}, stay
1785  *at home, till you are past seruice: and for your part, {Bull- calfe},
1786   grow till you come vnto it: I will none of you.
1787  *<S {Shal}.> Sir {Iohn}, Sir {Iohn}, doe not your selfe wrong, they
1788  *are your likelyest men, and I would haue you seru'd with
1789   the best.
1790  *<S {Falst}.> Will you tell me (Master {Shallow}) how to chuse
1791  *a man? Care I for the Limbe, the Thewes, the stature,
1792  *bulke, and bigge assemblance of a man? giue mee the
1793  *spirit (Master {Shallow}.) Where's {Wart}? you see what
1794  *a ragged appearance it is: hee shall charge you, and
1795  *discharge you, with the motion of a Pewterers Ham-mer:
1796  *come off, and on, swifter then hee that gibbets on
1797  *the Brewers Bucket. And this same halfe- fac'd fellow,
1798  *{Shadow}, giue me this man: hee presents no marke to the
1799  *Enemie, the foe- man may with as great ayme leuell at
1800  *the edge of a Pen- knife: and for a Retrait, how swiftly
1801  *will this {Feeble}, the Womans Taylor, runne off. O, giue
1802  *me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a
1803   Calyuer into {Warts} hand, {Bardolph}.
1804   <S {Bard}.> Hold {Wart}, Trauerse: thus, thus, thus.
1805  *<S {Falst}.> Come, manage me your Calyuer: so: very well,
1806  *go- too, very good, exceeding good. O, giue me alwayes
1807  *a little, leane, old, chopt, bald Shot. Well said {Wart}, thou
1808   art a good Scab: hold, there is a Tester for thee.
1809  *<S {Shal}.> Hee is not his Crafts- master, hee doth not doe
1810  *it right. I remember at Mile- end- Greene, when I lay
1811  *at {Clements} Inne, I was then Sir {Dagonet} in {Arthurs}
1812  *Show: there was a little quiuer fellow, and hee would
1813  *manage you his Peece thus: and hee would about,
1814  *and about, and come you in, and come you in: Rah,
1815  *tah, tah, would hee say, Bownce would hee say, and
1816  *away againe would hee goe, and againe would he come:
1817   I shall neuer see such a fellow.
1818  *<S {Falst}.> These fellowes will doe well, Master {Shallow}.
1819  *Farewell Master {Silence}, I will not vse many wordes with
1820  *you: fare you well, Gentlemen both: I thanke you:
1821  *I must a dozen mile to night. {Bardolph}, giue the Souldiers
1822   Coates.
1823  *<S {Shal}.> Sir {Iohn}, Heauen blesse you, and prosper your
1824  *Affaires, and send vs Peace. As you returne, visit
1825  *my house. Let our old acquaintance be renewed: per-aduenture
1826   I will with you to the Court.
1827   <S {Falst}.> I would you would, Master {Shallow}.
1828  *<S {Shal}.> Go- too: I haue spoke at a word. Fare you
1829   well.  <D {Exit}.>
1830  *<S {Falst}.> Fare you well, gentle Gentlemen. On {Bar-dolph},
1831  *leade the men away. As I returne, I will fetch off
1832  *these Iustices: I doe see the bottome of Iustice {Shal-low}.
1833  *How subiect wee old men are to this vice of Ly-ing?
1834  *This same staru'd Iustice hath done nothing but
1835  *prate to me of the wildenesse of his Youth, and the
1836  *Feates hee hath done about Turnball- street, and euery
1837  *third word a Lye, duer pay'd to the hearer, then the
1838  *Turkes Tribute. I doe remember him at {Clements} Inne,
1839  *like a man made after Supper, of a Cheese- paring. When
1840  *hee was naked, hee was, for all the world, like a forked
1841  *Radish, with a Head fantastically caru'd vpon it with a
1842  *Knife. Hee was so forlorne, that his Dimensions (to
1843  *any thicke sight) were inuincible. Hee was the very
1844  *{Genius} of Famine: hee came euer in the rere- ward of
1845  *the Fashion: And now is this Vices Dagger become a
1846  *Squire, and talkes as familiarly of {Iohn} of Gaunt, as if
1847  *hee had beene sworne Brother to him: and Ile be sworne
1848  *hee neuer saw him but once in the Tilt- yard, and then he
1849  *burst his Head, for crowding among the Marshals men.
1850  *I saw it, and told {Iohn} of Gaunt, hee beat his owne
1851  *Name, for you might haue truss'd him and all his Ap-parrell
1852  *into an Eele- skinne: the Case of a Treble Hoe-boy
1853  *was a Mansion for him: a Court: and now hath
1854  *hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with
1855  *him, if I returne: and it shall goe hard, but I will make
1856  *him a Philosophers two Stones to me. If the young
1857  *Dace be a Bayt for the old Pike, I see no reason, in the
1858  *Law of Nature, but I may snap at him. Let time shape,
1859   and there an end. <D {Exeunt}.>
1860   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
1861   <D {Enter the Arch- bishop, Mowbray, Hastings},
1862   {Westmerland, Coleuile}.>
1863   <S {Bish}.> What is this Forrest call'd?
1864  *<S {Hast}.> 'Tis Gaultree Forrest, and't shall please your
1865   Grace.
1866  *<S {Bish}.> Here stand (my Lords) and send discouerers forth,
1867   To know the numbers of our Enemies.
      <P Xgg2>
1868   <S {Hast}.> Wee haue sent forth alreadie.
1869   <S {Bish}.> 'Tis well done.
1870   My Friends, and Brethren (in these great Affaires)
1871   I must acquaint you, that I haue receiu'd
1872   New- dated Letters from {Northumberland}:
1873   Their cold intent, tenure, and substance thus.
1874   Here doth hee wish his Person, with such Powers
1875   As might hold sortance with his Qualitie,
1876   The which hee could not leuie: whereupon
1877   Hee is retyr'd, to ripe his growing Fortunes,
1878   To Scotland; and concludes in heartie prayers,
1879   That your Attempts may ouer- liue the hazard,
1880   And fearefull meeting of their Opposite.
1881  *<S {Mow}.> Thus do the hopes we haue in him, touch ground,
1882   And dash themselues to pieces.
1883   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1884   <S {Hast}.> Now? what newes?
1885   <S {Mess}.> West of this Forrest, scarcely off a mile,
1886   In goodly forme, comes on the Enemie:
1887   And by the ground they hide, I iudge their number
1888   Vpon, or neere, the rate of thirtie thousand.
1889   <S {Mow}.> The iust proportion that we gaue them out.
1890   Let vs sway- on, and face them in the field.
1891   <D {Enter Westmerland}.>
1892   <S {Bish}.> What well- appointed Leader fronts vs here?
1893   <S {Mow}.> I thinke it is my Lord of Westmerland.
1894   <S {West}.> Health, and faire greeting from our Generall,
1895   The Prince, Lord {Iohn}, and Duke of Lancaster.
1896   <S {Bish}.> Say on (my Lord of Westmerland) in peace:
1897   What doth concerne your comming?
1898   <S {West}.> Then (my Lord)
1899   Vnto your Grace doe I in chiefe addresse
1900   The substance of my Speech. If that Rebellion
1901   Came like it selfe, in base and abiect Routs,
1902   Led on by bloodie Youth, guarded with Rage,
1903   And countenanc'd by Boyes, and Beggerie:
1904   I say, if damn'd Commotion so appeare,
1905   In his true, natiue, and most proper shape,
1906   You (Reuerend Father, and these Noble Lords)
1907   Had not beene here, to dresse the ougly forme
1908   Of base, and bloodie Insurrection,
1909   With your faire Honors. You, Lord Arch- bishop,
1910   Whose Sea is by a Ciuill Peace maintain'd,
1911   Whose Beard, the Siluer Hand of Peace hath touch'd,
1912   Whose Learning, and good Letters, Peace hath tutor'd,
1913   Whose white Inuestments figure Innocence,
1914   The Doue, and very blessed Spirit of Peace.
1915   Wherefore doe you so #ill translate your selfe,
1916   Out of the Speech of Peace, that beares such grace,
1917   Into the harsh and boystrous Tongue of Warre?
1918   Turning your Bookes to Graues, your Inke to Blood,
1919   Your Pennes to Launces, and your Tongue diuine
1920   To a lowd Trumpet, and a Point of Warre.
1921   <S {Bish}.> Wherefore doe I this? so the Question stands.
1922   Briefely to this end: Wee are all diseas'd,
1923   And with our surfetting, and wanton howres,
1924   Haue brought our selues into a burning Feuer,
1925   And wee must bleede for it: of which Disease,
1926   Our late King {Richard} (being infected) dy'd.
1927   But (my most Noble Lord of Westmerland)
1928   I take not on me here as a Physician,
1929   Nor doe I, as an Enemie to Peace,
1930   Troope in the Throngs of Militarie men:
1931   But rather shew #a while like fearefull Warre,
1932   To dyet ranke Mindes, sicke of happinesse,
1933   And purge th' obstructions, which begin to stop
1934   Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.
1935   I haue in equall ballance iustly weigh'd,
1936  *What wrongs our Arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
1937   And finde our Griefes heauier then our Offences.
1938   Wee see which way the streame of Time doth runne,
1939   And are enforc'd from our most quiet there,
1940   By the rough Torrent of Occasion,
1941   And haue the summarie of all our Griefes
1942   (When time shall serue) to shew in Articles;
1943   Which long ere this, wee offer'd to the King,
1944   And might, by no Suit, gayne our Audience:
1945   When wee are wrong'd, and would vnfold our Griefes,
1946   Wee are deny'd accesse vnto his Person,
1947   Euen by those men, that most haue done vs wrong.
1948   The dangers of the dayes but newly gone,
1949   Whose memorie is written on the Earth
1950   With yet appearing blood; and the examples
1951   Of euery Minutes instance (present now)
1952   Hath put vs in these ill- beseeming Armes:
1953   Not to breake Peace, or any Branch of it,
1954   But to establish here a Peace indeede,
1955   Concurring both in Name and Qualitie.
1956   <S {West}.> When euer yet was your Appeale deny'd?
1957   Wherein haue you beene galled by the King?
1958   What Peere hath beene suborn'd, to grate on you,
1959   That you should seale this lawlesse bloody Booke
1960   Of forg'd Rebellion, with a Seale diuine?
1961   <S {Bish}.> My Brother generall, the Common- wealth,
1962   I make my Quarrell, in particular.
1963   <S {West}.> There is no neede of any such redresse:
1964   Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
1965   <S {Mow}.> Why not to him in part, and to vs all,
1966   That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,
1967   And suffer the Condition of these Times
1968   To lay a heauie and vnequall Hand vpon our Honors?
1969   <S {West}.> O my good Lord {Mowbray},
1970   Construe the Times to their Necessities,
1971   And you shall say (indeede) it is the Time,
1972   And not the King, that doth you iniuries.
1973   Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,
1974   Either from the King, or in the present Time,
1975   That you should haue an ynch of any ground
1976   To build a Griefe on: were you not restor'd
1977   To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,
1978   Your Noble, and right well- remembred Fathers?
1979   <S {Mow}.> What thing, in Honor, had my Father lost,
1980   That need to be reuiu'd, and breath'd in me?
1981   The King that lou'd him, as the State stood then,
1982   Was forc'd, perforce compell'd to banish him:
1983   And then, that {Henry Bullingbrooke} and hee
1984   Being mounted, and both rowsed in their Seates,
1985   Their neighing Coursers daring of the Spurre,
1986   Their armed Staues in charge, their Beauers downe,
1987   Their eyes of fire, sparkling through sights of Steele,
1988   And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:
1989   Then, then, when there was nothing could haue stay'd
1990   My Father from the Breast of {Bullingbrooke};
1991   O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,
1992   (His owne Life hung vpon the Staffe hee threw)
1993   Then threw hee downe himselfe, and all their Liues,
1994   That by Indictment, and by dint of Sword,
1995   Haue since mis- carryed vnder {Bullingbrooke}.
      <P Xgg2v>
1996  *<S {West}.> You speak (Lord {Mowbray}) now you know not what.
1997   The Earle of Hereford was reputed then
1998   In England the most valiant Gentleman.
1999  *Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue smil'd?
2000   But if your Father had beene Victor there,
2001   Hee ne're had borne it out of Couentry.
2002   For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,
2003   Cry'd hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,
2004   Were set on {Herford}, whom they doted on,
2005   And bless'd, and grac'd, and did more then the King.
2006   But this is meere digression from my purpose.
2007   Here come I from our Princely Generall,
2008   To know your Griefes; to tell you, from his Grace,
2009   That hee will giue you Audience: and wherein
2010   It shall appeare, that your demands are iust,
2011   You shall enioy them, euery thing set off,
2012   That might so much as thinke you Enemies.
2013   <S {Mow}.> But hee hath forc'd vs to compell this Offer,
2014   And it proceedes from Pollicy, not Loue.
2015   <S {West}.> {Mowbray}, you ouer- weene to take it so:
2016   This Offer comes from Mercy, not from Feare.
2017   For loe, within a Ken our Army lyes,
2018   Vpon mine Honor, all too confident
2019   To giue admittance to a thought of feare.
2020   Our Battaile is more full of Names then yours,
2021   Our Men more perfect in the vse of Armes,
2022   Our Armor all as strong, our Cause the best;
2023   Then Reason will, our hearts should be as good.
2024   Say you not then, our Offer is compell'd.
2025   <S {Mow}.> Well, by my #will, wee shall admit no Parley.
2026   <S {West}.> That argues but the shame of your offence:
2027   A rotten Case abides no handling.
2028   <S {Hast}.> Hath the Prince {Iohn} a full Commission,
2029   In very ample vertue of his Father,
2030   To heare, and absolutely to determine
2031   Of what Conditions wee shall stand vpon?
2032   <S {West}.> That is intended in the Generals Name:
2033   I muse you make so slight a Question.
2034  *<S {Bish}.> Then take (my Lord of Westmerland) this Schedule,
2035   For this containes our generall Grieuances:
2036   Each seuerall Article herein redress'd,
2037   All members of our Cause, both here, and hence,
2038   That are insinewed to this Action,
2039   Acquitted by a true substantiall forme,
2040   And present execution of our wills,
2041   To vs, and to our purposes confin'd,
2042   Wee come within our awfull Banks againe,
2043   And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace.
2044  *<S {West}.> This will I shew the Generall. Please you Lords,
2045   In sight of both our Battailes, wee may meete
2046   At either end in peace: which Heauen so frame,
2047   Or to the place of difference call the Swords,
2048   Which must decide it.
2049   <S {Bish}.> My Lord, wee will doe so.
2050   <S {Mow}.> There is a thing within my Bosome tells me,
2051   That no Conditions of our Peace can stand.
2052   <S {Hast}.> Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace
2053   Vpon such large termes, and so absolute,
2054   As our Conditions shall consist vpon,
2055   Our Peace shall stand as firme as Rockie Mountaines.
2056   <S {Mow}.> #I, but our valuation shall be such,
2057   That euery slight, and false- deriued Cause,
2058   Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Reason,
2059   Shall, to the King, taste of this Action:
2060   That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,
2061   Wee shall be winnowed with so rough a winde,
2062   That euen our Corne shall seeme as light as Chaffe,
2063   And good from bad finde no partition.
2064   <S {Bish}.> No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie
2065   Of daintie, and such picking Grieuances:
2066   For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,
2067   Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.
2068   And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,
2069   And keepe no Tell- tale to his Memorie,
2070   That may repeat, and Historie his losse,
2071   To new remembrance. For full  well hee knowes,
2072   Hee cannot so precisely weede this Land,
2073   As his mis- doubts present occasion:
2074   His foes are so en- rooted with his friends,
2075   That plucking to vnfixe an Enemie,
2076   Hee doth vnfasten so, and shake a friend.
2077   So that this Land, like an offensiue wife,
2078   That hath enrag'd him on, to offer strokes,
2079   As he is striking, holds his Infant vp,
2080   And hangs resolu'd Correction in the Arme,
      <C B>
2081   That was vprear'd to execution.
2082   <S {Hast}.> Besides, the King hath wasted all his Rods,
2083   On late Offenders, that he now doth lacke
2084   The very Instruments of Chasticement:
2085   So that his power, like to a Fanglesse Lion
2086   May offer, but not hold.
2087   <S {Bish}.> 'Tis very true:
2088   And therefore be assur'd (my good Lord Marshal)
2089   If we do now make our attonement well,
2090   Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)
2091   Grow stronger, for the breaking.
2092   <S {Mow}.> Be it so:
2093   Heere is return'd my Lord of Westmerland.
2094   <D {Enter Westmerland}.>
2095  *<S {West}.> The Prince is here at hand: pleaseth your Lordship
2096   To meet his Grace, iust distance 'tweene our Armies?
2097  *<S {Mow}.> Your Grace of Yorke, in heauen's name then
2098   forward.
2099  *<S {Bish}.> Before, and greet his Grace (my Lord) we come.
2100   <D {Enter Prince Iohn}.>
2101  *<S {Iohn}.> You are wel encountred here (my cosin {Mowbray})
2102   Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,
2103   And so to you Lord {Hastings}, and to all.
2104   My Lord of Yorke, it better shew'd with you,
2105   When that your Flocke (assembled by the Bell)
2106   Encircled you, to heare with reuerence
2107   Your exposition on the holy Text,
2108   Then now to see you heere an Iron man
2109   Chearing a rowt of Rebels with your Drumme,
2110   Turning the Word, to Sword; and Life to death:
      <C H>
2111   That man that sits within a Monarches heart,
2112   And ripens in the Sunne- shine of his fauor,
2113   Would hee abuse the Countenance of the King,
2114   Alack, what Mischiefes might hee set abroach,
2115   In shadow of such Greatnesse? With you, Lord Bishop,
2116   It is euen so. Who hath not heard it spoken,
2117   How deepe you were within the Bookes of Heauen?
2118   To vs, the Speaker in his Parliament;
2119   To vs, th' imagine Voyce of Heauen it selfe:
2120   The very Opener, and Intelligencer,
2121   Betweene the Grace, the Sanctities of Heauen;
2122   And our dull workings. O, who shall beleeue,
2123   But you mis- vse the reuerence of your Place,
2124   Employ the Countenance, and Grace of Heauen,
2125   As a false Fauorite doth his Princes Name,
2126   In deedes dis- honorable? You haue taken vp,
      <P Xgg3>
2127   Vnder the counterfeited Zeale of Heauen,
2128   The Subiects of Heauens Substitute, my Father,
2129   And both against the Peace of Heauen, and him,
2130   Haue here vp- swarmed them.
2131   <S {Bish}.> Good my Lord of Lancaster,
2132   I am not here against your Fathers Peace:
2133   But (as I told my Lord of Westmerland)
2134   The Time (mis- order'd) doth in common sence
2135   Crowd vs, and crush vs, to this monstrous Forme,
2136   To hold our safetie vp. I sent your Grace
2137   The parcels, and particulars of our Griefe,
2138  *The which hath been with scorne shou'd from the Court:
2139   Whereon this {Hydra}- Sonne of Warre is borne,
2140   Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepe,
2141   With graunt of our most iust and right desires;
2142   And true Obedience, of this Madnesse cur'd,
2143   Stoope tamely to the foot of Maiestie.
2144   <S {Mow}.> If not, wee readie are to trye our fortunes,
2145   To the last man.
2146   <S {Hast}.> And though wee here fall downe,
2147   Wee haue Supplyes, to second our Attempt:
2148   If they mis- carry, theirs shall second them.
2149   And so, successe of Mischiefe shall be borne,
2150   And Heire from Heire shall hold this Quarrell vp,
2151   Whiles England shall haue generation.
2152   <S {Iohn}.> You are too shallow ({Hastings})
2153   Much too shallow,
2154   To sound the bottome of the after- Times.
2155   <S {West}.> Pleaseth your Grace, to answere them directly,
2156   How farre- forth you doe like their Articles.
2157   <S {Iohn}.> I like them all, and doe allow them well:
2158   And sweare here, by the honor of my blood,
2159   My Fathers purposes haue beene mistooke,
2160   And some, about him, haue too lauishly
2161   Wrested his meaning, and Authoritie.
2162   My Lord, these Griefes shall be with speed redrest:
2163   Vpon my Life, they shall. If this may please you,
2164   Discharge your Powers vnto their  seuerall Counties,
2165   As wee will ours: and here, betweene the Armies,
2166   Let's drinke together friendly, and embrace,
2167   That all their eyes may beare those Tokens home,
2168   Of our restored Loue, and Amitie.
2169   <S {Bish}.> I take your Princely word, for these redresses.
2170   <S {Iohn}.> I giue it you, and will maintaine my word:
2171   And thereupon I drinke vnto your Grace.
2172   <S {Hast}.> Goe Captaine, and deliuer to the Armie
2173   This newes of Peace: let them haue pay, and part:
2174   I know, it will well please them.
2175   High thee Captaine.  <D {Exit}.>
2176   <S {Bish}.> To you, my Noble Lord of Westmerland.
2177   <S {West}.> I pledge your Grace:
2178   And if you knew what paines I haue bestow'd,
2179   To breede this present Peace,
2180   You would drinke freely: but my loue to ye,
2181   Shall shew it selfe more openly hereafter.
2182   <S {Bish}.> I doe not doubt you.
2183   <S {West}.> I am glad of it.
2184   Health to my Lord, and gentle Cousin {Mowbray}.
2185   <S {Mow}.> You wish me health in very happy season,
2186   For I am, on the sodaine, something #ill.
2187   <S {Bish}.> Against #ill Chances, men are euer merry,
2188   But heauinesse fore- runnes the good euent.
2189  *<S {West}.> Therefore be merry (Cooze) since sodaine sorrow
2190   Serues to say thus: some good thing comes to morrow.
2191   <S {Bish}.> Beleeue me, I am passing light in spirit.
2192   <S {Mow}.> So much the worse, if your owne Rule be true.
2193  *<S {Iohn}.> The word of Peace is render'd: hearke how
2194   they showt.
2195   <S {Mow}.> This had been chearefull, after Victorie.
2196   <S {Bish}.> A Peace is of the nature of a Conquest:
2197   For then   both parties nobly are subdu'd,
2198   And neither partie looser.
2199   <S {Iohn}.> Goe (my Lord)
2200   And let our Army be discharged too:
2201   And good my Lord (so please you) let our Traines
2202   March by vs, that wee may peruse the men  <D {Exit}.>
2203   Wee should haue coap'd withall.
2204   <S {Bish}.> Goe, good Lord {Hastings}:
2205   And ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.  <D {Exit}.>
2206   <S {Iohn}.> I trust (Lords) wee shall lye to night together.
2207   <D {Enter Westmerland}.>
2208   Now Cousin, wherefore stands our Army still?
2209   <S {West}.> The Leaders hauing charge from you to stand,
2210   Will not goe off, vntill they heare you speake.
2211   <S {Iohn}.> They know their duties.  <D {Enter Hastings}.>
2212   <S {Hast}.> Our Army is dispers'd:
2213  *Like youthfull Steeres, vnyoak'd, they tooke their course
2214   East, West, North, South: or like a Schoole, broke vp,
2215   Each hurryes towards his home, and sporting place.
2216  *<S {West}.> Good tidings (my Lord {Hastings}) for the which,
2217   I doe arrest thee (Traytor) of high Treason:
2218   And you Lord Arch- bishop, and you Lord {Mowbray},
2219   Of Capitall Treason, I attach you both.
2220   <S {Mow}.> Is this proceeding iust, and honorable?
2221   <S {West}.> Is your Assembly so?
2222   <S {Bish}.> Will you thus breake your faith?
2223   <S {Iohn}.> I pawn'd thee none:
2224   I promis'd you redresse of these same Grieuances
2225   Whereof you did complaine; which, by mine Honor,
2226   I will performe, with a most Christian care.
2227   But for you (Rebels) looke to taste the due
2228   Meet for Rebellion, and such Acts as yours.
2229   Most shallowly did you these Armes commence,
2230   Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.
2231   Strike vp our Drummes, pursue the scatter'd stray,
2232   Heauen, and not wee, haue safely fought to day.
2233   Some guard these Traitors to the Block of Death,
2234   Treasons true Bed, and yeelder vp of breath.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2235   <D {Enter Falstaffe and Colleuile}.>
2236  *<S {Falst}.> What's your Name, Sir? of what Condition are
2237   you? and of what place, I pray?
2238   <S {Col}.> I am a Knight, Sir:
2239   And my Name is {Colleuile} of the Dale.
2240  *<S {Falst}.> Well then, {Colleuile} is your Name, a Knight is
2241  *your Degree, and your Place, the Dale. {Colleuile} shall
2242  *still be your Name, a Traytor your Degree, and the Dun-geon
2243  *your Place, a place deepe enough: so shall you be
2244   still {Colleuile} of the Dale.
2245   <S {Col}.> Are not you Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}?
2246  *<S {Falst}.> As good a man as he sir, who ere I am: doe yee
2247  *yeelde sir, or shall I sweate for you? if I doe sweate, they
2248  *are the drops of thy Louers, and they weep for thy death,
2249  *therefore rowze vp Feare and Trembling, and do obser-uance
2250   to my mercy.
2251  *<S {Col}.> I thinke you are Sir {Iohn Falstaffe}, & in that thought
2252   yeeld me.
2253  *<S {Fal}.> I haue a whole Schoole of tongues in this belly of
2254  *mine, and not a Tongue of them all, speakes anie other
2255  *word but my name: #and I had but a belly of any indiffe-rencie,
2256  *I were simply the most actiue fellow in Europe:
2257  *my wombe, my wombe, my wombe vndoes mee. Heere
2258   comes our Generall.
      <P Xgg3v>
2259   <D {Enter Prince Iohn, and Westmerland}.>
2260   <S {Iohn}.> The heat is past, follow no farther now:
2261   Call in the Powers, good Cousin {Westmerland}.
2262   Now {Falstaffe}, where haue you beene all this while?
2263   When euery thing is ended, then you come.
2264   These tardie Tricks of yours will (on my life)
2265   One time, or other, breake some Gallowes back.
2266  *<S {Falst}.> I would bee sorry (my Lord) but it should bee
2267  *thus: I neuer knew yet, but rebuke and checke was the
2268  *reward of Valour. Doe you thinke me a Swallow, an Ar-row,
2269  *or a Bullet? Haue I, in my poore and olde Motion,
2270  *the expedition of Thought? I haue speeded hither with
2271  *the very extremest ynch of possibilitie. I haue fowndred
2272  *nine score and odde Postes: and heere (trauell- tainted
2273  *as I am) haue, in my pure and immaculate Valour, taken
2274  *Sir {Iohn Colleuile} of the Dale, a most furious Knight, and
2275  *valorous Enemie: But what of that? hee saw mee, and
2276  *yeelded: that I may iustly say with the hooke- nos'd
2277   fellow of Rome, I came, saw, and ouer- came.
2278  *<S {Iohn}.> It was more of his Courtesie, then your deser-uing.
2279  _
2280  *<S {Falst}.> I know not: heere hee is, and heere I yeeld
2281  *him: and I beseech your Grace, let it be book'd, with
2282  *the rest of this dayes deedes; or I sweare, I will haue it
2283  *in a particular Ballad, with mine owne Picture on the top
2284  *of it ({Colleuile} kissing my foot:) To the which course, if
2285  *I be enforc'd, if you do not all shew like gilt two- pences
2286  *to me; and I, in the cleare Skie of Fame, o're- shine you
2287  *as much as the Full Moone doth the Cynders of the Ele-ment
2288  *(which shew like Pinnes- heads to her) beleeue not
2289  *the Word of the Noble: therefore let mee haue right,
2290   and let desert mount.
2291   <S {Iohn}.> Thine's too heauie to mount.
2292   <S {Falst}.> Let it shine then.
2293   <S {Iohn}.> Thine's too thick to shine.
2294  *<S {Falst}.> Let it doe something (my good Lord) that may
2295   doe me good, and call it what you will.
2296   <S {Iohn}.> Is thy Name {Colleuile}?
2297   <S {Col}.> It is (my Lord.)
2298   <S {Iohn}.> A famous Rebell art thou, {Colleuile}.
2299   <S {Falst}.> And a famous true Subiect tooke him.
2300   <S {Col}.> I am (my Lord) but as my Betters are,
2301   That led me hither: had they beene rul'd by me,
2302   You should haue wonne them dearer then you haue.
2303  *<S {Falst}.> I know not how they sold themselues, but thou
2304  *like a kinde fellow, gau'st thy selfe away; and I thanke
2305   thee, for thee.
2306   <D {Enter Westmerland}.>
2307   <S {Iohn}.> Haue you left pursuit?
2308   <S {West}.> Retreat is made, and Execution stay'd.
2309   <S {Iohn}.> Send {Colleuile}, with his Confederates,
2310   To Yorke, to present Execution.
2311   {Blunt}, leade him hence, and see you guard him sure.
2312   <D {Exit with Colleuile}.>
2313   And now dispatch we toward the Court (my Lords)
2314   I heare the King, my Father, is sore sicke.
2315   Our Newes shall goe before vs, to his Maiestie,
2316   Which (Cousin) you shall beare, to comfort him:
2317   And wee with sober speede will follow you.
2318  *<S {Falst}.> My Lord, I beseech you, giue me leaue to goe
2319  *through Gloucestershire: and when you come to Court,
2320   stand my good Lord, 'pray, in your good report.
2321   <S {Iohn}.> Fare you well, {Falstaffe}: I, in my condition,
2322   Shall better speake of you, then you deserue.  <D {Exit}.>
2323  *<S {Falst}.> I would you had but the wit: 'twere better
2324  *then your Dukedome. Good faith, this same young so-ber- blooded
2325  *Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot
2326  *make him laugh: but that's no maruaile, hee drinkes no
2327  *Wine. There's neuer any of these demure Boyes come
2328  *to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth so ouer- coole
2329  *their blood, and making many Fish- Meales, that they
2330  *fall into a kinde of Male Greene- sicknesse: and then,
2331  *when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally
2332  *Fooles, and Cowards; which some of vs should be too,
2333  *but for inflamation. A good Sherris- Sack hath a two- fold
2334  *operation in it: it ascends me into the Braine, dryes
2335  *me there all the foolish, and dull, and cruddie Vapours,
2336  *which enuiron it: makes it apprehensiue, quicke, forge-tiue,
2337  *full of nimble, fierie, and delectable shapes; which
2338  *deliuer'd o're to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the
2339  *Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The second propertie of
2340  *your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood:
2341  *which before (cold, and setled) left the Liuer white, and
2342  *pale; which is the Badge of Pusillanimitie, and Cowar-dize:
2343  *but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it course
2344  *from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth
2345  *the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the
2346  *rest of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then
2347  *the Vitall Commoners, and in- land pettie Spirits, muster
2348  *me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pufft
2349  *vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this
2350  *Valour comes of Sherris. So, that skill in the Weapon
2351  *is nothing, without Sack (for that sets it a- worke:) and
2352  *Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till
2353  *Sack commences it, and sets it in act, and vse. Hereof
2354  *comes it, that Prince {Harry} is valiant: for the cold blood
2355  *hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like
2356  *leane, stirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and
2357  *tyll'd, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and
2358  *good store of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot,
2359  *and valiant. If I had a thousand Sonnes, the first Principle
2360  *I would teach them, should be to forsweare thinne Pota-tions,
2361  *and to addict themselues to Sack.  <D {Enter Bardolph}.>
2362   How now {Bardolph}?
2363   <S {Bard}.> The Armie is discharged all, and gone.
2364  *<S {Falst}.> Let them goe: Ile through Gloucestershire,
2365  *and there will I visit Master {Robert Shallow}, Esquire: I
2366  *haue him alreadie tempering betweene my finger and my
2367   thombe, and shortly will I seale with him. Come away.
2368   <D {Exeunt}.>
2369   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2370   <D {Enter King, Warwicke, Clarence, Gloucester}.>
2371  *<S {King}.> Now Lords, if Heauen doth giue successefull end
2372   To this Debate, that bleedeth at our doores,
2373   Wee will our Youth lead on to higher Fields,
2374   And draw no Swords, but what are sanctify'd.
2375   Our Nauie is addressed, our Power collected,
2376   Our Substitutes, in absence, well inuested,
2377   And euery thing lyes leuell to our wish;
2378   Onely wee want a little personall Strength:
2379   And pawse vs, till these Rebels, now a- foot,
2380   Come vnderneath the yoake of Gouernment.
2381   <S {War}.> Both which we doubt not, but your Maiestie
2382   Shall soone enioy.
      <P Xgg4>
2383  *<S {King}.> {Humphrey} (my Sonne of Gloucester) where is
2384   the Prince, your Brother?
2385  *<S {Glo}.> I thinke hee's gone to hunt (my Lord) at Wind-sor.
2386  _
2387   <S {King}.> And how accompanied?
2388   <S {Glo}.> I doe not know (my Lord.)
2389  *<S {King}.> Is not his Brother, {Thomas} of Clarence, with
2390   him?
2391   <S {Glo}.> No (my good Lord) hee is in presence heere.
2392   <S {Clar}.> What would my Lord, and Father?
2393  *<S {King}.> Nothing but well to thee, {Thomas} of Clarence.
2394   How chance thou art not with the Prince, thy Brother?
2395   Hee loues thee, and thou do'st neglect him ({Thomas}.)
2396   Thou hast a better place in his Affection,
2397   Then all thy Brothers: cherish it (my Boy)
2398   And Noble Offices thou may'st effect
2399   Of Mediation (after I am dead)
2400   Betweene his Greatnesse, and thy other Brethren.
2401   Therefore omit him not: blunt not his Loue,
2402   Nor loose the good aduantage of his Grace,
2403   By seeming cold, or carelesse of his #will.
2404   For hee is gracious, if hee be obseru'd:
2405   Hee hath a Teare for Pitie, and a Hand
2406   Open (as Day) for melting Charitie:
2407   Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, hee's Flint,
2408   As humorous as Winter, and as sudden,
2409   As Flawes congealed in the Spring of day.
2410   His temper therefore must be well obseru'd:
2411   Chide him for faults, and doe it reuerently,
2412   When you perceiue his blood enclin'd to mirth:
2413   But being moodie, giue him Line, and scope,
2414   Till that his passions (like a Whale on ground)
2415  *Confound themselues with working. Learne this {Thomas},
2416   And thou shalt proue a shelter to thy friends,
2417   A Hoope of Gold, to binde thy Brothers in:
2418   That the vnited Vessell of their Blood
2419   (Mingled with Venome of Suggestion,
2420   As force, perforce, the Age will powre it in)
2421   Shall neuer leake, though it doe worke as strong
2422   As {Aconitum}, or rash Gun- powder.
2423   <S {Clar}.> I shall obserue him with all care, and loue.
2424  *<S {King}.> Why art thou not at Windsor with him ({Tho-mas}?)
2425  _
2426  *<S {Clar}.> Hee is not there to day: hee dines in Lon-don.
2427  _
2428  *<S {King}.> And how accompanyed? Canst thou tell
2429   that?
2430  *<S {Clar}.> With {Pointz}, and other his continuall fol-lowers.
2431  _
2432   <S {King}.> Most subiect is the fattest Soyle to Weedes:
2433   And hee (the Noble Image of my Youth)
2434   Is ouer- spread with them: therefore my griefe
2435   Stretches it selfe beyond the howre of death.
2436   The blood weepes from my heart, when I doe shape
2437   (In formes imaginarie) th' vnguided Dayes,
2438   And rotten Times, that you shall looke vpon,
2439   When I am sleeping with my Ancestors.
2440   For when his head- strong Riot hath no Curbe,
2441   When Rage and hot- Blood are his Counsailors,
2442   When Meanes and lauish Manners meete together;
2443   Oh, with what Wings shall his Affections flye
2444   Towards fronting Perill, and oppos'd Decay?
2445  *<S {War}.> My gracious Lord, you looke beyond him quite:
2446   The Prince but studies his Companions,
2447  *Like a strange Tongue: wherein, to gaine the Language,
2448   'Tis needfull, that the most immodest word
2449   Be look'd vpon, and learn'd: which once attayn'd,
2450   Your Highnesse knowes, comes to no farther vse,
2451   But to be knowne, and hated. So, like grosse termes,
2452   The Prince will, in the perfectnesse of time,
2453   Cast off his followers: and their memorie
2454   Shall as a Patterne, or a Measure, liue,
2455   By which his Grace must mete the liues of others,
2456   Turning past- euills to aduantages.
2457  *<S {King}.> 'Tis seldome, when the #Bee doth leaue her Combe
2458   In the dead Carrion.
2459   <D {Enter Westmerland}.>
2460   Who's heere? {Westmerland}?
2461   <S {West}.> Health to my Soueraigne, and new happinesse
2462   Added to that, that I am to deliuer.
2463   Prince {Iohn}, your Sonne, doth kisse your Graces Hand:
2464   {Mowbray}, the Bishop, {Scroope}, {Hastings}, and all,
2465   Are brought to the Correction of your Law.
2466   There is not now a Rebels Sword vnsheath'd,
2467   But Peace puts forth her Oliue euery where:
2468   The manner how this Action hath beene borne,
2469   Here (at more leysure) may your Highnesse reade,
2470   With euery course, in his particular.
2471   <S {King}.> O {Westmerland}, thou art a Summer Bird,
2472   Which euer in the haunch of Winter sings
2473   The lifting vp of day.
2474   <D {Enter Harcourt}.>
2475   Looke, heere's more newes.
2476   <S {Harc}.> From Enemies, Heauen keepe your Maiestie:
2477   And when they stand against you, may they fall,
2478   As those that I am come to tell you of.
2479   The Earle {Northumberland}, and the Lord {Bardolfe},
2480   With a great Power of English, and of Scots,
2481   Are by the Sherife of Yorkeshire ouerthrowne:
2482   The manner, and true order of the fight,
2483   This Packet (please it you) containes at large.
2484   <S {King}.> And wherefore should these good newes
2485   Make me sicke?
2486   Will Fortune neuer come with both hands full,
2487   But write her faire words still in foulest Letters?
2488   Shee eyther giues a Stomack, and no Foode,
2489   (Such are the poore, in health) or else a Feast,
2490   And takes away the Stomack (such are the Rich,
2491   That haue aboundance, and enioy it not.)
2492   I should reioyce now, at this happy newes,
2493   And now my Sight fayles, and my Braine is giddie.
2494   O me, come neere me, now I am much #ill.
2495   <S {Glo}.> Comfort your Maiestie.
2496   <S {Cla}.> Oh, my Royall Father.
2497  *<S {West}.> My Soueraigne Lord, cheare vp your selfe, looke
2498   vp.
2499   <S {War}.> Be patient (Princes) you doe know, these Fits
2500   Are with his Highnesse very ordinarie.
2501   Stand from him, giue him ayre:
2502   Hee'le straight be well.
2503   <S {Clar}.> No, no, hee cannot long hold out: these pangs,
2504   Th' incessant care, and labour of his Minde,
2505   Hath wrought the Mure, that should confine it in,
2506   So thinne, that Life lookes through, and will breake out.
2507   <S {Glo}.> The people feare me: for they doe obserue
2508   Vnfather'd Heires, and loathly Births of Nature:
2509   The Seasons change their manners, as the Yeere
2510   Had found some Moneths asleepe, and leap'd them ouer.
2511  *<S {Clar}.> The Riuer hath thrice flow'd, no ebbe betweene:
2512   And the old folke (Times doting Chronicles)
2513   Say it did so, a little time before
2514   That our great Grand- sire {Edward} sick'd, and dy'de.
      <P Xgg4v>
2515  *<S {War}.> Speake lower (Princes) for the King reco-uers.
2516  _
2517   <S {Glo}.> This Apoplexie will (certaine) be his end.
2518   <S {King}.> I pray you take me vp, and beare me hence
2519   Into some other Chamber: softly 'pray.
2520   Let there be no noyse made (my gentle friends)
2521   Vnlesse some dull and fauourable hand
2522   Will whisper Musicke to my wearie Spirit.
2523   <S {War}.> Call for the Musicke in the other Roome.
2524   <S {King}.> Set me the Crowne vpon my Pillow here.
2525   <S {Clar}.> His eye is hollow, and hee changes much.
2526   <S {War}.> Lesse noyse, lesse noyse.
2527   <D {Enter Prince Henry}.>
2528   <S {P.Hen}.> Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
2529   <S {Clar}.> I am here (Brother) full of heauinesse.
2530  *<S {P.Hen}.> How now? Raine within doores, and none
2531   abroad? How doth the King?
2532   <S {Glo}.> Exceeding #ill.
2533   <S {P.Hen}.> Heard hee the good newes yet?
2534   Tell it him.
2535   <S {Glo}.> Hee alter'd much, vpon the hearing it.
2536   <S {P.Hen}.> If hee be sicke with Ioy,
2537   Hee'le recouer without Physicke.
2538   <S {War}.> Not so much noyse (my Lords)
2539   Sweet Prince speake lowe,
2540   The King, your Father, is dispos'd to sleepe.
2541   <S {Clar}.> Let vs with- draw into the other Roome.
2542   <S {War}.> #Wil't please your Grace to goe along with vs?
2543   <S {P.Hen}.> No: I will sit, and watch here, by the King.
2544   Why doth the Crowne lye there, vpon his Pillow,
2545   Being so troublesome a Bed- fellow?
2546   O pollish'd Perturbation! Golden Care!
2547   That keep'st the Ports of Slumber open wide,
2548   To many a watchfull Night: sleepe with it now,
2549   Yet not so sound, and halfe so deepely sweete,
2550   As hee whose Brow (with homely Biggen bound)
2551   Snores out the Watch of Night. O Maiestie!
2552   When thou do'st pinch thy Bearer, thou do'st sit
2553   Like a rich Armor, worne in heat of day,
2554   That scald'st with safetie: by his Gates of breath,
2555   There lyes a dowlney feather, which stirres not:
2556   Did hee suspire, that light and weightlesse dowlne
2557   Perforce must moue. My gracious Lord, my Father,
2558   This sleepe is sound indeede: this is a sleepe,
2559   That from this Golden Rigoll hath diuorc'd
2560   So many English Kings. Thy due, from me,
2561   Is Teares, and heauie Sorrowes of the Blood,
2562   Which Nature, Loue, and filiall tendernesse,
2563   Shall (O deare Father) pay thee plenteously.
2564   My due, from thee, is this Imperiall Crowne,
2565   Which (as immediate from thy Place, and Blood)
2566   Deriues it selfe to me. Loe, heere it sits,
2567   Which Heauen shall guard:
2568  *And put the worlds whole strength into one gyant Arme,
2569   It shall not force this Lineall Honor from me.
2570   This, from thee, will I to mine leaue,
2571   As 'tis left to me.  <D {Exit}.>
2572   <D {Enter Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence}.>
2573   <S {King}.> {Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence}.
2574   <S {Clar}.> Doth the King call?
2575  *<S {War}.> What would your Maiestie? how fares your
2576   Grace?
2577  *<S {King}.> Why did you leaue me here alone (my Lords?)
2578   <S {Cla}.> We left the Prince (my Brother) here (my Liege)
2579   Who vndertooke to sit and watch by you.
2580  *<S {King}.> The Prince of Wales? where is hee? let mee
2581   see him.
2582   <S {War}.> This doore is open, hee is gone this way.
2583  *<S {Glo}.> Hee came not through the Chamber where wee
2584   stayd.
2585  *<S {King}.> Where is the Crowne? who tooke it from my
2586   Pillow?
2587  *<S {War}.> When wee with- drew (my Liege) wee left it
2588   heere.
2589   <S {King}.> The Prince hath ta'ne it hence:
2590   Goe seeke him out.
2591   Is hee so hastie, that hee doth suppose
2592  *My sleepe, my death? Finde him (my Lord of Warwick)
2593   Chide him hither: this part of his conioynes
2594   With my disease, and helpes to end me.
2595   See Sonnes, what things you are:
2596   How quickly Nature falls into reuolt,
2597   When Gold becomes her Obiect?
2598   For this, the foolish ouer- carefull Fathers
2599   Haue broke their sleepes with thoughts,
2600   Their braines with care, their bones with industry.
2601   For this, they haue ingrossed and pyl'd vp
2602   The canker'd heapes of strange- atchieued Gold:
2603   For this, they haue beene thoughtfull, to inuest
2604   Their Sonnes with Arts, and Martiall Exercises:
2605   When, like the #Bee, culling from euery flower
2606   The vertuous Sweetes, our Thighes packt with Wax,
2607   Our Mouthes with Honey, wee bring it to the Hiue;
2608   And like the Bees, are murthered for our paines.
2609   This bitter taste yeelds his engrossements,
2610   To the ending Father.
2611   <D {Enter Warwicke}.>
2612   Now, where is hee, that will not stay so long,
2613   Till his Friend Sicknesse hath determin'd me?
2614  *<S {War}.> My Lord, I found the Prince in the next Roome,
2615   Washing with kindly Teares his gentle Cheekes,
2616   With such a deepe demeanure, in great sorrow,
2617   That Tyranny, which neuer quafft but blood,
2618   Would (by beholding him) haue wash'd his Knife
2619   With gentle eye- drops. Hee is comming hither.
2620   <S {King}.> But wherefore did hee take away the Crowne?
2621   <D {Enter Prince Henry}.>
2622   Loe, where hee comes. Come hither to me ({Harry}.)
2623   Depart the Chamber, leaue vs heere alone.  <D {Exit}.>
2624   <S {P.Hen}.> I neuer thought to heare you speake againe.
2625   <S {King}.> Thy wish was Father ({Harry}) to that thought:
2626   I stay too long by thee, I wearie thee.
2627   Do'st thou so hunger for my emptie Chayre,
2628   That thou wilt needes inuest thee with mine Honors,
2629   Before thy howre be ripe? O foolish Youth!
2630  *Thou seek'st the Greatnesse, that will ouer- whelme thee.
2631   Stay but a little: for my Cloud of Dignitie
2632   Is held from falling, with so weake a winde,
2633   That it will quickly drop: my Day is dimme.
2634   Thou hast stolne that, which after some few howres
2635   Were thine, without offence: and at my death
2636   Thou hast seal'd vp my expectation.
2637   Thy Life did manifest, thou lou'dst me not,
2638   And thou wilt haue me dye assur'd of it.
2639   Thou hid'st a thousand Daggers in thy thoughts,
2640   Which thou hast whetted on thy stonie heart,
2641   To stab at halfe an howre of my Life.
2642   What? canst thou not forbeare me halfe an howre?
      <P Xgg5><C B>
2643   Then get thee gone, and digge my graue thy selfe,
2644   And bid the merry Bels ring to thy eare
2645   That thou art Crowned, not that I am dead.
2646   Let all the Teares, that should bedew my Hearse
2647   Be drops of Balme, to sanctifie thy head:
2648   Onely compound me with forgotten dust.
2649   Giue that, which gaue thee life, vnto the Wormes:
2650   Plucke downe my Officers, breake my Decrees;
2651   For now a time is come, to mocke at Forme.
2652   Henry the fift is Crown'd: Vp Vanity,
2653   Downe Royall State: All you sage Counsailors, hence:
2654   And to the English Court, assemble now
2655   From eu'ry Region, Apes of Idlenesse.
2656   Now neighbor- Confines, purge you of your Scum:
2657   Haue you a Ruffian that will sweare? drinke? dance?
2658   Reuell the night? Rob? Murder? and commit
2659   The oldest sinnes, the newest kinde of wayes?
2660   Be happy, he will trouble you no more:
2661   England, shall double gill'd, his trebble guilt.
2662   England, shall giue him Office, Honor, #Might:
2663   For the Fift {Harry}, from curb'd License pluckes
2664   The muzzle of Restraint; and the wilde Dogge
2665   Shall flesh his tooth in euery Innocent.
2666   O my poore Kingdome (sicke, with ciuill blowes)
2667   When that my Care could not with- hold thy Ryots,
2668   What wilt thou do, when Ryot is thy Care?
2669   O, thou wilt be a Wildernesse againe,
2670   Peopled with Wolues (thy old Inhabitants.)
2671   <S {Prince}.> O pardon me (my Liege)
2672   But for my Teares,
2673   The most Impediments vnto my Speech,
2674   I had fore- stall'd this deere, and deepe Rebuke,
2675   Ere you (with greefe) had spoke, and I had heard
2676   The course of it so farre. There is your Crowne,
2677   And he that weares the Crowne immortally,
2678   Long guard it yours. If I affect it more,
2679   Then as your Honour, and as your Renowne,
2680   Let me no more from this Obedience rise,
2681   Which my most true, and inward duteous Spirit
2682   Teacheth this prostrate, and exteriour bending.
2683   Heauen witnesse with me, when I heere came in,
2684   And found no course of breath within your Maiestie,
2685   How cold it strooke my heart. If I do faine,
2686   O let me, in my present wildenesse, dye,
2687   And neuer liue, to shew th' incredulous World,
2688   The Noble change that I haue purposed.
2689   Comming to looke on you, thinking you dead,
2690   (And dead almost (my Liege) to thinke you were)
2691   I spake vnto the Crowne (as hauing sense)
2692   And thus vpbraided it. The Care on thee depending,
2693   Hath fed vpon the body of my Father,
2694   Therefore, thou best of Gold, art worst of Gold.
2695   Other, lesse fine in Charract, is more precious,
2696   Preseruing life, in Med'cine potable:
2697   But thou, most Fine, most Honour'd, most Renown'd,
2698   Hast eate the Bearer vp.
2699   Thus (my Royall Liege)
2700   Accusing it, I put it on my Head,
2701   To try with it (as with an Enemie,
2702   That had before my face murdred my Father)
2703   The Quarrell of a true Inheritor.
2704   But if it did infect my blood with Ioy,
2705   Or swell my Thoughts, to any straine of Pride,
2706   If any Rebell, or vaine spirit of mine,
2707   Did, with the least Affection of a Welcome,
2708   Giue entertainment to the #might of it,
2709   Let heauen, for euer, keepe it from my head,
2710   And make me, as the poorest Vassaile is,
2711   That doth with awe, and terror kneele to it.
2712   <S {King}.> O my Sonne!
2713   Heauen put it in thy minde to take it hence,
2714   That thou might'st ioyne the more, thy Fathers loue,
2715   Pleading so wisely, in excuse of it.
2716   Come hither {Harrie}, sit thou by my bedde,
2717   And heare (I thinke, the very latest Counsell
2718   That euer I shall breath: Heauen knowes, my Sonne)
2719   By what by- pathes, and indirect crook'd- wayes
2720   I met this Crowne: and I my selfe know well
2721   How troublesome it sate vpon my head.
2722   To thee, it shall descend with better Quiet,
2723   Better Opinion, better Confirmation:
2724   For all the soyle of the Atchieuement goes
2725   With me, into the Earth. It seem'd in mee,
2726   But as an Honour snatch'd with boyst'rous hand,
2727   And I had many liuing, to vpbraide
2728   My gaine of it, by their Assistances,
2729   Which dayly grew to Quarrell, and to Blood- shed,
2730   Wounding supposed Peace.
2731   All these bold Feares,
2732   Thou seest (with perill) I haue answered:
2733   For all my Reigne, hath beene but as a Scene
2734   Acting that argument. And now my death
2735   Changes the Moode: For what in me, was purchas'd,
2736   Falles vpon thee, in a more Fayrer sort.
2737   So thou, the Garland wear'st successiuely.
2738   Yet, though thou stand'st more sure, then I could do,
2739   Thou art not firme enough, since greefes are greene:
2740   And all thy Friends, which thou must make thy Friends
2741   Haue but their stings, and teeth, newly tak'n out,
2742   By whose fell working, I was first aduanc'd,
2743   And by whose power, I well might lodge a Feare
2744   To be againe displac'd. Which to auoyd,
2745   I cut them off: and had a purpose now
2746   To leade out many to the Holy Land;
2747   Least rest, and lying still, might make them looke
2748   Too neere vnto my State.
2749   Therefore (my {Harrie})
2750   Be it thy course to busie giddy Mindes
2751  *With Forraigne Quarrels: that Action hence borne out,
2752   May waste the memory of the former dayes.
2753   More would I, but my Lungs are wasted so,
2754   That strength of Speech it vtterly deni'de mee.
2755   How I came by the Crowne, O heauen forgiue:
2756   And grant it may, with thee, in true peace liue.
2757   <S {Prince}.> My gracious Liege:
2758   You wonne it, wore it: kept it, gaue it me,
2759   Then plaine and right must my possession be;
2760   Which I, with more, then with a Common paine,
2761   'Gainst all the World, will rightfully maintaine.
2762   <D {Enter Lord Iohn of Lancaster},
2763   {and Warwicke}.>
2764   <S {King}.> Looke, looke,
2765   Heere comes my {Iohn} of Lancaster:
2766   <S {Iohn}.> Health, Peace, and Happinesse,
2767   To my Royall Father.
2768   <S {King}.> Thou bring'st me happinesse and Peace
2769   (Sonne {Iohn}:)
2770   But health (alacke) with youthfull wings is flowne
2771   From this bare, wither'd Trunke. Vpon thy sight
2772   My worldly businesse makes a period.
      <P Xgg5v>
2773   Where is my Lord of Warwicke?
2774   <S {Prin}.> My Lord of Warwicke.
2775   <S {King}.> Doth any name particular, belong
2776   Vnto the Lodging, where I first did swoon'd?
2777   <S {War}.> 'Tis call'd {Ierusalem}, my Noble Lord.
2778   <S {King}.> Laud be to heauen:
2779   Euen there my life must end.
2780   It hath beene prophesi'de to me many yeares,
2781   I should not dye, but in {Ierusalem}:
2782   Which (vainly) I suppos'd the Holy- Land.
2783   But beare me to that Chamber, there Ile lye:
2784   In that {Ierusalem}, shall {Harry} dye.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2785   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima}.>
2786   <D {Enter Shallow, Silence, Falstaffe, Bardolfe},
2787   {Page, and Dauie}.>
2788  *<S {Shal}.> By Cocke and Pye, you shall not away to night.
2789   What {Dauy}, I say.
2790   <S {Fal}.> You must excuse me, M[aster]. {Robert Shallow}.
2791  *<S {Shal}.> I will not excuse you: you shall not be excused.
2792  *Excuses shall not be admitted: there is no excuse shall
2793   serue: you shall not be excus'd.
2794   Why {Dauie}.
2795   <S {Dauie}.> Heere sir.
2796  *<S {Shal}.> {Dauy, Dauy, Dauy}, let me see ({Dauy}) let me see:
2797  *{William} Cooke, bid him come hither. Sir {Iohn}, you shal
2798   not be excus'd.
2799  *<S {Dauy}.> Marry sir, thus: those Precepts cannot bee
2800  *seru'd: and againe sir, shall we sowe the head- land with
2801   Wheate?
2802  *<S {Shal}.> With red Wheate {Dauy}. But for {William} Cook:
2803   are there no yong Pigeons?
2804   <S {Dauy}.> Yes Sir.
2805   Heere is now the Smithes note, for Shooing,
2806   And Plough- Irons.
2807   <S {Shal}.> Let it be cast, and payde: Sir {Iohn}, you shall
2808   not be excus'd.
2809  *<S {Dauy}.> Sir, a new linke to the Bucket must needes bee
2810  *had: And Sir, doe you meane to stoppe any of {Williams}
2811  *Wages, about the Sacke he lost the other day, at {Hinckley}
2812   Fayre?
2813   <S {Shal}.> He shall answer it:
2814  *Some Pigeons {Dauy}, a couple of short- legg'd Hennes: a
2815  *ioynt of Mutton, and any pretty little tine Kickshawes,
2816   tell {William} Cooke.
2817   <S {Dauy}.> Doth the man of Warre, stay all night sir?
2818   <S {Shal}.> Yes {Dauy}:
2819  *I will vse him well. A Friend i'th Court, is better then a
2820  *penny in purse. Vse his men well {Dauy}, for they are ar-rant
2821   Knaues, and will backe- bite.
2822  *<S {Dauy}.> No worse then they are bitten, sir: For they
2823   haue maruellous fowle linnen.
2824  *<S {Shallow}.> Well conceited {Dauy}: about thy Businesse,
2825   {#Dauy}.
2826   <S {Dauy}.> I beseech you sir,
2827  *To countenance {William Visor} of Woncot, against {Cle-ment}
2828   {Perkes} of the hill.
2829  *<S {Shal}.> There are many Complaints {Dauy}, against that
2830  *{Visor}, that {Visor} is an arrant Knaue, on my know-ledge.
2831  _
2832  *<S {Dauy}.> I graunt your Worship, that he is a knaue (Sir:)
2833  *But yet heauen  forbid Sir, but a Knaue should haue some
2834  *Countenance, at his Friends request. An honest man sir,
2835  *is able to speake for himselfe, when a Knaue is not. I haue
2836  *seru'd your Worshippe truely sir, these eight yeares: and
2837  *if I cannot once or twice in a Quarter beare out a knaue,
2838  *against an honest man, I haue but a very litle credite with
2839  *your Worshippe. The Knaue is mine honest Friend Sir,
2840  *therefore I beseech your Worship, let him bee Counte-nanc'd.
2841  _
2842   <S {Shal}.> Go #too,
2843   I say he shall haue no wrong: Looke about {Dauy}.
2844   Where are you Sir {Iohn}? Come, off with your Boots.
2845   Giue me your hand M[aster]. {Bardolfe}.
2846   <S {Bard}.> I am glad to see your Worship.
2847  *<S {Shal}.> I thanke thee, with all my heart, kinde Master
2848   {Bardolfe}: and welcome my tall Fellow:
2849   Come Sir {Iohn}.
2850  *<S {Falstaffe}.> Ile follow you, good Master {Robert Shallow}.
2851  *{Bardolfe}, looke to our Horsses. If I were saw'de into
2852  *Quantities, I should make foure dozen of such bearded
2853  *Hermites staues, as Master {Shallow}. It is a wonderfull
2854  *thing to see the semblable Coherence of his mens spirits,
2855  *and his: They, by obseruing of him, do beare themselues
2856  *like foolish Iustices: Hee, by conuersing with them, is
2857  *turn'd into a Iustice- like Seruingman. Their spirits are
2858  *so married in Coniunction, with the participation of So-ciety,
2859  *that they flocke together in consent, like so ma-ny
2860  *Wilde- Geese. If I had a suite to Mayster {Shallow}, I
2861  *would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing
2862  *neere their Mayster. If to his Men, I would currie with
2863  *Maister {Shallow}, that no man could better command his
2864  *Seruants. It is certaine, that either wise bearing, or ig-norant
2865  *Carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
2866  *another: therefore, let men take heede of their Compa-nie.
2867  *I will deuise matter enough out of this {Shallow}, to
2868  *keepe Prince {Harry} in continuall Laughter, the wearing
2869  *out of sixe Fashions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Ac-tions,
2870  *and he shall laugh with {Interuallums}. O it is much
2871  *that a Lye (with a slight Oath) and a iest (with a sadde
2872  *brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache
2873  *in his shoulders. O you shall see him laugh, till his Face
2874   be like a wet Cloake, #ill laid vp.
2875   <S {Shal}.> Sir {Iohn}.
2876  *<S {Falst}.> I come Master {Shallow}, I come Master {Shallow}.
2877   <D {Exeunt}>
2878   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2879   <D {Enter the Earle of Warwicke, and the Lord}
2880   {Chiefe Iustice}.>
2881  *<S {Warwicke}.> How now, my Lord Chiefe Iustice, whe-ther
2882   away?
2883   <S {Ch.Iust}.> How doth the King?
2884   <S {Warw}.> Exceeding well: his Cares
2885   Are now, all ended.
2886   <S {Ch.Iust}.> I hope, not dead.
2887   <S {Warw}.> Hee's walk'd the way of Nature,
2888   And to our purposes, he liues no more.
2889  *<S {Ch.Iust}.> I would his Maiesty had call'd me with him,
2890   The seruice, that I truly did his life,
2891   Hath left me open to all iniuries.
      <P Xgg6>
2892   <S {War}.> Indeed I thinke the yong King loues you not.
2893   <S {Ch.Iust}.> I know he doth not, and do arme my selfe
2894   To welcome the condition of the Time,
2895   Which cannot looke more hideously vpon me,
2896   Then I haue drawne it in my fantasie.
2897   <D {Enter Iohn of Lancaster, Gloucester},
2898   {and Clarence}.>
2899   <S {War}.> Heere come the heauy Issue of dead {Harrie}:
2900   O, that the liuing {Harrie} had the temper
2901   Of him, the worst of these three Gentlemen:
2902   How many Nobles then, should hold their places,
2903   That must strike saile, to Spirits of vilde sort?
2904   <S {Ch.Iust}.> Alas, I feare, all will be ouer- turn'd.
2905  *<S {Iohn}.> Good morrow Cosin Warwick, good morrow.
2906   <S {Glou}. {Cla}.> Good morrow, Cosin.
2907   <S {Iohn}.> We meet, like men, that had forgot to speake.
2908   <S {War}.> We do remember: but our Argument
2909   Is all too heauy, to admit much talke.
2910  *<S {Ioh}.> Well: Peace be with him, that hath made vs heauy
2911   <S {Ch.Iust}.> Peace be with vs, least we be heauier.
2912  *<S {Glou}.> O, good my Lord, you haue lost a friend indeed:
2913   And I dare sweare, you borrow not that face
2914   Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your owne.
2915  *<S {Iohn}.> Though no man be assur'd what grace to finde,
2916   You stand in coldest expectation.
2917   I am the sorrier, would 'twere otherwise.
2918  *<S {Cla}.> Wel, you must now speake Sir {Iohn Falstaffe} faire,
2919   Which swimmes against your streame of Quality.
2920   <S {Ch.Iust}.> Sweet Princes: what I did, I did in Honor,
2921   Led by th' Imperiall Conduct of my Soule,
2922   And neuer shall you see, that I will begge
2923   A ragged, and fore- stall'd Remission.
2924   If Troth, and vpright Innocency fayle me,
2925   Ile to the King (my Master) that is dead,
2926   And tell him, who hath sent me after him.
2927   <S {War}.> Heere comes the Prince.
2928   <D {Enter Prince Henrie}.>
2929  *<S {Ch.Iust}.> Good morrow: and heauen saue your Maiesty
2930   <S {Prince}.> This new, and gorgeous Garment, Maiesty,
2931   Sits not so easie on me, as you thinke.
2932   Brothers, you mixe your Sadnesse with some Feare:
2933   This is the English, not the Turkish Court:
2934   Not {Amurah}, an {Amurah} succeeds,
2935   But {Harry}, {Harry}: Yet be sad (good Brothers)
2936   For (to speake truth) it very well becomes you:
2937   Sorrow, so Royally in you appeares,
2938   That I will deeply put the Fashion on,
2939   And weare it in my heart. Why then be sad,
2940   But entertaine no more of it (good Brothers)
2941   Then a ioynt burthen, laid vpon vs all.
2942   For me, by Heauen (I bid you be assur'd)
2943   Ile be your Father, and your Brother too:
2944   Let me but beare your Loue, Ile beare your Cares;
2945   But weepe that {Harrie}'s dead, and so will I.
2946   But {Harry} liues, that shall conuert those Teares
2947   By number, into houres of Happinesse.
2948   <S {Iohn}, {#&c.>}  We hope no other from your Maiesty.
2949   <S {Prin}.> You all looke strangely on me: and you most,
2950   You are (I thinke) assur'd, I loue you not.
2951   <S {Ch.Iust}.> I am assur'd (if I be measur'd rightly)
2952   Your Maiesty hath no iust cause to hate mee.
2953  *<S {Pr}.> No? How might a Prince of my great hopes forget
2954   So great Indignities you laid vpon me?
2955   What? Rate? Rebuke? and roughly send to Prison
2956   Th' immediate Heire of England? Was this easie?
2957   May this be wash'd in {Lethe}, and forgotten?
2958   <S {Ch.Iust}.> I then did vse the Person of your Father:
2959   The Image of his power, lay then in me,
2960   And in th' administration of his Law,
2961   Whiles I was busie for the Commonwealth,
2962   Your Highnesse pleased to forget my place,
2963   The Maiesty, and power of Law, and Iustice,
2964   The Image of the King, whom I presented,
2965   And strooke me in my very Seate of Iudgement:
2966   Whereon (as an Offender to your Father)
2967   I gaue bold way to my Authority,
2968   And did commit you. If the deed were #ill,
2969   Be you contented, wearing now the Garland,
2970   To haue a Sonne, set your Decrees at naught?
2971   To plucke downe Iustice from your awefull Bench?
2972   To trip the course of Law, and blunt the Sword
2973   That guards the peace, and safety of your Person?
2974   Nay more, to spurne at your most Royall Image,
2975   And mocke your workings, in a Second body?
2976   Question your Royall Thoughts, make the case yours:
2977   Be now the Father, and propose a Sonne:
2978   Heare your owne dignity so much prophan'd,
2979   See your most dreadfull Lawes, so loosely slighted;
2980   Behold your selfe, so by a Sonne disdained:
2981   And then imagine me, taking your part,
2982   And in your power, soft silencing your Sonne:
2983   After this cold considerance, sentence me;
2984   And, as you are a King, speake in your State,
2985   What I haue done, that misbecame my place,
2986   My person, or my Lieges Soueraigntie.
2987  *<S {Prin}.> You are right Iustice, and you weigh this well:
2988   Therefore still beare the Ballance, and the Sword:
2989   And I do wish your Honors may encrease,
2990   Till you do liue, to see a Sonne of mine
2991   Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
2992   So shall I liue, to speake my Fathers words:
2993   Happy am I, that haue a man so bold,
2994   That dares do Iustice, on my proper Sonne;
2995   And no lesse happy, hauing such a Sonne,
2996   That would deliuer vp his Greatnesse so,
2997   Into the hands of Iustice. You did commit me:
2998   For which, I do commit into your hand,
2999   Th' vnstained Sword that you haue vs'd to beare:
3000   With this Remembrance; That you vse the same
3001   With the like bold, iust, and impartiall spirit
3002   As you haue done 'gainst me. There is my hand,
3003   You shall be as a Father, to my Youth:
3004   My voice shall sound, as you do prompt mine eare,
3005   And I will stoope, and humble my Intents,
3006   To your well- practis'd, wise Directions.
3007   And Princes all, beleeue me, I beseech you:
3008   My Father is gone wilde into his Graue,
3009   (For in his Tombe, lye my Affections)
3010   And with his Spirits, sadly I suruiue,
3011   To mocke the expectation of the World;
3012   To frustrate Prophesies, and to race out
3013   Rotten Opinion, who hath writ me downe
3014   After my seeming. The Tide of Blood in me,
3015   Hath prowdly flow'd in Vanity, till now.
3016   Now doth it turne, and ebbe backe to the Sea,
3017   Where it shall mingle with the state of Floods,
3018   And flow henceforth in formall Maiesty.
3019   Now call we our High Court of Parliament,
3020   And let vs choose such Limbes of Noble Counsaile,
      <P Xgg6v>
3021   That the great Body of our State may go
3022   In equall ranke, with the best gouern'd Nation,
3023   That Warre, or Peace, or both at once may be
3024   As things acquainted and familiar to vs,
3025   In which you (Father) shall haue formost hand.
3026   Our Coronation done, we will accite
3027   (As I before remembred) all our State,
3028   And heauen (consigning to my good intents)
3029   No Prince, nor Peere, shall haue iust cause to say,
3030   Heauen shorten {Harries} happy life, one day.  <D {Exeunt}.>

3037   {Silence}, and then to bed.

3040  *Sir {Iohn}: Marry, good ayre. Spread {Dauy}, spread {Dauie}:
3041   Well said {Dauie}.

3053  *<S {Fal}.> There's a merry heart, good M[aster]. {Silence}, Ile giue
3054   you a health for that anon.
3055   <S {Shal}.> Good M[aster]. {Bardolfe}: some wine, {Dauie}.
3056  *<S {Da}.> Sweet sir, sit: Ile be with you anon: most sweete
3057  *sir, sit. Master Page, good M[aster]. Page, sit: Proface. What
3058  *you want in meate, wee'l haue in drinke: but you beare,

3067   Mettle.
3068  *<S {Sil}.> Who I? I haue beene merry twice and once, ere

3076   <S {Fal}.> Well said, M[aster]. {Silence}.
3077  *<S {Sil}.> If we shall be merry, now comes in the sweete of
3078   the night.
3079   <S {Fal}.> Health, and long life to you, M[aster]. {Silence}.
3080  *<S {Sil}.> Fill the Cuppe, and let it come. Ile pledge you a
3081   mile to the bottome.
3082  *<S {Shal}.> Honest {Bardolfe}, welcome: If thou want'st any
3083  *thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome my
3084  *little tyne theefe, and welcome indeed too: Ile drinke to
3085   M[aster]. {Bardolfe}, and to all the Cauileroes about London.
3086   <S {Dau}.> I hope to see London, once ere I die.
3087   <S {Bar}.> If I might see you there, {Dauie}.
3088  *<S {Shal}.> You'l cracke a quart together? Ha, will you not
3089   M[aster]. {Bardolfe}?
3090   <S {Bar}.> Yes Sir, in a pottle pot.
3091  *<S {Shal}.> I thanke thee: the knaue will sticke by thee, I
3092   can assure thee that. He will not out, he is true bred.
3093   <S {Bar}.> And Ile sticke by him, sir.
3094  *<S {Shal}.> Why there spoke a King: lack nothing, be merry.
3095   Looke, who's at doore there, ho: who knockes?
3096   <S {Fal}.> Why now you haue done me right.
3097  *<S {Sil}.> Do me right, and dub me Knight, {Samingo}. Is't
3098   not so?
3099   <S {Fal}.> 'Tis so.
3100  *<S {Sil}.> Is't so? Why then say an old man can do somwhat.
3101  *<S {Dau}.> If it please your Worshippe, there's one {Pistoll}
3102   come from the Court with newes.
3103   <S {Fal}.> From the Court? Let him come in.
3104   <D {Enter Pistoll}.>
3105   How now Pistoll?

3107   <S {Fal}.> What winde blew you hither, Pistoll?
3108  *<S {Pist}.> Not the #ill winde which blowes none to good,
3109  *sweet Knight: Thou art now one of the greatest men in
3110   the Realme.
3111  *<S {Sil}.> Indeed, I thinke he bee, but Goodman {Puffe} of
3112   Barson.
3113  *<S {Pist}.> Puffe? puffe in thy teeth, most recreant Coward
3114  *base. Sir {Iohn}, I am thy Pistoll, and thy Friend: helter
3115  *skelter haue I rode to thee, and tydings do I bring, and

3122   <S {Fal}.> O base Assyrian Knight, what is thy newes?
3123   Let King {Couitha} know the truth thereof.
3124   <S {Sil}.> And Robin- hood, Scarlet, and Iohn.
3125   <S {Pist}.> Shall dunghill Curres confront the {Hellicons}?
3126   And shall good newes be baffel'd?
3127   Then Pistoll lay thy head in Furies lappe.
3128   <S {Shal}.> Honest Gentleman,
3129   I know not your breeding.
3130   <S {Pist}.> Why then Lament therefore.
3131   <S {Shal}.> Giue me pardon, Sir.
3132  *If sir, you come with news from the Court, I take it, there
3133  *is but two wayes, either to vtter them, or to conceale
3134   them. I am Sir, vnder the King, in some Authority.
3135   <S {Pist}.> Vnder which King?
3136   {Bezonian}, speake, or dye.
3137   <S {Shal}.> Vnder King {Harry}.
3138   <S {Pist}.> {Harry} the Fourth? or Fift?
3139   <S {Shal}.> {Harry} the Fourth.
3140   <S {Pist}.> A footra for thine Office.
3141   Sir {Iohn}, thy tender Lamb- kinne, now is King,
3142   {Harry} the Fift's the man, I speake the truth.
3143   When Pistoll lyes, do this, and figge- me, like
3144   The bragging Spaniard.

3145   <S {Fal}.> What, is the old King dead?
3146   <S {Pist}.> As naile in doore.
3147   The things I speake, are iust.
3148   <S {Fal}.> Away {Bardolfe}, Sadle my Horse,
3149   Master {Robert Shallow}, choose what Office thou wilt
3150  *In the Land, 'tis thine. {Pistol}, I will double charge thee
3151   With Dignities.
3152   <S {Bard}.> O ioyfull day:
3153   I would not take a Knighthood for my Fortune.
3154   <S {Pist}.> What? I do bring good newes.
3155  *<S {Fal}.> Carrie Master {Silence} to bed: Master {Shallow}, my
3156  *Lord {Shallow}, be what thou wilt, I am Fortunes Steward.
3157  *Get on thy Boots, wee'l ride all night. Oh sweet Pistoll:
3158  *Away {Bardolfe}: Come Pistoll, vtter more to mee: and
3159  *withall deuise something to do thy selfe good. Boote,

3164   Iustice.
3165   <S {Pist}.> Let Vultures vil'de seize on his Lungs also:

3224   <S {Pist}.> It doth so.
3225   <S {Fal}.> My deuotion.
3226   <S {Pist}.> It doth, it doth, it doth.
3227   <S {Fal}.> As it were, to ride day and night,
3228   And not to deliberate, not to remember,
3229   Not to haue patience to shift me.
3230   <S {Shal}.> It is most certaine.
3231  *<S {Fal}.> But to stand stained with Trauaile, and sweating
3232  *with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else, putting
3233  *all affayres in obliuion, as if there were nothing els to bee
3234   done, but to see him.
3235  *<S {Pist}.> 'Tis {semper idem}: for {obsque hoc nihil est}. 'Tis all
3236   in euery part.
3237   <S {Shal}.> 'Tis so indeed.
3238  *<S {Pist}.> My Knight, I will enflame thy Noble Liuer, and
3239  *make thee rage. Thy {Dol}, and {Helen} of thy noble thoghts
3240  *is in base Durance, and contagious prison: Hall'd thi-ther
3241  *by most Mechanicall and durty hand. Rowze vppe
3242  *Reuenge from Ebon den, with fell Alecto's Snake, for
3243   {#Dol} is in. Pistol, speakes nought but troth.
3244   <S {Fal}.> I will deliuer her.
3245  *<S {Pistol}.> There roar'd the Sea: and Trumpet Clangour
3246   sounds.
3247   <D {The Trumpets sound. Enter King Henrie the}
3248   {Fift, Brothers, Lord Chiefe}
3249   {Iustice}.>
3250   <S {Falst}.> Saue thy Grace, King {Hall}, my Royall {Hall}.
3251  *<S {Pist}.> The heauens thee guard, and keepe, most royall
3252   Impe of Fame.
3253   <S {Fal}.> 'Saue thee my sweet Boy.
3254  *<S {King}.> My Lord Chiefe Iustice, speake to that vaine
3255   man.
3256   <S {Ch.Iust}.> Haue you your wits?
3257   Know you what 'tis you speake?
3258  *<S {Falst}.> My King, my Ioue; I speake to thee, my heart.
3259  *<S {King}.> I know thee not, old man: Fall to thy Prayers:
3260   How #ill white haires become a Foole, and Iester?
      <P Xgg7v>
3261   I haue long dream'd of such a kinde of man,
3262   So surfeit- swell'd, so old, and so prophane:
3263   But being awake, I do despise my dreame.
3264   Make lesse thy body (hence) and more thy Grace,
3265   Leaue gourmandizing; Know the Graue doth gape
3266   For thee, thrice wider then for other men.
3267   Reply not to me, with a Foole- borne Iest,
3268   Presume not, that I am the thing I was,
3269   For heauen doth know (so shall the world perceiue)
3270   That I haue turn'd away my former Selfe,
3271   So will I those that kept me Companie.
3272   When thou dost heare I am, as I haue bin,
3273   Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou was't
3274   The Tutor and the Feeder of my Riots:
3275   Till then, I banish thee, on paine of death,
3276   As I haue done the rest of my Misleaders,
3277   Not to come neere our Person, by ten mile.
3278   For competence of life, I will allow you,
3279   That lacke of meanes enforce you not to euill:
3280   And as we heare you do reforme your selues,
3281   We will according to your strength, and qualities,
3282   Giue you aduancement. Be it your charge (my Lord)
3283   To see perform'd the tenure of our word. Set on.
3284   <D {Exit King}.>
3285   <S {Fal}.> Master {Shallow}, I owe you a thousand pound.
3286  *<S {Shal}.> #I marry Sir {Iohn}, which I beseech you to let me
3287   haue home with me.
3288  *<S {Fal}.> That can hardly be, M[aster]. {Shallow}, do not you grieue
3289  *at this: I shall be sent for in priuate to him: Looke you,
3290  *he must seeme thus to the world: feare not your aduance-ment:
3291   I will be the man yet, that shall make you great.
3292  *<S {Shal}.> I cannot well perceiue how, vnlesse you should
3293  *giue me your Doublet, and stuffe me out with Straw. I
3294  *beseech you, good Sir {Iohn}, let mee haue fiue hundred of
3295   my thousand.
3296  *<S {Fal}.> Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you
3297   heard, was but a colour.
3298  *<S {Shall}.> A colour I feare, that you will dye in, Sir {Iohn}.
3299   <S {Fal}.> Feare no colours, go with me to dinner:
3300   Come Lieutenant {Pistol}, come {Bardolfe},
3301   I shall be sent for soone at night.
3302   <S {Ch.Iust}.> Go carry Sir {Iohn Falstaffe} to the Fleete,
3303   Take all his Company along with him.
3304   <S {Fal}.> My Lord, my Lord.
3305  *<S {Ch.Iust}.> I cannot now speake, I will heare you soone:
3306   Take them away.
3307   <S {Pist}.> {Si fortuna me tormento, spera me contento}.
3308   <D {Exit}. {Manent Lancaster and Chiefe Iustice}.>
3309   <S {Iohn}.> I like this faire proceeding of the Kings:
3310   He hath intent his wonted Followers
3311   Shall all be very well prouided for:
3312   But all are banisht, till their conuersations
3313   Appeare more wise, and modest to the world.
3314   <S {Ch.Iust}.> And so they are.
3315   <S {Iohn}.> The King hath call'd his Parliament,
3316   My Lord.
3317   <S {Ch.Iust}.> He hath.
3318   <S {Iohn}.> I will lay oddes, that ere this yeere expire,
3319   We beare our Ciuill Swords, and Natiue fire
3320   As farre as France. I heare a Bird so sing,
3321   Whose Musicke (to my thinking) pleas'd the King.
3322   Come, will you hence?  <D {Exeunt}>
3323   FINIS.
