5      If Musicke be the food of Loue, play on,
6      Giue me excesse of it: that surfetting,
7      The appetite may sicken, and so dye.
8      That straine agen, it had a dying fall:
9      O, it came ore my eare, like the sweet sound
10     That breathes vpon a banke of Violets;
11     Stealing, and giuing Odour. Enough, no more,
12     'Tis not so sweet now, as it was before.
13     O spirit of Loue, how quicke and fresh art thou,
14     That notwithstanding thy capacitie,
15     Receiueth as the Sea. Nought enters there,
16     Of what validity, and pitch so ere,
17     But falles into abatement, and low price
18     Euen in a minute; so full of shapes is fancie,
19     That it alone, is high fantasticall.
20     <S {Cu}.> Will you go hunt my Lord?
21     <S {Du}.> What {Curio}?
22     <S {Cu}.> The Hart.
23     <S {Du}.> Why so I do, the Noblest that I haue:
24     O when mine eyes did see {Oliuia} first,
25     Me thought she purg'd the ayre of pestilence;
26     That instant was I turn'd into a Hart,
27     And my desires like fell and cruell hounds,
28     Ere since pursue me. How now what newes from her?
29     <D {Enter Valentine}.>
30     <S {Val}.> So please my Lord, I might not be admitted,
31     But from her handmaid do returne this answer:
32     The Element it selfe, till seuen yeares heate,
33     Shall not behold her face at ample view:
34     But like a Cloystresse she will vailed walke,
35     And water once a day her Chamber round
36     With eye- offending brine: all this to season
37     A brothers dead loue, which she would keepe fresh
38     And lasting, in her sad remembrance.
39     <S {Du}.> O she that hath a heart of that fine frame
40     To pay this debt of loue but to a brother,
41     How will she loue, when the rich golden shaft
42     Hath kill'd the flocke of all affections else
43     That liue in her. When Liuer, Braine, and Heart,
44     These soueraigne thrones, are all supply'd and fill'd
45     Her sweete perfections with one selfe king:
46     Away before me, to sweet beds of Flowres,
47     Loue- thoughts lye rich, when canopy'd with bowres.
48     <D {Exeunt}>
49     <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
50     <D {Enter Viola, a Captaine, and Saylors}.>
51     <S {Vio}.> What Country (Friends) is this?
52     <S {Cap}.> This is Illyria Ladie.
53     <S {Vio}.> And what should I do in Illyria?
54     My brother he is in Elizium,
55    *Perchance he is not drown'd: What thinke you saylors?
56     <S {Cap}.> It is perchance that you your selfe were saued.
57    *<S {Vio}.> O my poore brother, and so perchance may he be.
58     <S {Cap}.> True Madam, and to comfort you with chance,
59     Assure your selfe, after our ship did split,
60     When you, and those poore number saued with you,
61     Hung on our driuing boate: I saw your brother
62     Most prouident in perill, binde himselfe,
63     (Courage and hope both teaching him the practise)
64     To a strong Maste, that liu'd vpon the sea:
65     Where like {Orion} on the Dolphines backe,
66     I saw him hold acquaintance with the waues,
67     So long as I could see.
68     <S {Vio}.> For saying so, there's Gold:
69     Mine owne escape vnfoldeth to my hope,
70     Whereto thy speech serues for authoritie
71     The like of him. Know'st thou this Countrey?
72     <S {Cap}.> #I Madam well, for I was bred and borne
73     Not three houres trauaile from this very place.
74     <S {Vio}.> Who gouernes heere?
75     <S {Cap}.> A noble Duke in nature, as in name.
76     <S {Vio}.> What is his name?
77     <S {Cap}.> {Orsino}.
78     <S {Vio}.> {Orsino}: I haue heard my father name him.
79     He was a Batchellor then.
80     <S {Cap}.> And so is now, or was so very late:
81     For but a month ago I went from hence,
82     And then 'twas fresh in murmure (as you know
83     What great ones do, the lesse will prattle of,)
84     That he did seeke the loue of faire {Oliuia}.
85     <S {Vio}.> What's shee?
86     <S {Cap}.> A vertuous maid, the daughter of a Count
87     That dide some tweluemonth since, then leauing her
88     In the protection of his sonne, her brother,
89     Who shortly also dide: for whose deere loue
90     (They say) she hath abiur'd the sight
91     And company of men.
92     <S {Vio}.> O that I seru'd that Lady,
93     And might not be deliuered to the world
      <P Y2v>
94     Till I had made mine owne occasion mellow
95     What my estate is.
96     <S {Cap}.> That were hard to compasse,
97     Because she will admit no kinde of suite,
98     No, not the Dukes.
99     <S {Vio}.> There is a faire behauiour in thee Captaine,
100    And though that nature, with a beauteous wall
101    Doth oft close in pollution: yet of thee
102    I will beleeue thou hast a minde that suites
103    With this thy faire and outward charracter.
104    I prethee (and Ile pay thee bounteously)
105    Conceale me what I am, and be my ayde,
106    For such disguise as haply shall become
107    The forme of my intent. Ile serue this Duke,
108    Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him,
109    It may be worth thy paines: for I can sing,
110    And speake to him in many sorts of Musicke,
111    That will allow me very worth his seruice.
112    What else may hap, to time I will commit,
113    Onely shape thou thy silence to my wit.
114    <S {Cap}.> Be you his Eunuch, and your Mute Ile bee,
115    When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
116    <S {Vio}.> I thanke thee: Lead me on.  <D {Exeunt}>
117    <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
118    <D {Enter Sir Toby, and Maria}.>
119   *<S {Sir} {To}.> What a plague meanes my Neece to take the
120   *death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemie to
121    life.
122   *<S {Mar}.> By my troth sir {Toby}, you must come in earlyer
123   *#a nights: your Cosin, my Lady, takes great exceptions
124    to your #ill houres.
125    <S {To}.> Why let her except, before excepted.
126    <S {Ma}.> #I, but you must confine your selfe within the
127    modest limits of order.
128   *<S {To}.> Confine? Ile confine my selfe no finer then I am:
129   *these cloathes are good enough to drinke in, and so bee
130   *these boots too: #and they be not, let them hang them-selues
131    in their owne straps.
132   *<S {Ma}.> That quaffing and drinking will vndoe you: I
133   *heard my Lady talke of it yesterday: and of a foolish
134   *knight that you brought in one night here, to be hir woer
135    <S {To}.> Who, Sir {Andrew Ague- cheeke}?
136    <S {Ma}.> #I he.
137    <S {To}.> He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
138    <S {Ma}.> What's that to th' purpose?
139    <S {To}.> Why he ha's three thousand ducates a yeare.
140   *<S {Ma}.> #I, but hee'l haue but a yeare in all these ducates:
141    He's a very foole, and a prodigall.
142   *<S {To}.> Fie, that you'l say so: he playes o'th Viol- de- gam-boys,
143   *and speaks three or four languages word for word
144    without booke, & hath all the good gifts of nature.
145   *<S {Ma}.> He hath indeed, almost naturall: for besides that
146   *he's a foole, he's a great quarreller: and but that hee hath
147   *the gift of a Coward, to allay the gust he hath in quarrel-ling,
148   *'tis thought among the prudent, he would quickely
149    haue the gift of a graue.
150    <S {Tob}.> By this hand they are scoundrels and substra-ctors
151    that say so of him. Who are they?
152   *<S {Ma}.> They that adde moreour, hee's drunke nightly
153    in your company.
154   *<S {To}.> With drinking healths to my Neece: Ile drinke
155   *to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, & drinke
156   *in Illyria: he's a Coward and a Coystrill that will not
157   *drinke to my Neece, till his braines turne o'th toe, like a
158   *parish top. What wench? {Castiliano vulgo}: for here coms
159    Sir {Andrew Agueface}.
160    <D {Enter Sir Andrew}.>
161    <S {And}.> Sir {Toby Belch}. How now sir {Toby Belch}?
162    <S {To}.> Sweet sir {Andrew}.
163    <S {And}.> Blesse you faire Shrew.
164    <S {Mar}.> And you too sir.
165    <S {Tob}.> Accost Sir {Andrew}, accost.
166    <S {And}.> What's that?
167    <S {To}.> My Neeces Chamber- maid.
168   *<S {Ma}.> Good Mistris accost, I desire better acquaintance
169    <S {Ma}.> My name is {Mary} sir.
170    <S {And}.> Good mistris {Mary}, accost.
171   *<S {To,}> You mistake knight: Accost, is front her, boord
172    her, woe her, assayle her.
173   *<S {And}.> By my troth I would not vndertake her in this
174    company. Is that the meaning of Accost?
175    <S {Ma}.> Far you well Gentlemen.
176    <S {To}.> #And thou let part so Sir {Andrew}, would thou
177    mightst neuer draw sword agen.
178   *<S {And}.> #And you part so mistris, I would I might neuer
179   *draw sword agen: Faire Lady, doe you thinke you haue
180    fooles in hand?
181    <S {Ma}.> Sir, I haue not you by'th hand.
182    <S {An}.> Marry but you shall haue, and heeres my hand.
183   *<S {Ma}.> Now sir, thought is free: I pray you bring your
184    hand to'th Buttry barre, and let it drinke.
185   *<S {An}.> Wherefore (sweet- heart?) What's your Meta-phor?
186   _
187    <S {Ma}.> It's dry sir.
188   *<S {And}.> Why I thinke so: I am not such an asse, but I
189    can keepe my hand dry. But what's your iest?
190    <S {Ma}.> A dry iest Sir.
191    <S {And}.> Are you full of them?
192   *<S {Ma}.> #I Sir, I haue them at my fingers ends: marry now
193    I let go your hand, I am barren.  <D {Exit Maria}>
194   *<S {To}.> O knight, thou lack'st a cup of Canarie: when did
195    I see thee so put downe?
196   *<S {An}.> Neuer in your life I thinke, vnlesse you see Ca-narie
197   *put me downe: mee thinkes sometimes I haue no
198   *more wit then a Christian, or an ordinary man ha's: but I
199   *am a great eater of beefe, and I beleeue that does harme
200    to my wit.
201    <S {To}.> No question.
202   *<S {An}.> #And I thought that, I'de forsweare it. Ile ride
203    home to morrow sir {Toby}.
204    <S {To}.> {Pur- quoy} my deere knight?
205   *<S {An}.> What is {purquoy}? Do, or not do? I would I had
206   *bestowed that time in the tongues, that I haue in fencing
207   *dancing, and beare- bayting: O had I but followed the
208    Arts.
209    <S {To}.> Then hadst thou had an excellent head of haire.
210    <S {An}.> Why, would that haue mended my haire?
211   *<S {To}.> Past question, for thou seest it will not coole my |(nature
212    <S {An}.> But it becoms me wel enough, #dost not?
213   *<S {To}.> Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaffe: & I hope
214    to see a huswife take thee between her legs, & spin it off.
215   *<S {An}.> Faith Ile home to morrow sir {Toby}, your niece wil
216   *not be seene, or if she be it's four to one, she'l none of me:
217    the Count himselfe here hard by, wooes her.
218   *<S {To}.> Shee'l none o'th Count, she'l not match aboue hir
219   *degree, neither in estate, yeares, nor wit: I haue heard her
220    swear't. Tut there's life in't man.
      <P Y3>
221   *<S {And}.> Ile stay a moneth longer. I am a fellow o'th
222   *strangest minde i'th world: I delight in Maskes and Re-uels
223    sometimes altogether.
224    <S {To}.> Art thou good at these kicke- chawses Knight?
225   *<S {And}.> As any man in Illyria, whatsoeuer he be, vnder
226   *the degree of my betters, & yet I will not compare with
227    an old man.
228    <S {To}.> What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
229    <S {And}.> Faith, I can cut a caper.
230    <S {To}.> And I can cut the Mutton too't.
231   *<S {And}.> And I thinke I haue the backe- tricke, simply as
232    strong as any man in Illyria.
233   *<S {To}.> Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore haue
234   *these gifts a Curtaine before 'em? Are they like to take
235   *dust, like mistris {Mals} picture? Why dost thou not goe
236   *to Church in a Galliard, and come home in a Carranto?
237   *My verie walke should be a Iigge: I would not so much
238   *as make water but in a Sinke- a- pace: What dooest thou
239   *meane? Is it a world to hide vertues in? I did thinke by
240   *the excellent constitution of thy legge, it was form'd vn-der
241    the starre of a Galliard.
242   *<S {And}.> #I, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
243   *dam'd colour'd stocke. Shall we sit about some Reuels?
244   *<S {To}.> What shall we do else: were we not borne vnder
245    Taurus?
246    <S {And}.> Taurus? That sides and heart.
247   *<S {To}.> No sir, it is leggs and thighes: let me see thee ca-per.
248    Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent.  <D {Exeunt}>
249    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
250    <D {Enter Valentine, and Viola in mans attire}.>
251   *<S {Val}.> If the Duke continue these fauours towards you
252   *{Cesario}, you are like to be much aduanc'd, he hath known
253    you but three dayes, and already you are no stranger.
254   *<S {Vio}.> You either feare his humour, or my negligence,
255   *that you call in question the continuance of his loue. Is
256    he inconstant sir, in his fauours. <S {Val}.> No beleeue me.
257    <D {Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants}.>
258    <S {Vio}.> I thanke you: heere comes the Count.
259    <S {Duke}.> Who saw {Cesario} hoa?
260    <S {Vio}.> On your attendance my Lord heere.
261    <S {Du}.> Stand you a- while aloofe. {Cesario},
262    Thou knowst no lesse, but all: I haue vnclasp'd
263    To thee the booke euen of my secret soule.
264    Therefore good youth, addresse thy gate vnto her,
265    Be not deni'de accesse, stand at her doores,
266    And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
267    Till thou haue audience.
268    <S {Vio}.> Sure my Noble Lord,
269    If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
270    As it is spoke, she neuer will admit me.
271    <S {Du}.> Be clamorous, and leape all ciuill bounds,
272    Rather then make vnprofited returne,
273   *<S {Vio}.> Say I do speake with her (my Lord) what then?
274    <S {Du}.> O then, vnfold the passion of my loue,
275    Surprize her with discourse of my deere faith;
276    It shall become thee well to act my woes:
277    She will attend it better in thy youth,
278    Then in a Nuntio's of more graue aspect.
279    <S {Vio}.> I thinke not so, my Lord.
280    <S {Du}.> Deere Lad, beleeue it;
281    For they shall yet belye thy happy yeeres,
282    That say thou art a man: {Dianas} lip
283    Is not more smooth, and rubious: thy small pipe
284    Is as the maidens organ, shrill, and sound,
285    And all is semblatiue a womans part.
286    I know thy constellation is right apt
287    For this affayre: some foure or fiue attend him,
288    All if you will: for I my selfe am best
289    When least in companie: prosper well in this,
290    And thou shalt liue as freely as thy Lord,
291    To call his fortunes thine.
292    <S {Vio}.> Ile do my best
293    To woe your Lady: yet a barrefull strife,
294    Who ere I woe, my selfe would be his wife.  <D {Exeunt}.>
295    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
296    <D {Enter Maria, and Clowne}.>
297   *<S {Ma}.> Nay, either tell me where thou hast bin, or I will
298   *not open my lippes so wide as a brissle may enter, in way
299    of thy excuse: my Lady will hang thee for thy absence.
300   *<S {Clo}.> Let her hang me: hee that is well hang'de in this
301    world, needs to feare no colours.
302    <S {Ma}.> Make that good.
303    <S {Clo}.> He shall see none to feare.
304   *<S {Ma}.> A good lenton answer: I can tell thee where y
305    saying was borne, of I feare no colours.
306    <S {Clo}.> Where good mistris {Mary}?
307   *<S {Ma}.> In the warrs, & that may you be bolde to say in
308    your foolerie.
309   *<S {Clo}.> Well, God giue them wisedome that haue it: &
310    those that are fooles, let them vse their talents.
311   *<S {Ma}.> Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent,
312   *or to be turn'd away: is not that as good as a hanging to
313    you?
314   *<S {Clo}.> Many a good hanging, preuents a bad marriage:
315    and for turning away, let summer beare it out.
316    <S {Ma}.> You are resolute then?
317   *<S {Clo}.> Not so neyther, but I am resolu'd on two points
318   *<S {Ma}.> That if one breake, the other will hold: or if both
319    breake, your gaskins fall.
320   *<S {Clo}.> Apt in good faith, very apt: well go thy way, if
321   *sir {Toby} would leaue drinking, thou wert as witty a piece
322    of {Eues} flesh, as any in Illyria.
323   *<S {Ma}.> Peace you rogue, no more o'that: here comes my
324    Lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
325    <D {Enter Lady Oliuia, with Maluolio}.>
326   *<S {Clo}.> Wit, and't be thy #will, put me into good fooling:
327   *those wits that thinke they haue thee, doe very oft proue
328   *fooles: and I that am sure I lacke thee, may passe for a
329   *wise man. For what saies {Quinapalus}, Better a witty foole,
330    then a foolish wit. God blesse thee Lady.
331    <S {Ol}.> Take the foole away.
332   *<S {Clo}.> Do you not heare fellowes, take away the Ladie.
333   *<S {Ol}.> Go #too, y'are a dry foole: Ile no more of you: be-sides
334    you grow dis- honest.
335   *<S {Clo}.> Two faults Madona, that drinke & good counsell
336   *wil amend: for giue the dry foole drink, then is the foole
337   *not dry: bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he mend,
338   *he is no longer dishonest; if hee cannot, let the Botcher
339   *mend him: any thing that's mended, is but patch'd: vertu
340   *that transgresses, is but patcht with sinne, and sin that a-mends,
341   *is but patcht with vertue. If that this simple
342   *Sillogisme will serue, so: if it will not, what remedy?
      <P Y3v>
343   *As there is no true Cuckold but calamity, so beauties a
344   *flower; The Lady bad take away the foole, therefore I
345    say againe, take her away.
346    <S {Ol}.> Sir, I bad them take away you.
347   *<S {Clo}.> Misprision in the highest degree. Lady, {Cucullus}
348   *{non facit monachum}: that's as much to say, as I weare not
349   *motley in my braine: good {Madona}, giue mee leaue to
350    proue you a foole.
351    <S {Ol}.> Can you do it?
352    <S {Clo}.> Dexteriously, good Madona.
353    <S {Ol}.> Make your proofe.
354   *<S {Clo}.> I must catechize you for it Madona, Good my
355    Mouse of vertue answer mee.
356   *<S {Ol}.> Well sir, for want of other idlenesse, Ile bide your
357    proofe.
358    <S {Clo}.> Good Madona, why mournst thou?
359    <S {Ol}.> Good foole, for my brothers death.
360    <S {Clo}.> I thinke his soule is in #hell, Madona.
361    <S {Ol}.> I know his soule is in heauen, foole.
362   *<S {Clo}.> The more foole (Madona) to mourne for your
363   *Brothers soule, being in heauen. Take away the Foole,
364    Gentlemen.
365   *<S {Ol}.> What thinke you of this foole {Maluolio}, doth he
366    not mend?
367   *<S {Mal}.> Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake
368   *him: Infirmity that decaies the wise, doth euer make the
369    better foole.
370   *<S {Clow}.> God send you sir, a speedie Infirmity, for the
371   *better increasing your folly: Sir {Toby} will be sworn that
372   *I am no Fox, but he wil not passe his word for two pence
373    that you are no Foole.
374    <S {Ol}.> How say you to that {Maluolio}?
375   *<S {Mal}.> I maruell your Ladyship  takes delight in such
376   *a barren rascall: I saw him put down the other day, with
377   *an ordinary foole, that has no more braine then a stone.
378   *Looke you now, he's out of his gard already: vnles you
379   *laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gag'd. I protest
380   *I take these Wisemen, that crow so at these set kinde of
381    fooles, no better then the fooles Zanies.
382   *<S {Ol}.> O you are sicke of selfe- loue {Maluolio}, and taste
383   *with a distemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltlesse,
384   *and of free disposition, is to take those things for Bird- bolts,
385   *that you deeme Cannon bullets: There is no slan-der
386   *in an allow'd foole, though he do nothing but rayle;
387   *nor no rayling, in a knowne discreet man, though hee do
388    nothing but reproue.
389   *<S {Clo}.> Now Mercury indue thee with leasing, for thou
390    speak'st well of fooles.
391    <D {Enter Maria}.>
392   *<S {Mar}.> Madam, there is at the gate, a young Gentle-man,
393    much desires to speake with you.
394    <S {Ol}.> From the Count {Orsino}, is it?
395   *<S {Ma}> I know not (Madam) 'tis a faire young man, and
396    well attended.
397    <S {Ol}.> Who of my people hold him in delay?
398    <S {Ma}.> Sir {Toby} Madam, your kinsman.
399   *<S {Ol}.> Fetch him off I pray you, he speakes nothing but
400   *madman: Fie on him. Go you {Maluolio}; If it be a suit
401   *from the Count, I am sicke, or not at home. What you
402    will, to dismisse it.  <D {Exit Maluo}.>
403   *Now you see sir, how your fooling growes old, & peo-ple
404    dislike it.
405   *<S {Clo}.> Thou hast spoke for vs (Madona) as if thy eldest
406   *sonne should be a foole: whose scull, Ioue cramme with
407    braines, for heere he comes. <D {Enter Sir Toby}.>
408    One of thy kin has a most weake {Pia- mater}.
409   *<S {Ol}.> By mine honor halfe drunke. What is he at the
410    gate Cosin?
411    <S {To}.> A Gentleman.
412    <S {Ol}.> A Gentleman? What Gentleman?
413   *<S {To}.> 'Tis a Gentleman heere. A plague o'these pickle
414    herring: How now Sot.
415    <S {Clo}.> Good Sir {Toby}.
416    <S {Ol}.> Cosin, Cosin, how haue you come so earely by
417    this Lethargie?
418   *<S {To}.> Letcherie, I defie Letchery: there's one at the
419    gate.
420    <S {Ol}.> #I marry, what is he?
421   *<S {To}.> Let him be the diuell #and he will, I care not: giue
422    me faith say I. Well, it's all one.  <D {Exit}>
423    <S {Ol}.> What's a drunken man like, foole?
424   *<S {Clo}.> Like a drown'd man, a foole, and a madde man:
425   *One draught aboue heate, makes him a foole, the second
426    maddes him, and a third drownes him.
427   *<S {Ol}.> Go thou and seeke the Crowner, and let him sitte
428   *o'my Coz: for he's in the third degree of drinke: hee's
429    drown'd: go looke after him.
430   *<S {Clo}.> He is but mad yet Madona, and the foole shall
431    looke to the madman.
432    <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
433   *<S {Mal}.> Madam, yond young fellow sweares hee will
434   *speake with you. I told him you were sicke, he takes on
435   *him to vnderstand so much, and therefore comes to speak
436   *with you. I told him you were asleepe, he seems to haue
437   *a fore knowledge of that too, and therefore comes to
438   *speake with you. What is to be said to him Ladie, hee's
439    fortified against any deniall.
440    <S {Ol}.> Tell him, he shall not speake with me.
441   *<S {Mal}.> #Ha's beene told so: and hee sayes hee'l stand at
442   *your doore like a Sheriffes post, and be the supporter to
443    a bench, but hee'l speake with you.
444    <S {Ol}.> What kinde o'man is he?
445    <S {Mal}.> Why of mankinde.
446    <S {Ol}.> What manner of man?
447   *<S {Mal}.> Of verie #ill manner: hee'l speake with you, will
448    you, or no.
449    <S {Ol}.> Of what personage, and yeeres is he?
450   *<S {Mal}.> Not yet old enough for a man, nor yong enough
451   *for a boy: as a squash is before tis a pescod, or a Codling
452   *when tis almost an Apple: Tis with him in standing wa-ter,
453   *betweene boy and man. He is verie well- fauour'd,
454   *and he speakes verie shrewishly: One would thinke his
455    mothers milke were scarse out of him.
456    <S {Ol}.> Let him approach: Call in my Gentlewoman.
457    <S {Mal}.> Gentlewoman, my Lady calles.  <D {Exit}.>
458    <D {Enter Maria}.>
459    <S {Ol}.> Giue me my vaile: come throw it ore my face,
460    Wee'l once more heare {Orsinos} Embassie.
461    <D {Enter Violenta}.>
462   *<S {Vio}.> The honorable Ladie of the house, which is she?
463    <S {Ol}.> Speake to me, I shall answer for her: your #will.
464   *<S {Vio}.> Most radiant, exquisite, and vnmatchable beau-tie.
465   *I pray you tell me if this bee the Lady of the house,
466   *for I neuer saw her. I would bee loath to cast away my
467   *speech: for besides that it is excellently well pend, I haue
468   *taken great paines to con it. Good Beauties, let mee su-staine
469   *no scorne; I am very comptible, euen to the least
470    sinister vsage.
471    <S {Ol}.> Whence came you sir?
472   *<S {Vio}.> I can say little more then I haue studied, & that
473   *question's out of my part. Good gentle one, giue mee
474   *modest assurance, if you be the Ladie of the house, that | I
      <P Y4>
475    may proceede in my speech.
476    <S {Ol}.> Are you a Comedian?
477   *<S {Vio}.> No my profound heart: and yet (by the verie
478   *phangs of malice, I sweare) I am not that I play. Are you
479    the Ladie of the house?
480    <S {Ol}.> If I do not vsurpe my selfe, I am.
481   *<S {Vio}.> Most certaine, if you are she, you do vsurp your
482   *selfe: for what is yours to bestowe, is, not yours to re-serue.
483   *But this is from my Commission: I will on with
484   *my speech in your praise, and then shew you the heart of
485    my message.
486    <S {Ol}.> Come to what is important in't: I forgiue you
487    the praise.
488   *<S {Vio}.> Alas, I tooke great paines to studie it, and 'tis
489    Poeticall.
490   *<S {Ol}.> It is the more like to be feigned, I pray you keep
491   *it in. I heard you were sawcy at my gates, & allowd your
492   *approach rather to wonder at you, then to heare you. If
493   *you be not mad, be gone: if you haue reason, be breefe:
494   *'tis not that time of Moone with me, to make one in so
495    skipping a dialogue.
496    <S {Ma}.> Will you hoyst sayle sir, here lies your way.
497   *<S {Vio}.> No good swabber, I am to hull here a little lon-ger.
498   *Some mollification for your Giant, sweete Ladie;
499    tell me your minde, I am a messenger.
500   *<S {Ol}.> Sure you haue some hiddeous matter to deliuer,
501   *when the curtesie of it is so fearefull. Speake your office.
502   *<S {Vio}.> It alone concernes your eare: I bring no ouer-ture
503   *of warre, no taxation of homage; I hold the Olyffe
504    in my hand: my words are as full of peace, as matter.
505    <S {Ol}.> Yet you began rudely. What are you?
506    What would you?
507   *<S {Vio}.> The rudenesse that hath appear'd in mee, haue I
508   *learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
509   *would, are as secret as maiden- head: to your eares, Di-uinity;
510    to any others, prophanation.
511    <S {Ol}.> Giue vs the place alone,
512   *We will heare this diuinitie. Now sir, what is your text?
513    <S {Vio}.> Most sweet Ladie.
514   *<S {Ol}.> A comfortable doctrine, and much may bee saide
515    of it. Where lies your Text?
516    <S {Vio}.> In {Orsinoes} bosome.
517    <S {Ol}.> In his bosome? In what chapter of his bosome?
518   *<S {Vio}.> To answer by the method, in the first of his hart.
519   *<S {Ol}.> O, I haue read it: it is heresie. Haue you no more
520    to say?
521    <S {Vio}.> Good Madam, let me see your face.
522   *<S {Ol}.> Haue you any Commission from your Lord, to
523   *negotiate with my face: you are now out of your Text:
524   *but we will draw the Curtain, and shew you the picture.
525   *Looke you sir, such a one I was this present: Ist not well
526    done?
527    <S {Vio}.> Excellently done, if God did all.
528   *<S {Ol}.> 'Tis in graine sir, 'twill endure winde and wea-ther.
529   _
530    <S {Vio}.> Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white,
531    Natures owne sweet, and cunning hand laid on:
532    Lady, you are the cruell'st #shee aliue,
533    If you will leade these graces to the graue,
534    And leaue the world no copie.
535   *<S {Ol}.> O sir, I will not be so hard- hearted: I will giue
536   *out diuers scedules of my beautie. It shalbe Inuentoried
537   *and euery particle and vtensile labell'd to my #will: As,
538   *Item two lippes indifferent redde, Item two grey eyes,
539   *with lids to them: Item, one necke, one chin, & so forth.
540    Were you sent hither to praise me?
541    <S {Vio}.> I see you what you are, you are too proud:
542    But if you were the diuell, you are faire:
543    My Lord, and master loues you: O such loue
544    Could be but recompenc'd, though you were crown'd
545    The non- pareil of beautie.
546    <S {Ol}.> How does he loue me?
547    <S {Vio}.> With adorations, fertill teares,
548    With groanes that thunder loue, with sighes of fire.
549   *<S {Ol}.> Your Lord does know my mind, I cannot loue him
550    Yet I suppose him vertuous, know him noble,
551    Of great estate, of fresh and stainlesse youth;
552    In voyces well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant,
553    And in dimension, and the shape of nature,
554    A gracious person; But yet I cannot loue him:
555    He might haue tooke his answer long ago.
556    <S {Vio}.> If I did loue you in my masters flame,
557    With such a  suffring, such a deadly life:
558    In your deniall, I would finde no sence,
559    I would not vnderstand it.
560    <S {Ol}.> Why, what would you?
561    <S {Vio}.> Make me a willow Cabine at your gate,
562    And call vpon my soule within the house,
563    Write loyall Cantons of contemned loue,
564    And sing them lowd euen in the dead of night:
565    Hallow your name to the reuerberate hilles,
566    And make the babling Gossip of the aire,
567    Cry out {Oliuia}: O you should not rest
568    Betweene the elements of ayre, and earth,
569    But you should pittie me.
570    <S {Ol}.> You might do much:
571    What is your Parentage?
572    <S {Vio}.> Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well:
573    I am a Gentleman.
574    <S {Ol}.> Get you to your Lord:
575    I cannot loue him: let him send no more,
576    Vnlesse (perchance) you come to me againe,
577    To tell me how he takes it: Fare you well:
578    I thanke you for your paines: spend this for mee.
579    <S {Vio}.> I am no feede poast, Lady; keepe your purse,
580    My Master, not my selfe, lackes recompence.
581    Loue make his heart of flint, that you shal loue,
582    And let your feruour like my masters be,
583    Plac'd in contempt: Farwell fayre crueltie.  <D {Exit}>
584    <S {Ol}.> What is your Parentage?
585    Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well;
586    I am a Gentleman. Ile be sworne thou art,
587    Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbes, actions, and spirit,
588    Do giue thee fiue- fold blazon: not too fast: soft, soft,
589    Vnlesse the Master were the man. How now?
590    Euen so quickly may one catch the plague?
591    Me thinkes I feele this youths perfections
592    With an inuisible, and subtle stealth
593    To creepe in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
594    What hoa, {Maluolio}.
595    <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
596    <S {Mal}.> Heere Madam, at your seruice.
597    <S {Ol}.> Run after that same peeuish Messenger
598    The Countes man: he left this Ring behinde him
599    Would I, or not: tell him, Ile none of it.
600    Desire him not to flatter with his Lord,
601    Nor hold him vp with hopes, I am not for him:
602    If that the youth will come this way to morrow,
603    Ile giue him reasons for't: hie thee {Maluolio}.
604    <S {Mal}.> Madam, I will.  <D {Exit}.>
605    <S {Ol}.> I do I know not what, and feare to finde
606    Mine eye too great a flatterer for my minde:
      <P Y4v>
607    Fate, shew thy force, our selues we do not owe,
608    What is decreed, must be: #and be this so.
609    <Z {Finis, Actus primus}.>
610    <Z {Actus Secundus, Scaena prima}.>
611    <D {Enter Antonio & Sebastian}.>
612   *<S {Ant}.> Will you stay no longer: nor will you not that
613    I go with you.
614   *<S {Seb}.> By your patience, no: my starres shine darkely
615   *ouer me; the malignancie of my fate, might perhaps di-stemper
616   *yours; therefore I shall craue of you your leaue,
617   *that I may beare my euils alone. It were a bad recom-pence
618    for your loue, to lay any of them on you.
619   *<S {An}.> Let me yet know of you, whither you are bound.
620   *<S {Seb}.> No sooth sir: my determinate voyage is meere
621   *extrauagancie. But I perceiue in you so excellent a touch
622   *of modestie, that you will not extort from me, what I am
623   *willing to keepe in: therefore it charges me in manners,
624   *the rather to expresse my selfe: you must know of mee
625   *then {Antonio}, my name is {Sebastian} (which I call'd {Rodo-rigo})
626   *my father was that {Sebastian} of {Messaline}, whom I
627   *know you haue heard of. He left behinde him, my selfe,
628   *and a sister, both borne in an houre: if the Heauens had
629   *beene pleas'd, would we had so ended. But you sir, al-ter'd
630   *that, for some houre before you tooke me from the
631    breach of the sea, was my sister drown'd.
632    <S {Ant}.> Alas the day.
633   *<S {Seb}.> A Lady sir, though it was said shee much resem-bled
634   *me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but thogh
635   *I could not with such estimable wonder ouer- farre be-leeue
636   *that, yet thus farre I will boldly publish her, shee
637   *bore a minde that enuy could not but call faire: Shee is
638   *drown'd already sir with salt water, though I seeme to
639    drowne her remembrance againe with more.
640    <S {Ant}.> Pardon me sir, your bad entertainment.
641    <S {Seb}.> O good {Antonio}, forgiue me your trouble.
642   *<S {Ant}.> If you will not murther me for my loue, let mee
643    be your seruant.
644   *<S {Seb}.> If you will not vndo what you haue done, that is
645   *kill him, whom you haue recouer'd, desire it not. Fare
646   *ye well at once, my bosome is full of kindnesse, and I
647   *am yet so neere the manners of my mother, that vpon the
648   *least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me: I am
649    bound to the Count Orsino's Court, farewell.  <D {Exit}>
650    <S {Ant}.> The gentlenesse of all the gods go with thee:
651    I haue many enemies in Orsino's Court,
652    Else would I very shortly see thee there:
653    But come what may, I do adore thee so,
654    That danger shall seeme sport, and I will go.  <D {Exit}.>
655    <Z {Scaena Secunda}.>
656    <D {Enter Viola and Maluolio, at seuerall doores}.>
657   *<S {Mal}.> Were not you eu'n now, with the Countesse {O-liuia}?
658   _
659   *<S {Vio}.> Euen now sir, on a moderate pace, I haue since a-riu'd
660    but hither.
661   *<S {Mal}.> She returnes this Ring to you (sir) you might
662   *haue saued mee my paines, to haue taken it away your
663   *selfe. She adds moreouer, that you should put your Lord
664   *into a desperate assurance, she will none of him. And one
665   *thing more, that you be neuer so hardie to come againe
666   *in his affaires, vnlesse it bee to report your Lords taking
667    of this: receiue it so.
668    <S {Vio}.> She tooke the Ring of me, Ile none of it.
669   *<S {Mal}.> Come sir, you peeuishly threw it to her: and
670   *her #will is, it should be so return'd: If it bee worth stoo-ping
671   *for, there it lies, in your eye: if not, bee it his that
672    findes it.  <D {Exit}.>
673   *<S {Vio}.> I left no Ring with her: what meanes this Lady?
674    Fortune forbid my out- side haue not charm'd her:
675    She made good view of me, indeed so much,
676    That me thought her eyes had lost her tongue,
677    For she did speake in starts distractedly.
678    She loues me sure, the cunning of her passion
679    Inuites me in this churlish messenger:
680    None of my Lords Ring? Why he sent her none;
681    I am the man, if it be so, as tis,
682    Poore Lady, she were better loue a dreame:
683    Disguise, I see thou art a wickednesse,
684    Wherein the pregnant enemie does much.
685    How easie is it, for the proper false
686    In womens waxen hearts to set their formes:
687    Alas, O frailtie is the cause, not wee,
688    For such as we are made, if such we bee:
689    How will this fadge? My master loues her deerely,
690    And I (poore monster) fond asmuch on him:
691    And she (mistaken) seemes to dote on me:
692    What will become of this? As I am man,
693    My state is desperate for my maisters loue:
694    As I am woman (now alas the day)
695    What thriftlesse sighes shall poore {Oliuia} breath?
696    O time, thou must vntangle this, not I,
697    It is too hard a knot for me t' vnty.
698    <Z {Scoena Tertia}.>
699    <D {Enter Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew}.>
700   *<S {To}.> Approach Sir {Andrew}: not to bee #a bedde after
701   *midnight, is to be vp betimes, and {Deliculo surgere}, thou
702    know'st.
703   *<S {And}.> Nay by my troth I know not: but I know, to
704    be vp late, is to be vp late.
705   *<S {To}.> A false conclusion: I hate it as an vnfill'd Canne.
706   *To be vp after midnight, and to go to bed then is early:
707   *so that to go to bed after midnight, is to goe to bed be-times.
708   *Does not our liues consist of the foure Ele-ments?
709   _
710   *<S {And}.> Faith so they say, but I thinke it rather consists
711    of eating and drinking.
712   *<S {To}.> Th'art a scholler; let vs therefore eate and drinke
713    {Marian} I say, a stoope of wine.

716   *<S {Clo}.> How now my harts: Did you neuer see the Pic-ture
717    of we three?
718    <S {To}.> Welcome asse, now let's haue a catch.
719   *<S {And}.> By my troth the foole has an excellent breast. I
720   *had rather then forty shillings I had such a legge, and so
721   *sweet a breath to sing, as the foole has. Insooth thou wast
722   *in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spok'st of
723   *{Pigrogromitus}, of the {Vapians} passing the Equinoctial of
724   *{Queubus}: 'twas very good yfaith: I sent thee sixe pence
      <P Y5>
725    for thy Lemon, hadst it?
726   *<S {Clo}.> I did impeticos thy gratillity: for {Maluolios} nose
727   *is no Whip- stocke. My Lady has a white hand, and the
728    Mermidons are no bottle- ale houses.
729   *<S {An}.> Excellent: Why this is the best fooling, when
730    all is done. Now a song.
731   *<S {To}.> Come on, there is sixe pence for you. Let's haue
732    a song.
733   *<S {An}.> There's a testrill of me too: if one knight giue a
734   *<S {Clo}.> Would you haue a loue- song, or a song of good
735    life?
736    <S {To}.> A loue song, a loue song.
737    <S {An}.> #I, #I. I care not for good life.
738    <S {Clowne sings}>.
739    {O Mistris mine where are you roming?}
740    {O stay and heare, your true loues coming},
741    {That can sing both high and low}.
742    {Trip no further prettie sweeting}.
743    {Iourneys end in louers meeting},
744    {Euery wise mans sonne doth know}.
745    <S {An}.> Excellent good, ifaith.
746    <S {To}.> Good, good.
747    <S {Clo}.> {What is loue, tis not heereafter},
748    {Present mirth, hath present laughter:}
749    {What's to come, is still vnsure}.
750    {In delay there lies no plentie},
751    {Then come kisse me sweet and twentie:}
752    {Youths a stuffe will not endure}.
753    <S {An}.> A mellifluous voyce, as I am true knight.
754    <S {To}.> A contagious breath.
755    <S {An}.> Very sweet, and contagious ifaith.
756    <S {To}.> To heare by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
757   *But shall we make the Welkin dance indeed? Shall wee
758   *rowze the night- Owle in a Catch, that will drawe three
759    soules out of one Weauer? Shall we do that?
760   *<S {And}.> #And you loue me, let's doo't: I am dogge at a
761    Catch.
762    <S {Clo}.> Byrlady sir, and some dogs will catch well.
763    <S {An}.> Most certaine: Let our Catch be, {Thou Knaue}.
764   *<S {Clo}.> {Hold thy peace, thou Knaue} knight. I shall be con-strain'd
765    in't, to call thee knaue, Knight.
766    <S {An}.> 'Tis not the first time I haue constrained one to
767    call me knaue. Begin foole: it begins, {Hold thy peace}.
768    <S {Clo}.> I shall neuer begin if I hold my peace.
769    <S {An}.> Good ifaith: Come begin.  <D {Catch sung}>
770    <D {Enter Maria}.>
771   *<S {Mar}.> What a catterwalling doe you keepe heere? If
772   *my Ladie haue not call'd vp her Steward {Maluolio}, and
773    bid him turne you out of doores, neuer trust me.
774   *<S {To}.> My Lady's a {Catayan}, we are politicians, {Maluolio}s
775   *a Peg- a- ramsie, and {Three merry men be wee}. Am not I
776   *consanguinious? Am I not of her blood: tilly vally. La-die,
777    {There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady, Lady}.
778    <S {Clo}.> Beshrew me, the knights in admirable fooling.
779   *<S {An}.> #I, he do's well enough if he be dispos'd, and so
780   *do I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it more
781    naturall.
782    <S {To}.> {O the twelfe day of December}.
783    <S {Mar}.> For the loue #o' God peace.
784    <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
785   *<S {Mal}.> My masters are you mad? Or what are you?
786   *Haue you no wit, manners, nor honestie, but to gabble
787   *like Tinkers at this time of night? Do yee make an Ale-house
788   *of my Ladies house, that ye squeak out your Cozi-ers
789   *Catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice?
790    Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?
791   *<S {To}.> We did keepe time sir in our Catches. Snecke vp.
792   *<S {Mal}.> {Sir Toby}, I must be round with you. My Lady
793   *bad me tell you, that though she harbors you as her kins-man,
794   *she's nothing ally'd to your disorders. If you can
795   *separate your selfe and your misdemeanors, you are wel-come
796   *to the house: if not, and it would please you to take
797    leaue of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.
798   *<S {To}.> Farewell deere heart, since I must needs be gone.
799    <S {Mar}.> Nay good Sir {Toby}.
800    <S {Clo}.> His eyes do shew his dayes are almost done.
801    <S {Mal}.> Is't euen so?
802    <S {To}.> But I will neuer dye.
803    <S {Clo}.> Sir {Toby} there you lye.
804    <S {Mal}.> This is much credit to you.
805    <S {To}.> {Shall I bid him go}.
806    <S {Clo}.> {What #and if you do?}
807    <S {To}.> {Shall I bid him go, and spare not?}
808    <S {Clo}.> {O no, no, no, no, you dare not}.
809   *<S {To}.> Out #o' tune sir, ye lye: Art any more then a Stew-ard?
810   *Dost thou thinke because thou art vertuous, there
811    shall be no more Cakes and Ale?
812   *<S {Clo}.> Yes by {S[aint]}. Anne, and Ginger shall bee hotte y'th
813    mouth too.
814   *<S {To}.> Th'art i'th right. Goe sir, rub your Chaine with
815    crums. A stope of Wine {Maria}.
816   *<S {Mal}.> Mistris Mary, if you priz'd my Ladies fauour
817   *at any thing more then contempt, you would not giue
818   *meanes for this vnciuill rule; she shall know of it by this
819    hand.  <D {Exit}>
820    <S {Mar}.> Go shake your eares.
821   *<S {An}.> 'Twere as good a deede as to drink when a mans
822   *#a hungrie, to challenge him the field, and then to breake
823    promise with him, and make a foole of him.
824   *<S {To}.> Doo't knight, Ile write thee a Challenge: or Ile
825    deliuer thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
826   *<S {Mar}.> Sweet Sir Toby be patient for  to night: Since
827   *the youth of the Counts was to day with my Lady, she is
828   *much out of quiet. For Monsieur Maluolio, let me alone
829   *with him: If I do not gull him into a nayword, and make
830   *him a common recreation, do not thinke I haue witte e-nough
831    to lye straight in my bed: I know I can do it.
832   *<S {To}.> Possesse vs, possesse vs, tell vs something of him.
833   *<S {Mar}.> Marrie sir, sometimes he is a kinde of Puritane.
834   *<S {An}.> O, if I thought that, Ide beate him like a dogge.
835   *<S {To}.> What for being a Puritan, thy exquisite reason,
836    deere knight.
837   *<S {An}.> I haue no exquisite reason for't, but I haue reason
838    good enough.
839   *<S {Mar}.> The diu'll a Puritane that hee is, or any thing
840   *constantly but a time- pleaser, an affection'd Asse, that
841   *cons State without booke, and vtters it by great swarths.
842   *The best perswaded of himselfe: so cram'd (as he thinkes)
843   *with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith, that all
844   *that looke on him, loue him: and on that vice in him, will
845    my reuenge finde notable cause to worke.
846    <S {To}.> What wilt thou do?
847   *<S {Mar}.> I will drop in his way some obscure Epistles of
848   *loue, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his
849   *legge, the manner of his gate, the expressure of his eye,
850   *forehead, and complection, he shall finde himselfe most
851   *feelingly personated. I can write very like my Ladie
852   *your Neece, on a forgotten matter wee can hardly make
853    distinction of our hands.
854    <S {To}.> Excellent, I smell a deuice.
855    <S {An}.> I hau't in my nose too.
856   *<S {To}.> He shall thinke by the Letters that thou wilt drop
      <P Y5v>
857   *that they come from my Neece, and that shee's in loue
858    with him.
859    <S {Mar}.> My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.
860    <S {An}.> And your horse now would make him an Asse.
861    <S {Mar}.> Asse, I doubt not.
862    <S {An}.> O twill be admirable.
863   *<S {Mar}.> Sport royall I warrant you: I know my Phy-sicke
864   *will worke with him, I will plant you two, and let
865   *the Foole make a third, where he shall finde the Letter:
866   *obserue his construction of it: For this night to bed, and
867    dreame on the euent: Farewell.  <D {Exit}>
868    <S {To}.> Good night {Penthisilea}.
869    <S {An}.> Before me she's a good wench.
870   *<S {To}.> She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores me:
871    what o'that?
872    <S {An}.> I was ador'd once too.
873   *<S {To}.> Let's to bed knight: Thou hadst neede send for
874    more money.
875   *<S {An}.> If I cannot recouer your Neece, I am a foule way
876    out.
877   *<S {To}.> Send for money knight, if thou hast her not i'th
878    end, call me Cut.
879   *<S {An}.> If I do not, neuer trust me, take it how you will.
880   *<S {To}.> Come, come, Ile go burne some Sacke, tis too late
881    to go to bed now: Come knight, come knight.  <D {Exeunt}>
882    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
883    <D {Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and others}.>
884   *<S {Du}.> Giue me some Musick; Now good morow frends.
885    Now good {Cesario}, but that peece of song,
886    That old and Anticke song we heard last night;
887    Me thought it did releeue my passion much,
888    More then light ayres, and recollected termes
889    Of these most briske  and giddy- paced times.
890    Come, but one verse.
891   *<S {Cur}.> He is not heere (so please your Lordshippe) that
892    should sing it?
893    <S {Du}.> Who was it?
894   *<S {Cur}.> {Feste} the Iester my Lord, a foole that the Ladie
895   *{Oliuiaes} Father tooke much delight in. He is about the
896    house.
897    <S {Du}.> Seeke him out, and play the tune the while.
898    <D {Musicke playes}.>
899    Come hither Boy, if euer thou shalt loue
900    In the sweet pangs of it, remember me:
901    For such as I am, all true Louers are,
902    Vnstaid and skittish in all motions else,
903    Saue in the constant image of the creature
904    That is belou'd. How dost thou like this tune?
905    <S {Vio}.> It giues a verie eccho to the seate
906    Where loue is thron'd.
907    <S {Du}.> Thou dost speake masterly,
908    My life vpon't, yong though thou art, thine eye
909    Hath staid vpon some fauour that it loues:
910    Hath it not boy?
911    <S {Vio}.> A little, by your fauour.
912    <S {Du}.> What kinde of woman ist?
913    <S {Vio}.> Of your complection.
914   *<S {Du}.> She is not worth thee then. What yeares ifaith?
915    <S {Vio}.> About your yeeres my Lord.
916    <S {Du}.> Too old by heauen: Let still the woman take
917    An elder then her selfe, so weares she to him;
918    So swayes she leuell in her husbands heart:
919    For boy, howeuer we do praise our selues,
920    Our fancies are more giddie and vnfirme,
921    More longing, wauering, sooner lost and worne,
922    Then womens are.
923    <S {Vio}.> I thinke it well my Lord.
924    <S {Du}.> Then let thy Loue be yonger then thy selfe,
925    Or thy affection cannot hold the bent:
926    For women are as Roses, whose faire flowre
927    Being once displaid, doth fall that verie howre.
928    <S {Vio}.> And so they are: alas, that they are so:
929    To die, euen when they to perfection grow.
930    <D {Enter Curio & Clowne}.>
931    <S {Du}.> O fellow come, the song we had last night:
932    Marke it Cesario, it is old and plaine;
933    The Spinsters and the Knitters in the Sun,
934    And the free maides that weaue their thred with bones,
935    Do vse to chaunt it: it is silly sooth,
936    And dallies with the innocence of loue,
937    Like the old age.
938    <S {Clo}.> Are you ready Sir?
939    <S {Duke}.> #I prethee sing.  <D {Musicke}.>
940    <D {The Song}.>
941    {Come away, come away death},
942    {#And in sad cypresse let me be laide}.
943    {Fye away, fie away breath},
944    {I am slaine by a faire cruell maide:}
945   *{My shrowd of white, stuck all with Ew, O prepare it}.
946    {My part of death no one so true did share it}.
947    {Not a flower, not a flower sweete}
948    {On my blacke coffin, let there be strewne:}
949    {Not a friend, not a friend greet}
950    {My poore corpes, where my bones shall be throwne:}
951   *{A thousand thousand sighes to saue, lay me o where}
952   *{Sad true louer neuer find my graue, to weepe there}.
953    <S {Du}.> There's for thy paines.
954    <S {Clo}.> No paines sir, I take pleasure in singing sir.
955    <S {Du}.> Ile pay thy pleasure then.
956   *<S {Clo}.> Truely sir, and pleasure will be paide one time, or
957    another.
958    <S {Du}.> Giue me now leaue, to leaue thee.
959   *<S {Clo}.> Now the melancholly God protect thee, and the
960   *Tailor make thy doublet of changeable Taffata, for thy
961   *minde is a very Opall. I would haue men of such constan-cie
962   *put to Sea, that their businesse might be euery thing,
963   *and their intent euerie where, for that's it, that alwayes
964    makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.  <D {Exit}>
965    <S {Du}.> Let all the rest giue place: Once more {Cesario},
966    Get thee to yond same soueraigne crueltie:
967    Tell her my loue, more noble then the world
968    Prizes not quantitie of dirtie lands,
969    The parts that fortune hath bestow'd vpon her:
970    Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune:
971    But 'tis that miracle, and Queene of Iems
972    That nature prankes her in, attracts my soule.
973    <S {Vio}.> But if she cannot loue you sir.
974    <S {Du}.> It cannot be so answer'd.
975    <S {Vio}.> Sooth but you must.
976    Say that some Lady, as perhappes there is,
977    Hath for your loue as great a pang of heart
978    As you haue for {Oliuia}: you cannot loue her:
979    You tel her so: Must she not then be answer'd?
980    <S {Du}.> There is no womans sides
      <P Y6>
981    Can bide the beating of so strong a passion,
982    As loue doth giue my heart: no womans heart
983    So bigge, to hold so much, they lacke retention.
984    Alas, their loue may be call'd appetite,
985    No motion of the Liuer, but the Pallat,
986    That suffer surfet, cloyment, and reuolt,
987    But mine is all as hungry as the Sea,
988    And can digest as much, make no compare
989    Betweene that loue a woman can beare me,
990    And that I owe {Oliuia}.
991    <S {Vio}.> #I but I know.
992    <S {Du}.> What dost thou knowe?
993    <S {Vio}.> Too well what loue women to men may owe:
994    In faith they are as true of heart, as we.
995    My Father had a daughter lou'd a man
996    As it might be perhaps, were I a woman
997    I should your Lordship.
998    <S {Du}.> And what's her history?
999    <S {Vio}.> A blanke my Lord: she neuer told her loue,
1000   But let concealment like a worme i'th budde
1001   Feede on her damaske cheeke: she pin'd in thought,
1002   And with a greene and yellow melancholly,
1003   She sate like Patience on a Monument,
1004   Smiling at greefe. Was not this loue indeede?
1005   We men may say more, sweare more, but indeed
1006   Our shewes are more then #will: for still we proue
1007   Much in our vowes, but little in our loue.
1008   <S {Du}.> But di'de thy sister of her loue my Boy?
1009   <S {Vio}.> I am all the daughters of my Fathers house,
1010   And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
1011   Sir, shall I to this Lady?
1012   <S {Du}.> #I that's the Theame,
1013   To her in haste: giue her this Iewell: say,
1014   My loue can giue no place, bide no denay.  <D {exeunt}>
1015   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
1016   <D {Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian}.>
1017   <S {To}.> Come thy wayes Signior {Fabian}.
1018   <S {Fab}.> Nay Ile come: if I loose a scruple of this sport,
1019   let me be boyl'd to death with Melancholly.
1020  *<S {To}.> Wouldst thou not be glad to haue the niggard-ly
1021   Rascally sheepe- biter, come by some notable shame?
1022  *<S {Fa}.> I would exult man: you know he brought me out
1023   #o' fauour  with my Lady, about a Beare- baiting heere.
1024  *<S {To}.> To anger him wee'l haue the Beare againe, and
1025  *we will foole him blacke and blew, shall we not sir {An-drew}?
1026  _
1027   <S {An}.> #And we do not, it is pittie of our liues.
1028   <D {Enter Maria}.>
1029   <S {To}.> Heere comes the little villaine: How now my
1030   Mettle of India?
1031  *<S {Mar}.> Get ye all three into the box tree: {Maluolio}'s
1032  *comming downe this walke, he has beene yonder i'the
1033  *Sunne practising behauiour to his own shadow this halfe
1034  *houre: obserue him for the loue of Mockerie: for I know
1035  *this Letter wil make a contemplatiue Ideot of him. Close
1036  *in the name of ieasting, lye thou there: for heere comes
1037   the Trowt, that must be caught with tickling. <D {Exit}>
1038   <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
1039  *<S {Mal}.> 'Tis but Fortune, all is fortune. {Maria} once
1040  *told me she did affect me, and I haue heard her self come
1041  *thus neere, that should shee fancie, it should bee one of
1042  *my complection. Besides she vses me with a more ex-alted
1043  *respect, then any one else that followes her. What
1044   should I thinke on't?
1045   <S {To}.> Heere's an ouer- weening rogue.
1046  *<S {Fa}.> Oh peace: Contemplation makes a rare Turkey
1047   Cocke of him, how he iets vnder his aduanc'd plumes.
1048   <S {And}.> Slight I could so beate the Rogue.
1049   <S {To}.> Peace I say.
1050   <S {Mal}.> To be Count {Maluolio}.
1051   <S {To}.> Ah Rogue.
1052   <S {An}.> Pistoll him, pistoll him.
1053   <S {To}.> Peace, peace.
1054  *<S {Mal}.> There is example for't: The Lady of the {Stra-chy},
1055   married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
1056   <S {An}.> Fie on him Iezabel.
1057  *<S {Fa}.> O peace, now he's deepely in: looke how imagi-nation
1058   blowes him.
1059   <S {Mal}.> Hauing beene three moneths married to her,
1060   sitting in my state.
1061   <S {To}.> O for a stone- bow to hit him in the eye.
1062  *<S {Mal}.> Calling my Officers about me, in my branch'd
1063  *Veluet gowne: hauing come from a day bedde, where I
1064   haue left {Oliuia} sleeping.
1065   <S {To}.> Fire and Brimstone.
1066   <S {Fa}.> O peace, peace.
1067  *<S {Mal}.> And then to haue the humor of state: and after
1068  *a demure trauaile of regard: telling them I knowe my
1069  *place, as I would they should doe theirs: to aske for my
1070   kinsman {Toby}.
1071   <S {To}.> Boltes and shackles.
1072   <S {Fa}.> Oh peace, peace, peace, now, now.
1073  *<S {Mal}.> Seauen of my people with an obedient start,
1074  *make out for him: I frowne the while, and perchance
1075  *winde vp my watch, or play with my some rich Iewell:
1076   {Toby} approaches; curtsies there to me.
1077   <S {To}.> Shall this fellow liue?
1078  *<S {Fa}.> Though our silence be drawne from vs with cars,
1079   yet peace.
1080  *<S {Mal}.> I extend my hand to him thus: quenching my
1081   familiar smile with an austere regard of controll.
1082  *<S {To}.> And do's not {Toby} take you a blow o'the lippes,
1083   then?
1084  *<S {Mal}.> Saying, Cosine {Toby}, my Fortunes hauing cast
1085   me on your Neece, giue me this prerogatiue of speech.
1086   <S {To}.> What, what?
1087   <S {Mal}.> You must amend your drunkennesse.
1088   <S {To}.> Out scab.
1089   <S {Fab}.> Nay patience, or we breake the sinewes of our
1090   plot?
1091   <S {Mal}.> Besides you waste the treasure of your time,
1092   with a foolish knight.
1093   <S {And}.> That's mee I warrant you.
1094   <S {Mal}.> One sir {Andrew}.
1095   <S {And}.> I knew 'twas I, for many do call mee foole.
1096   <S {Mal}.> What employment haue we heere?
1097   <S {Fa}.> Now is the Woodcocke neere the gin.
1098  *<S {To}.> Oh peace, and the spirit of humors intimate rea-ding
1099   aloud to him.
1100  *<S {Mal}.> By my life this is my Ladies hand: these bee her
1101  *very {C's}, her {#V's}, and her {T's}, and thus makes shee her
1102   great {P's}. It is in contempt of question her hand.
1103   <S {An}.> Her {C's}, her {#V's}, and her {T's}: why that?
1104  *<S {Mal}.> {To the vnknowne belou'd, this, and my good Wishes}:
1105  *Her very Phrases: By your leaue wax. Soft, and the im-pressure
1106  *her {Lucrece}, with which she vses to seale: tis my
1107   Lady: To whom should this be?
1108   <S {Fab}.> This winnes him, Liuer and all.
      <P Y6v>
1109  *<S {Mal}.> {Ioue knowes I loue, but who, Lips do not mooue, no}
1110  *{man must know}. No man must know. What followes?
1111   The numbers alter'd: No man must know,
1112   If this should be thee {Maluolio}?
1113   <S {To}.> Marrie hang thee brocke.
1114  *<S {Mal}.> {I may command where I adore, but silence like a Lu-cresse}
1115   {knife:}
1116  *{With bloodlesse stroke my heart doth gore, M.O.A.I. doth}
1117   {sway my life}.
1118   <S {Fa}.> A fustian riddle.
1119   <S {To}.> Excellent Wench, say I.
1120  *<S {Mal}.> {M.O.A.I}. doth sway my life. Nay but first
1121   let me see, let me see, let me see.
1122   <S {Fab}.> What dish #a poyson has she drest him?
1123   <S {To}.> And with what wing the stallion checkes at it?
1124  *<S {Mal}.> {I may command, where I adore}: Why shee may
1125  *command me: I serue her, she is my Ladie. Why this is
1126  *euident to any formall capacitie. There is no obstruction
1127  *in this, and the end: What should that Alphabeticall po-sition
1128  *portend, if I could make that resemble  something
1129   in me? Softly, {M.O.A.I}.
1130   <S {To}.> O #I, make vp that, he is now at a cold sent.
1131  *<S {Fab}.> Sowter will cry vpon't for all this, though it bee
1132   as ranke as a Fox.
1133   <S {Mal}.> {M}. {Maluolio}, {M}. why that begins my name.
1134  *<S {Fab}.> Did not I say he would worke it out, the Curre
1135   is excellent at faults.
1136  *<S {Mal}.> {M}. But then there is no consonancy in the sequell
1137  *that suffers vnder probation: {#A}. should follow, but {#O}.
1138   does.
1139   <S {Fa}.> And {#O} shall end, I hope.
1140   <S {To}.> #I, or Ile cudgell him, and make him cry {O}.
1141   <S {Mal}.> And then {#I}. comes behind.
1142  *<S {Fa}.> #I, #and you had any eye behinde you, you might
1143  *see more detraction at your heeles, then Fortunes before
1144   you.
1145  *<S {Mal}.> {M,O,A,I}. This simulation is not as the former:
1146  *and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to mee, for e-uery
1147  *one of these Letters are in my name. Soft, here fol-lowes
1148  *prose: {If this fall into thy hand, reuolue}. In my stars
1149  *I am aboue thee, but be not affraid of greatnesse: Some
1150  *are become great, some atcheeues greatnesse, and some
1151  *haue greatnesse thrust vppon em. Thy fates open theyr
1152  *hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them, and to in-vre
1153  *thy selfe to what thou art like to be: cast thy humble
1154  *slough, and appeare fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman,
1155  *surly with seruants: Let thy tongue tang arguments of
1156  *state; put thy selfe into the tricke of singularitie. Shee
1157  *thus aduises thee, that sighes for thee. Remember who
1158  *commended thy yellow stockings, and wish'd to see thee
1159  *euer crosse garter'd: I say remember, goe #too, thou art
1160  *made if thou desir'st to be so: If not, let me see thee a ste-ward
1161  *still, the fellow of seruants, and not woorthie to
1162  *touch Fortunes fingers Farewell, Shee that would alter
1163  *seruices with thee, the fortunate vnhappy daylight and
1164  *champian discouers not more: This is open, I will bee
1165  *proud, I will reade politicke Authours, I will baffle Sir
1166  *{Toby}, I will wash off grosse acquaintance, I will be point
1167  *deuise, the very man. I do not now foole my selfe, to let
1168  *imagination iade mee; for euery reason excites to this,
1169  *that my Lady loues me. She did commend my yellow
1170  *stockings of late, shee did praise my legge being crosse- garter'd,
1171  *and in this she manifests her selfe to my loue, &
1172  *with a kinde of iniunction driues mee to these habites of
1173  *her liking. I thanke my starres, I am happy: I will bee
1174  *strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and crosse Garter'd,
1175  *euen with the swiftnesse of putting on. Ioue, and my
1176  *starres be praised. Heere is yet a postscript. {Thou canst}
1177  *{not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainst my loue, let}
1178  *{it appeare in thy smiling, thy smiles become thee well. There-fore}
1179  *{in my presence still smile, deero my sweete, I prethee}. Ioue
1180  *I thanke thee, I will smile, I wil do euery thing that thou
1181   wilt haue me.  <D {Exit}>
1182  *<S {Fab}.> I will not giue my part of this sport for a pensi-on
1183   of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
1184   <S {To}.> I could marry this wench for this deuice.
1185   <S {An}.> So could I too.
1186  *<S {To}.> And aske no other dowry with her, but such ano-ther
1187   iest.
1188   <D {Enter Maria}.>
1189   <S {An}.> Nor I neither.
1190   <S {Fab}.> Heere comes my noble gull catcher.
1191   <S {To}.> Wilt thou set thy foote o'my necke.
1192   <S {An}.> Or o'mine either?
1193  *<S {To}.> Shall I play my freedome at tray- trip, and becom
1194   thy bondslaue?
1195   <S {An}.> Ifaith, or I either?
1196  *<S {Tob}.> Why, thou hast put him in such a dreame, that
1197   when the image of it leaues him, he must run mad.
1198   <S {Ma}.> Nay but say true, do's it worke vpon him?
1199   <S {To}.> Like Aqua vite with a Midwife.
1200  *<S {Mar}.> If you will then see the fruites of the sport, mark
1201  *his first approach before my Lady: hee will come to her
1202  *in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhorres, and
1203  *crosse garter'd, a fashion shee detests: and hee will smile
1204  *vpon her, which will now be so vnsuteable to her dispo-sition,
1205  *being addicted to a melancholly, as shee is, that it
1206  *cannot but turn him into a notable contempt: if you wil
1207   see it follow me.
1208  *<S {To}.> To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent diuell
1209   of wit.
1210   <S {And}.> Ile make one too. <D {Exeunt}>.
1211   <Z {Finis Actus secundus}>
1212   <Z {Actus Tertius, Scaena prima}.>
1213   <D {Enter Viola and Clowne}.>
1214  *<S {Vio}.> Saue thee Friend and thy Musick: dost thou liue
1215   by thy Tabor?
1216   <S {Clo}.> No sir, I liue by the Church.
1217   <S {Vio}.> Art thou a Churchman?
1218  *<S {Clo}.> No such matter sir, I do liue by the Church: For,
1219  *I do liue at my house, and my house dooth stand by the
1220   Church.
1221  *<S {Vio}.> So thou maist say the Kings lyes by a begger, if a
1222  *begger dwell neer him: or the Church stands by thy Ta-bor,
1223   if thy Tabor stand by the Church.
1224  *<S {Clo}.> You haue said sir: To see this age: A sentence is
1225  *but a cheu'rill gloue to a good witte, how quickely the
1226   wrong side may be turn'd outward.
1227  *<S {Vio}.> Nay that's certaine: they that dally nicely with
1228   words, may quickely make them wanton.
1229  *<S {Clo}.> I would therefore my sister had had no name Sir.
1230   <S {Vio}.> Why man?
1231  *<S {Clo}.> Why sir, her names a word, and to dallie with
1232  *that word, might make my sister wanton: But indeede,
1233   words are very Rascals, since bonds disgrac'd them.
1234   <S {Vio}.> Thy reason man?
      <P Z1>
1235  *<S {Clo}.> Troth sir, I can yeeld you none without wordes,
1236  *and wordes are growne so false, I am loath to proue rea-son
1237   with them.
1238  *<S {Vio}.> I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car'st for
1239   nothing.
1240  *<S {Clo}.> Not so sir, I do care for something: but in my con-science
1241  *sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for no-thing
1242   sir, I would it would make you inuisible.
1243   <S {Vio}.> Art not thou the Lady {Oliuia's} foole?
1244  *<S {Clo}.> No indeed sir, the Lady {Oliuia} has no folly, shee
1245  *will keepe no foole sir, till she be married, and fooles are
1246  *as like husbands, as Pilchers are to Herrings, the Hus-bands
1247  *the bigger, I am indeede not her foole, but hir cor-rupter
1248   of words.
1249   <S {Vio}.> I saw thee late at the Count {Orsino's}.
1250  *<S {Clo}.> Foolery sir, does walke about the Orbe like the
1251  *Sun, it shines euery where. I would be sorry sir, but the
1252  *Foole should be as oft with your Master, as with my Mi-stris:
1253   I thinke I saw your wisedome there.
1254  *<S {Vio}.> Nay, #and thou passe vpon me, Ile no more with
1255   thee. Hold there's expences for thee.
1256  *<S {Clo}.> Now Ioue  in his next commodity of hayre, send
1257   thee a beard.
1258  *<S {Vio}.> By my troth Ile tell thee, I am almost sicke for
1259  *one, though I would not haue it grow on my chinne. Is
1260   thy Lady within?
1261   <S {Clo}> Would not a paire of these haue bred sir?
1262   <S {Vio}.> Yes being kept together, and put to vse.
1263  *<S {Clo}.> I would play Lord {Pandarus} of {Phrygia} sir, to bring
1264   a {Cressida} to this {Troylus}.
1265   <S {Vio}.> I vnderstand  you sir, tis well begg'd.
1266  *<S {Clo}.> The matter I hope is not great sir; begging, but a
1267  *begger: {Cressida} was a begger. My Lady is within sir. I
1268  *will conster to them whence you come, who you are, and
1269  *what you would are out of my welkin, I might say Ele-ment,
1270   but the word is ouer- worne.  <D {exit}>
1271   <S {Vio}.> This fellow is wise enough to play the foole,
1272   And to do that well, craues a kinde of wit:
1273   He must obserue their mood on whom he iests,
1274   The quality of persons, and the time:
1275   And like the Haggard, checke at euery Feather
1276   That comes before his eye. This is a practice,
1277   As full of labour as a Wise- mans #Art:
1278   For folly that he wisely shewes, is fit;
1279   But wisemens  folly falne, quite taint their wit.
1280   <D {Enter Sir Toby and Andrew}.>
1281   <S {To}.> Saue you Gentleman.
1282   <S {Vio}.> And you sir.
1283   <S {And}.> {Dieu vou guard Monsieur}.
1284   <S {Vio}.> {Et vouz ousie vostre seruiture}.
1285   <S {An}.> I hope sir, you are, and I am yours.
1286  *<S {To}.> Will you incounter the house, my Neece is desi-rous
1287   you should enter, if your trade be to her.
1288  *<S {Vio}.> I am bound to your Neece sir, I meane she is the
1289   list of my voyage.
1290   <S {To}.> Taste your legges sir, put them to motion.
1291  *<S {Vio}.> My legges do better vnderstand me sir, then I vn-derstand
1292   what you meane by bidding me taste my legs.
1293   <S {To}.> I meane to go sir, to enter.
1294  *<S {Vio}.> I will answer you with gate and entrance, but we
1295   are preuented.
1296   <D {Enter Oliuia, and Gentlewoman}.>
1297  *Most excellent accomplish'd Lady, the heauens raine O-dours
1298   on you.
1299  *<S {And}.> That youth's a rare Courtier, raine odours, wel.
1300  *<S {Vio}.> My matter hath no voice Lady, but to your owne
1301   most pregnant and vouchsafed eare.
1302  *<S {And}.> Odours, pregnant, and vouchsafed: Ile get 'em
1303   all three already.
1304  *<S {Ol}.> Let the Garden doore be shut, and leaue mee to
1305   my hearing. Giue me your hand sir.
1306   <S {Vio}.> My dutie Madam, and most humble seruice.
1307   <S {Ol}.> What  is your name?
1308   <S {Vio}.> {Cesario} is your seruants name, faire Princesse.
1309   <S {Ol}.> My seruant sir? 'Twas neuer merry world,
1310   Since lowly feigning was call'd complement:
1311   Y'are seruant to the Count {Orsino} youth.
1312   <S {Vio}.> And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
1313   Your seruants seruant, is your seruant Madam.
1314  *<S {Ol}.> For him, I thinke not on him: for his thoughts,
1315   Would they were blankes, rather then fill'd with me.
1316  *<S {Vio}.> Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
1317   On his behalfe.
1318   <S {Ol}.> O by your leaue I pray you.
1319   I bad you neuer speake againe of him;
1320   But would you vndertake another suite
1321   I had rather heare you, to solicit that,
1322   Then Musicke from the spheares.
1323   <S {Vio}.> Deere Lady.
1324   <S {Ol}.> Giue me leaue, beseech you: I did send,
1325   After the last enchantment you did heare,
1326   A Ring in chace of you. So did I abuse
1327   My selfe, my seruant, and I feare me you:
1328   Vnder your hard construction must I sit,
1329   To force that on you in a shamefull cunning
1330  *Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?
1331   Haue you not set mine Honor at the stake,
1332   And baited it with all th' vnmuzled thoughts
1333  *That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiuing
1334   Enough is shewne, a Cipresse, not a bosome,
1335   Hides my heart: so let me heare you speake.
1336   <S {Vio}.> I pittie you.
1337   <S {Ol}.> That's a degree to loue.
1338   <S {Vio}.> No not a grize: for tis a vulgar proofe
1339   That verie oft we pitty enemies.
1340   <S {Ol}.> Why then me thinkes 'tis time to smile agen:
1341   O world, how apt the poore are to be proud?
1342   If one should be a prey, how much the better
1343   To fall before the Lion, then the Wolfe?
1344   <D {Clocke strikes}.>
1345   The clocke vpbraides me with the waste of time:
1346   Be not affraid good youth, I will not haue you,
1347   And yet when wit and youth is come to haruest,
1348   Your wife is like to reape a proper man:
1349   There lies your way, due West.
1350   <S {Vio}.> Then Westward hoe:
1351   Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship:
1352   You'l nothing Madam to my Lord, by me:
1353  *<S {Ol}.> Stay: I prethee tell me what thou thinkst of me?
1354   <S {Vio}.> That you do thinke you are not what you are.
1355   <S {Ol}.> If I thinke so, I thinke the same of you.
1356   <S {Vio}.> Then thinke you right: I am not what I am.
1357   <S {Ol}.> I would you were, as I would haue you be.
1358   <S {Vio}.> Would it be better Madam, then I am?
1359   I wish it might, for now I am your foole.
1360   <S {Ol}.> O what a deale of scorne, lookes beautifull?
1361   In the contempt and anger of his lip,
1362   A murdrous guilt shewes not it selfe more soone,
1363  *Then loue that would seeme hid: Loues night, is noone.
1364   {Cesario}, by the Roses of the Spring,
1365   By maid- hood, honor, truth, and euery thing,
1366   I loue thee so, that maugre all thy pride,
      <P Z1v>
1367   Nor wit, nor reason, can my passion hide:
1368   Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
1369   For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause:
1370   But rather reason thus, with reason fetter;
1371   Loue sought, is good: but giuen vnsought, is better.
1372   <S {Vio}.> By innocence I sweare, and by my youth,
1373   I haue one heart, one bosome, and one truth,
1374   And that no woman has, nor neuer none
1375   Shall mistris be of it, saue I alone.
1376   And so adieu good Madam, neuer more,
1377   Will I my Masters teares to you deplore.
1378   <S {Ol}.> Yet come againe: for thou perhaps mayst moue
1379   That heart which now abhorres, to like his loue.  <D {Exeunt}>
1380   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1381   <D {Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian}.>
1382   <S {And}.> No faith, Ile not stay a iot longer:
1383   <S {To}.> Thy reason deere venom, giue thy reason.
1384  *<S {Fab}.> You must needes yeelde your reason, Sir {An-drew}?
1385  _
1386  *<S {And}.> Marry I saw your Neece do more fauours to the
1387  *Counts Seruing- man, then euer she bestow'd vpon mee:
1388   I saw't i'th Orchard.
1389   <S {To}.> Did she see #the while, old boy, tell me that.
1390   <S {And}.> As plaine as I see you now.
1391  *<S {Fab}.> This was a great argument of loue in her toward
1392   you.
1393   <S {And}.> S'light; will you make an Asse o'me.
1394  *<S {Fab}.> I will proue it legitimate sir, vpon the Oathes of
1395   iudgement, and reason.
1396  *<S {To}.> And they haue beene grand Iurie men, since before
1397   {Noah} was a Saylor.
1398  *<S {Fab}.> Shee did shew fauour to the youth in your sight,
1399  *onely to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour,
1400  *to put fire in your Heart, and brimstone in your Liuer:
1401  *you should then haue accosted her, and with some excel-lent
1402  *iests, fire- new from the mint, you should haue bangd
1403  *the youth into dumbenesse: this was look'd for at your
1404  *hand, and this was baulkt: the double gilt of this oppor-tunitie
1405  *you let time wash off, and you are now sayld into
1406  *the North of my Ladies opinion, where you will hang
1407  *like an ysickle on a Dutchmans beard, vnlesse you do re-deeme
1408  *it, by some laudable attempt, either of valour or
1409   policie.
1410  *<S {And}.> And't be any way, it must be with Valour, for
1411  *policie I hate: I had as liefe be a Brownist, as a Politi-cian.
1412  _
1413  *<S {To}.> Why then build me thy fortunes vpon the basis of
1414  *valour. Challenge me the Counts youth to fight with him
1415  *hurt him in eleuen places, my Neece shall take note of it,
1416  *and assure thy selfe, there is no loue- Broker in the world,
1417  *can more preuaile in mans commendation with woman,
1418   then report of valour.
1419   <S {Fab}.> There is no way but this sir {Andrew}.
1420  *<S {An}.> Will either of you beare me a challenge to him?
1421  *<S {To}.> Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and briefe:
1422  *it is no matter how wittie, so it bee eloquent, and full of
1423  *inuention: taunt him with the license of Inke: if thou
1424  *thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amisse, and as ma-ny
1425  *Lyes,  as will lye in thy sheete of paper, although the
1426  *sheete were bigge enough for the bedde of {Ware} in Eng-land,
1427  *set 'em downe, go about it. Let there bee gaulle e-nough
1428  *in thy inke, though thou write with a Goose- pen,
1429   no matter: about it.
1430   <S {And}.> Where shall I finde you?
1431   <S {To}.> Wee'l call thee at the Cubiculo: Go.
1432   <D {Exit Sir Andrew}.>
1433   <S {Fa}.> This is a deere Manakin to you Sir {Toby}.
1434  *<S {To}.> I haue beene deere to him lad, some two thousand
1435   strong, or so.
1436  *<S {Fa}.> We shall haue a rare Letter from him; but you'le
1437   not deliuer't.
1438  *<S {To}.> Neuer trust me then: and by all meanes stirre on
1439  *the youth to an answer. I thinke Oxen and waine- ropes
1440  *cannot hale them together. For {Andrew}, if he were open'd
1441  *and you finde so much blood in his Liuer, as will clog the
1442   foote of a flea, Ile eate the rest of th' anatomy.
1443  *<S {Fab}.> And his opposit the youth beares in his visage no
1444   great presage of cruelty.
1445   <D {Enter Maria}.>
1446  *<S {To}.> Looke where the youngest Wren of mine comes.
1447  *<S {Mar}.> If you desire the spleene, and will laughe your
1448  *selues into stitches, follow me; yond gull {Maluolio} is tur-ned
1449  *Heathen, a verie Renegatho; for there is no christian
1450  *that meanes to be saued by beleeuing rightly, can euer
1451  *beleeue such impossible passages of grossenesse. Hee's in
1452   yellow stockings.
1453   <S {To}.> And crosse garter'd?
1454  *<S {Mar}.> Most villanously: like a Pedant that keepes a
1455  *Schoole i'th Church: I haue dogg'd him like his murthe-rer.
1456  *He does obey euery point of the Letter that I dropt,
1457  *to betray him: He does smile his face into more lynes,
1458  *then is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the
1459  *Indies: you haue not seene such a thing as tis: I can hard-ly
1460  *forbeare hurling things at him, I know my Ladie will
1461  *strike him: if shee doe, hee'l smile, and take't for a great
1462   fauour.
1463   <S {To}.> Come bring vs, bring vs where he is.
1464   <D {Exeunt Omnes}.>
1465   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1466   <D {Enter Sebastian and Anthonio}.>
1467   <S {Seb}.> I would not by my #will haue troubled you,
1468   But since you make your pleasure of your paines,
1469   I will no further chide you.
1470   <S {Ant}.> I could not stay behinde you: my desire
1471   (More sharpe then filed steele) did spurre me forth,
1472   And not all loue to see you (though so much
1473   As might haue drawne one to a longer voyage)
1474   But iealousie, what might befall your trauell,
1475   Being skillesse in these parts: which to a stranger,
1476   Vnguided, and vnfriended, often proue
1477   Rough, and vnhospitable. My willing loue,
1478   The rather by these arguments of feare
1479   Set forth in your pursuite.
1480   <S {Seb}.> My kinde {Anthonio},
1481   I can no other answer make, but thankes,
1482   And thankes: and euer oft good turnes,
1483   Are shuffel'd off with such vncurrant pay:
1484   But were my worth, as is my conscience firme,
      <P Z2>
1485   You should finde better dealing: what's to do?
1486   Shall we go see the reliques of this Towne?
1487  *<S {Ant}.> To morrow sir, best first go see your Lodging?
1488   <S {Seb}.> I am not  weary, and 'tis long to night
1489   I pray you let vs satisfie our eyes
1490   With the memorials, and the things of fame
1491   That do renowne this City.
1492   <S {Ant}.> Would youl'd pardon me:
1493   I do not without danger walke these streetes.
1494   Once in a sea- fight 'gainst the Count his gallies,
1495   I did some seruice, of such note indeede,
1496   That were I tane heere, it would scarse be answer'd.
1497   <S {Seb}.> Belike you slew great number of his people.
1498   <S {Ant}.> Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature,
1499   Albeit the quality of the time, and quarrell
1500   Might well haue giuen vs bloody argument:
1501   It might haue since bene answer'd in repaying
1502   What we tooke from them, which for Traffiques sake
1503   Most of our City did. Onely my selfe stood out,
1504   For which if I be lapsed in this place
1505   I shall pay deere.
1506   <S {Seb}.> Do not then walke too open.
1507   <S {Ant}.> It doth not fit me: hold sir, here's my purse,
1508   In the South Suburbes at the Elephant
1509   Is best to lodge: I will bespeake our dyet,
1510  *Whiles you beguile the time, and feed your knowledge
1511   With viewing of the Towne, there shall you haue me.
1512   <S {Seb}.> Why I your purse?
1513   <S {Ant}.> Haply your eye shall light vpon some toy
1514   You haue desire to purchase: and your store
1515   I thinke is not for idle Markets, sir.
1516   <S {Seb}.> Ile be your purse- bearer, and leaue you
1517   For an houre.
1518   <S {Ant}.> To th' Elephant.
1519   <S {Seb}.> I do remember.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1520   <Z {Scoena Quarta}.>
1521   <D {Enter Oliuia and Maria}.>
1522   <S {Ol}.> I haue sent after him, he sayes hee'l come:
1523   How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?
1524  *For youth is bought more oft, then begg'd, or borrow'd.
1525  *I speake too loud: Where's {Maluolio}, he is sad, and ciuill,
1526   And suites well for a seruant with my fortunes,
1527   Where is {Maluolio}?
1528   <S {Mar}.> He's comming Madame:
1529   But in very strange manner. He is sure possest Madam.
1530   <S {Ol}.> Why what's the matter, does he raue?
1531  *<S {Mar}.> No Madam, he does nothing but smile: your La-dyship
1532  *were best to haue some guard about you, if hee
1533   come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits.
1534   <S {Ol}.> Go call him hither.
1535   <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
1536   I am as madde as hee,
1537   If sad and merry madnesse  equall bee.
1538   How now {Maluolio}?
1539   <S {Mal}.> Sweet Lady, ho, ho.
1540   <S {Ol}.> Smil'st thou? I sent for thee vpon a sad occasion.
1541   <S {Mal}.> Sad Lady, I could be sad:
1542   This does make some obstruction in the blood:
1543   This crosse- gartering, but what of that?
1544   If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true
1545   Sonnet is: Please one, and please all.
1546   <S {Mal}.> Why how doest thou man?
1547   What is the matter with thee?
1548  *<S {Mal}.> Not blacke in my minde, though yellow in my
1549  *legges: It did come to his hands, and Commaunds shall
1550  *be executed. I thinke we doe know the sweet Romane
1551   hand.
1552   <S {Ol}.> Wilt thou go to bed {Maluolio}?
1553   <S {Mal}.> To bed? #I sweet heart, and Ile come to thee.
1554  *<S {Ol}.> God comfort thee: Why dost thou smile so, and
1555   kisse thy hand so oft?
1556   <S {Mar}.> How do you {Maluolio}?
1557   <S {Maluo}.> At your request:
1558   Yes Nightingales answere Dawes.
1559  *<S {Mar}.> Why appeare you with this ridiculous bold-nesse
1560   before my Lady.
1561   <S {Mal}.> Be not afraid of greatnesse: 'twas well writ.
1562   <S {Ol}.> What meanst thou by that {Maluolio}?
1563   <S {Mal}.> Some are borne great.
1564   <S {Ol}.> Ha?
1565   <S {Mal}.> Some atcheeue greatnesse.
1566   <S {Ol}.> What sayst thou?
1567   <S {Mal}.> And some haue greatnesse thrust vpon them.
1568   <S {Ol}.> Heauen restore thee.
1569  *<S {Mal}.> Remember who commended thy yellow stock-ings.
1570  _
1571   <S {Ol}.> Thy yellow stockings?
1572   <S {Mal}.> And wish'd to see thee crosse garter'd.
1573   <S {Ol}.> Crosse garter'd?
1574  *<S {Mal}.> Go #too, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so.
1575   <S {Ol}.> Am I made?
1576   <S {Mal}.> If not, let me see thee a seruant still.
1577   <S {Ol}.> Why this is verie Midsommer madnesse.
1578   <D {Enter Seruant}.>
1579  *<S {Ser}.> Madame, the young Gentleman of the Count
1580  *{Orsino's} is return'd, I could hardly entreate him backe: he
1581   attends your Ladyships pleasure.
1582   <S {Ol}.> Ile come to him.
1583  *Good {Maria}, let this fellow be look'd  #too. Where's my
1584  *Cosine {Toby}, let some of my people haue a speciall care
1585  *of him, I would not haue him miscarrie for the halfe of
1586   my Dowry.  <D {exit}>
1587  *<S {Mal}.> Oh ho, do you come neere me now: no worse
1588  *man then sir {Toby} to looke to me. This concurres direct-ly
1589  *with the Letter, she sends him on purpose, that I may
1590  *appeare stubborne to him: for she incites me to that in
1591  *the Letter. Cast thy humble slough sayes she: be oppo-site
1592  *with a Kinsman, surly with seruants, let thy tongue
1593  *langer with arguments of state, put thy selfe into the
1594  *tricke of singularity: and consequently setts downe the
1595  *manner how: as a sad face, a reuerend carriage, a slow
1596  *tongue, in the habite of some #Sir of note, and so foorth.
1597  *I haue lymde her, but it is Ioues doing, and Ioue make me
1598  *thankefull. And when she went away now, let this Fel-low
1599  *be look'd #too: Fellow? not {Maluolio}, nor after my
1600  *degree, but Fellow. Why euery thing adheres togither,
1601  *that no dramme of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no
1602  *obstacle, no incredulous or vnsafe circumstance: What
1603  *can be saide? Nothing that can be, can come betweene
1604  *me, and the full prospect of my hopes. Well Ioue, not I,
1605   is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
1606   <D {Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria}.>
      <P Z2v>
1607  *<S {To}.> Which way is hee in the name of sanctity. If all
1608  *the diuels of #hell be drawne in little, and Legion himselfe
1609   possest him, yet Ile speake to him.
1610   <S {Fab}.> Heere he is, heere he is: how ist with you sir?
1611   How ist with you man?
1612  *<S {Mal}.> Go off, I discard you: let me enioy my priuate:
1613   go off.
1614  *<S {Mar}.> Lo, how hollow the fiend speakes within him;
1615  *did not I tell you? Sir {Toby}, my Lady prayes you to haue
1616   a care of him.
1617   <S {Mal}.> Ah ha, does she so?
1618  *<S {To}.> Go #too, go #too: peace, peace, wee must deale
1619  *gently with him: Let me alone. How do you {Maluolio}?
1620  *How ist with you? What man, defie the diuell: consider,
1621   he's an enemy to mankinde.
1622   <S {Mal}.> Do you know what you say?
1623  *<S {Mar}.> La you, #and you speake #ill of the diuell, how
1624   he takes it at heart. Pray God he be not bewitch'd.
1625   <S {Fab}.> Carry his water to th' wise woman.
1626  *<S {Mar}.> Marry and it shall be done to morrow morning
1627  *if I liue. My Lady would not loose him for more then ile
1628   say.
1629   <S {Mal}.> How now mistris?
1630   <S {Mar}.> Oh Lord.
1631  *<S {To}.> Prethee hold thy peace, this is not the way: Doe
1632   you not see you moue him? Let me alone with him.
1633  *<S {Fa}.> No way but gentlenesse, gently, gently: the Fiend
1634   is rough, and will not be roughly vs'd.
1635  *<S {To}.> Why how now my bawcock? how dost y chuck?
1636   <S {Mal}.> Sir.
1637  *<S {To}.> #I biddy, come with me. What man, tis not for
1638  *grauity to play at cherrie- pit with sathan Hang him foul
1639   Colliar.
1640  *<S {Mar}.> Get him to say his prayers, good sir {Toby} gette
1641   him to pray.
1642   <S {Mal}.> My prayers Minx.
1643  *<S {Mar}.> No I warrant you, he will not heare of godly-nesse.
1644  _
1645  *<S {Mal}.> Go hang your selues all: you are ydle shallowe
1646  *things, I am not of your element, you shall knowe more
1647   heereafter.  <D {Exit}>
1648   <S {To}.> Ist possible?
1649  *<S {Fa}.> If this were plaid vpon a stage  now, I could con-demne
1650   it as an improbable fiction.
1651  *<S {To}.> His very genius hath taken the infection of the
1652   deuice man.
1653  *<S {Mar}.> Nay pursue him now, least the deuice take ayre,
1654   and taint.
1655   <S {Fa}.> Why we shall make him mad indeede.
1656   <S {Mar}.> The house will be the quieter.
1657  *<S {To}.> Come, wee'l haue him in a darke room & bound.
1658  *My Neece is already in the beleefe that he's mad: we may
1659  *carry it thus for our pleasure, and his pennance, til our ve-ry
1660  *pastime tyred out of breath, prompt vs to haue mercy
1661  *on him: at which time, we wil bring the deuice to the bar
1662  *and crowne thee for a finder of madmen: but see, but see.
1663   <D {Enter Sir Andrew}.>
1664   <S {Fa}.> More matter for a #May morning.
1665  *<S {An}.> Heere's the Challenge, reade it: I warrant there's
1666   vinegar and pepper in't.
1667   <S {Fab}.> Ist so sawcy?
1668   <S {And}.> #I, ist? I warrant him: do but read.
1669   <S {To}.> Giue me.
1670   {Youth, whatsoeuer  thou art, thou art but a scuruy fellow}.
1671   <S {Fa}.> Good, and valiant.
1672  *<S {To}.> {Wonder not, nor admire not in thy minde why I doe call}
1673   {thee so, for I will shew thee no reason for't}.
1674  *<S {Fa}.> A good note, that keepes you from the blow of y |(Law
1675  *<S {To}.> {Thou comst to the Lady Oliuia, and in my sight she vses}
1676  *{thee kindly: but thou lyest in thy throat, that is not the matter}
1677   {I challenge thee for}.
1678   <S {Fa}.> Very breefe, and to exceeding good sence- lesse.
1679  *<S {To}.> {I will way- lay thee going home, where if it be thy chance}
1680   {to kill me}.
1681   <S {Fa}.> Good.
1682   <S {To}.> {Thou kilst me like a rogue and a villaine}.
1683  *<S {Fa}.> Still you keepe o'th windie side of the Law: good.
1684  *<S {Tob}.> {Fartheewell, and God haue mercie vpon one of our}
1685  *{soules. He may haue mercie vpon mine, but my hope is better},
1686  *{and so looke to thy selfe. Thy friend as thou vsest him, & thy}
1687   {sworne enemie}, Andrew Ague- cheeke.
1688   <S {To}.> If this Letter moue him not, his legges cannot:
1689   Ile giu't him.
1690  *<S {Mar}.> You may haue verie fit occasion for't: he is now
1691  *in some commerce with my Ladie, and will #by and by
1692   depart.
1693  *<S {To}.> Go sir {Andrew}: scout mee for him at the corner
1694  *of the Orchard like a bum- Baylie: so soone as euer thou
1695  *seest him, draw, and as thou draw'st, sweare horrible: for
1696  *it comes to passe oft, that a terrible oath, with a swagge-ring
1697  *accent sharpely twang'd off, giues manhoode more
1698  *approbation, then euer proofe it selfe would haue earn'd
1699   him. Away.
1700   <S {And}.> Nay let me alone for swearing.  <D {Exit}>
1701  *<S {To}.> Now will not I deliuer his Letter: for the behaui-our
1702  *of the yong Gentleman, giues him out to be of good
1703  *capacity, and breeding: his employment betweene his
1704  *Lord and my Neece, confirmes no lesse. Therefore, this
1705  *Letter being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror
1706  *in the youth: he will finde it comes from a Clodde- pole.
1707  *But sir, I will deliuer his Challenge by word of mouth;
1708  *set vpon {Ague- cheeke} a notable report of valor, and driue
1709  *the Gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receiue it)
1710  *into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, furie, and
1711  *impetuositie. This will so fright them both, that they wil
1712   kill one another by the looke, like Cockatrices.
1713   <D {Enter Oliuia and Viola}.>
1714  *<S {Fab}.> Heere he comes with your Neece, giue them way
1715   till he take leaue, and presently after him.
1716  *<S {To}.> I wil meditate the while vpon some horrid message
1717   for a Challenge.
1718   <S {Ol}.> I haue said too much vnto a hart of stone,
1719   And laid mine honour too vnchary on't:
1720   There's something in me that reproues my fault:
1721   But such a head- strong potent fault it is,
1722   That it but mockes reproofe.
1723  *<S {Vio}.> With the same hauiour that your passion beares,
1724   Goes on my Masters greefes.
1725  *<S {Ol}.> Heere, weare this Iewell for me, tis my picture:
1726   Refuse it not, it hath no tongue, to vex you:
1727   And I beseech you come againe to morrow.
1728   What shall you aske of me that Ile deny,
1729   That honour (sau'd) may vpon asking giue.
1730  *<S {Vio}.> Nothing but this, your true loue for my master.
1731   <S {Ol}.> How with mine honor may I giue him that,
1732   Which I haue giuen to you.
1733   <S {Vio}.> I will acquit you.
1734   <S {Ol}.> Well, come againe to morrow: far- thee- well,
1735   A Fiend like thee might beare my soule to #hell.
1736   <D {Enter Toby and Fabian}.>
1737   <S {To}.> Gentleman, God saue thee.
      <P Z3>
1738   <S {Vio}.> And you sir.
1739  *<S {To}.> That defence thou hast, betake #the too't: of what
1740  *nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knowe not:
1741  *but thy intercepter full of despight, bloody as the Hun-ter,
1742  *attends thee at the Orchard end: dismount thy tucke,
1743  *be #yare  in thy preparation, for thy assaylant is quick, skil-full,
1744   and deadly.
1745  *<S {Vio}.> You mistake sir I am sure, no man hath any quar-rell
1746  *to me: my remembrance is very free and cleere from
1747   any image of offence done to any man.
1748  *<S {To}.> You'l finde it otherwise  I assure you: therefore, if
1749  *you hold your life at any price, betake you to your gard:
1750  *for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill,
1751   and wrath, can furnish man withall.
1752   <S {Vio}.> I pray you sir what is he?
1753  *<S {To}.> He is knight dubb'd with vnhatch'd Rapier, and
1754  *on carpet consideration, but he is a diuell in priuate brall,
1755  *soules and bodies hath he diuorc'd three, and his incense-ment
1756  *at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction
1757  *can be none, but by pangs of death and sepulcher: Hob,
1758   nob, is his word: giu't or take't.
1759  *<S {Vio}.> I will returne againe into  the house, and desire
1760  *some conduct of the Lady. I am no fighter, I haue heard
1761  *of some kinde of men, that put quarrells purposely on o-thers,
1762  *to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that
1763   quirke.
1764  *<S {To}.> Sir, no: his indignation deriues it selfe out of a ve-ry
1765  *computent iniurie, therefore get you on, and giue him
1766  *his desire. Backe you shall not to the house, vnlesse you
1767  *vndertake that with me, which with as much safetie you
1768  *might answer him: therefore on, or strippe your sword
1769  *starke naked: for meddle you must that's certain, or for-sweare
1770   to weare iron about you.
1771  *<S {Vio}.> This is as vnciuill as strange. I beseech you doe
1772  *me this courteous office, as to know of the Knight what
1773  *my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence,
1774   nothing of my purpose.
1775  *<S {To}.> I will doe so. Signiour {Fabian}, stay you by this
1776   Gentleman, till my returne.  <D {Exit Toby}.>
1777   <S {Vio}.> Pray you sir, do you know of this matter?
1778  *<S {Fab}.> I know the knight is incenst against you, euen to
1779  *a mortall arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance
1780   more.
1781   <S {Vio}.> I beseech you what manner of man is he?
1782  *<S {Fab}.> Nothing of that wonderfull promise to read him
1783  *by his forme, as you are like to finde him in the proofe of
1784  *his valour. He is indeede sir, the most skilfull, bloudy, &
1785  *fatall opposite that you could possibly haue found in anie
1786  *part of Illyria: will you walke towards him, I will make
1787   your peace with him, if I can.
1788  *<S {Vio}.> I shall bee much bound to you for't: I am one,
1789  *that had rather go with sir Priest, then sir knight: I care
1790   not who knowes so much of my mettle.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1791   <D {Enter Toby and Andrew}.>
1792  *<S {To}.> Why man hee s a verie diuell, I haue not seen such
1793  *a firago: I had a passe with him, rapier, scabberd, and all:
1794  *and he giues me the stucke in with such a mortall motion
1795  *that it is ineuitable: and on the answer, he payes you as
1796  *surely, as your feete hits the ground they step on. They
1797   say, he has bin Fencer to the Sophy.
1798   <S {And}.> Pox on't, Ile not meddle with him.
1799   <S {To}.> #I but he will not now be pacified,
1800   {Fabian} can scarse hold him yonder.
1801  *<S {An}.> Plague on't,  #and I thought he had beene valiant,
1802  *and so cunning in Fence, I'de haue seene him damn'd ere
1803  *I'de haue challeng'd him. Let him let the matter slip, and
1804   Ile giue him my horse, gray Capilet.
1805  *<S {To}.> Ile make the motion: stand heere, make a good
1806  *shew on't, this shall end without the perdition of soules,
1807   marry Ile ride your horse as well as I ride you.
1808   <D {Enter Fabian and Viola}.>
1809  *I haue his horse to take vp the quarrell, I haue perswaded
1810   him the youths a diuell.
1811  *<S {Fa}.> He is as horribly conceited of him: and pants, &
1812   lookes pale, as if a Beare were at his heeles.
1813  *<S {To}.> There's no remedie sir, he will fight with you for's
1814  *oath sake: marrie hee hath better bethought him of his
1815  *quarrell, and hee findes that now scarse to bee worth tal-king
1816  *of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vowe,
1817   he protests he will not hurt you.
1818  *<S {Vio}.> Pray God defend me: a little thing would make
1819   me tell them how much I lacke of a man.
1820   <S {Fab}.> Giue ground if you see him furious.
1821  *<S {To}.> Come sir {Andrew}, there's no remedie, the Gen-tleman
1822  *will for his honors sake haue one bowt with you:
1823  *he cannot by the Duello auoide it: but hee has promised
1824  *me, as he is a Gentleman and a Soldiour, he will not hurt
1825   you. Come on, too't.
1826   <S {And}.> Pray God he keepe his oath.
1827   <D {Enter Antonio}.>
1828   <S {Vio}.> I do assure you tis against my #will.
1829   <S {Ant}.> Put vp your sword: if this yong Gentleman
1830   Haue done offence, I take the fault on me:
1831   If you offend him, I for him defie you.
1832   <S {To}.> You sir? Why, what are you?
1833   <S {Ant}.> One sir, that for his loue dares yet do more
1834   Then you haue heard him brag to you he will.
1835   <S {To}.> Nay, if you be an vndertaker, I am for you.
1836   <D {Enter Officers}.>
1837   <S {Fab}.> O good sir {Toby} hold: heere come the Officers.
1838   <S {To}.> Ile be with you anon.
1839   <S {Vio}.> Pray sir, put your sword vp if you please.
1840  *<S {And}.> Marry will I sir: and for that I promis'd you Ile
1841  *be as good as my word. Hee will beare you easily, and
1842   raines well.
1843   <S 1.{Off}.> This is the man, do thy Office.
1844  *<S 2.{Off}.> {Anthonio}, I arrest thee at the suit of Count {Orsino}
1845   <S {An}.> You do mistake me sir.
1846   <S 1.{Off}.> No sir, no iot: I know your fauour well:
1847   Though now you haue no sea- cap on your head:
1848   Take him away, he knowes I know him well.
1849   <S {Ant}.> I must obey. This comes with seeking you:
1850   But there's no remedie, I shall answer it:
1851   What will you do: now my necessitie
1852   Makes me to aske you for my purse. It greeues mee
1853   Much more, for what I cannot do for you,
1854   Then what befals my selfe: you stand amaz'd,
1855   But be of comfort.
1856   <S 2.{Off}.> Come sir away.
1857   <S {Ant}.> I must entreat of you some of that money.
1858   <S {Vio}.> What money sir?
1859   For the fayre kindnesse you haue shew'd me heere,
1860   And part being prompted by your present trouble,
1861   Out of my leane and low ability
1862   Ile lend you something: my #hauing is not much,
1863   Ile make diuision of my present with you:
1864   Hold, there's halfe my Coffer.
1865   <S {Ant}.> Will you deny me now,
1866   Ist possible that my deserts to you
1867   Can lacke perswasion. Do not tempt my misery,
1868   Least that it make me so vnsound a man
1869   As to vpbraid you with those kindnesses
      <P Z3v>
1870   That I haue done for you.
1871   <S {Vio}.> I know of none,
1872   Nor know I you by voyce, or any feature:
1873   I hate ingratitude more in a man,
1874   Then lying, vainnesse, babling drunkennesse,
1875   Or any taint of vice, whose strong corruption
1876   Inhabites our fraile blood.
1877   <S {Ant}.> Oh heauens themselues.
1878   <S 2.{Off}.> Come sir, I pray you go.
1879  *<S {Ant}.> Let me speake a little. This youth that you see |(heere,
1880   I snatch'd one halfe out of the iawes of death,
1881   Releeu'd him with such sanctitie of loue;
1882   And to his image, which me thought did promise
1883   Most venerable worth, did I deuotion.
1884   <S 1.{Off}.> What's that to vs, the time goes by: Away.
1885   <S {Ant}.> But oh, how vilde an idoll proues this God:
1886   Thou hast {Sebastian} done good feature, shame.
1887   In Nature, there's no blemish but the minde:
1888   None can be call'd deform'd, but the vnkinde.
1889   Vertue is beauty, but the beauteous euill
1890   Are empty trunkes, ore- flourish'd by the deuill.
1891   <S 1.{Off}.> The man growes mad, away with him:
1892   Come, come sir.
1893   <S {Ant}.> Leade me on.  <D {Exit}>
1894  *<S {Vio}.> Me thinkes his words do from such passion flye
1895   That he beleeues himselfe, so do not I:
1896   Proue true imagination, oh proue true,
1897   That I deere brother, be now tane for you.
1898  *<S {To}.> Come hither Knight, come hither {Fabian}: Weel
1899   whisper ore a couplet or two of most sage sawes.
1900   <S {Vio}.> He nam'd {Sebastian}: I my brother know
1901   Yet liuing in my glasse: euen such, and so
1902   In fauour was my Brother, and he went
1903   Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
1904   For him I imitate: Oh if it proue,
1905   Tempests are kinde, and salt waues fresh in loue.
1906  *<S {To}.> A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward
1907  *then a Hare, his dishonesty appeares, in leauing his frend
1908  *heere in necessity, and denying him: and for his coward-ship
1909   aske {Fabian}.
1910  *<S {Fab}.> A Coward, a most deuout Coward, religious in
1911   it.
1912   <S {And}.> Slid Ile after him againe, and beate him.
1913  *<S {To}.> Do, cuffe him soundly, but neuer draw thy sword
1914   <S {And}.> #And I do not.
1915   <S {Fab}.> Come, let's see the euent.
1916  *<S {To}.> I dare lay any money, twill be nothing yet.  <D {Exit}>
1917   <Z {Actus Quartus, Scaena prima}.>
1918   <D {Enter Sebastian and Clowne}.>
1919  *<S {Clo}.> Will you make me beleeue, that I am not sent for
1920   you?
1921   <S {Seb}.> Go #too, go #too, thou art a foolish fellow,
1922   Let me be cleere of thee.
1923  *<S {Clo}.> Well held out yfaith: No, I do not know you,
1924  *nor I am not sent to you by my Lady, to bid you come
1925  *speake with her: nor your name is not Master {Cesario},
1926  *nor this is not my nose neyther: Nothing that is so, is so.
1927  *<S {Seb}.> I prethee vent thy folly some- where else, thou
1928   know'st not me.
1929  *<S {Clo}.> Vent my folly: He has heard that word of some
1930  *great man, and now applyes it to a foole. Vent my fol-ly:
1931  *I am affraid this great lubber the World will proue a
1932  *Cockney: I prethee now vngird thy strangenes, and tell
1933  *me what I shall vent to my Lady? Shall I vent to hir that
1934   thou art comming?
1935  *<S {Seb}.> I prethee foolish greeke depart from me, there's
1936  *money for thee, if you tarry longer, I shall giue worse
1937   paiment.
1938  *<S {Clo}.> By my troth thou hast an open hand: these Wise-men
1939  *that giue fooles money, get themselues a good re-port,
1940   after foureteene yeares purchase.
1941   <D {Enter Andrew, Toby, and Fabian}.>
1942  *<S {And}.> Now sir, haue I met you again: ther's for you.
1943   <S {Seb}.> Why there's for thee, and there, and there,
1944   Are all the people mad?
1945  *<S {To}.> Hold sir, or Ile throw your dagger ore the house
1946  *<S {Clo}.> This will I tell my Lady straight, I would not be
1947   in some of your coats for two pence.
1948   <S {To}.> Come on sir, hold.
1949  *<S {An}.> Nay let him alone, Ile go another way to worke
1950  *with him: Ile haue an action of Battery against him, if
1951  *there be any law in Illyria: though I stroke him first, yet
1952   it's no matter for that.
1953   <S {Seb}.> Let go thy hand.
1954  *<S {To}.> Come sir, I will not let you go. Come my yong
1955  *souldier put vp your yron: you are well flesh'd: Come
1956   on.
1957  *<S {Seb}.> I will be free from thee. What wouldst y now?
1958   If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword.
1959  *<S {To}.> What, what? Nay then I must haue an Ounce or
1960   two of this malapert blood from you.
1961   <D {Enter Oliuia}.>
1962   <S {Ol}.> Hold {Toby}, on thy life I charge thee hold.
1963   <S {To}.> Madam.
1964   <S {Ol}.> Will it be euer thus? Vngracious wretch,
1965   Fit for the Mountaines, and the barbarous Caues,
1966   Where manners nere were preach'd: out of my sight.
1967   Be not offended, deere {Cesario}:
1968   Rudesbey be gone. I prethee gentle friend,
1969   Let thy fayre wisedome, not thy passion sway
1970   In this vnciuill, and vniust extent
1971   Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
1972   And heare thou there how many fruitlesse prankes
1973   This Ruffian hath botch'd vp, that thou thereby
1974   Mayst smile at this: Thou shalt not choose but goe:
1975   Do not denie, beshrew his soule for mee,
1976   He started one poore heart of mine, in thee.
1977   <S {Seb}.> What rellish is in this? How runs the streame?
1978   Or I am mad, or else this is a dreame:
1979   Let fancie still my sense in Lethe steepe,
1980   If it be thus to dreame, still let me sleepe.
1981  *<S {Ol}.> Nay come I prethee, would thoud'st be rul'd by me
1982   <S {Seb}.> Madam, I will.
1983   <S {Ol}.> O say so, and so be.  <D {Exeunt}>
1984   <Z {Scoena Secunda}.>
1985   <D {Enter Maria and Clowne}.>
1986  *<S {Mar}.> Nay, I prethee put on this gown, & this beard,
1987  *make him beleeue thou art sir {Topas} the Curate, doe it
1988   quickly. Ile call sir {Toby} the whilst.
1989  *<S {Clo}.> Well, Ile put it on, and I will dissemble my selfe
1990  *in't, and I would I were the first that euer dissembled in
      <P Z4>
1991  *in such a gowne. I am not tall enough to become the
1992  *function well, nor leane enough to bee thought a good
1993  *Studient: but to be said an honest man and a good hous-keeper
1994  *goes as fairely, as to say, a carefull man, & a great
1995   scholler. The Competitors enter.
1996   <D {Enter Toby}.>
1997   <S {To}.> Ioue blesse thee M[aster]. Parson.
1998  *<S {Clo}.> {Bonos dies} sir {Toby}: for as the old hermit of {Prage}
1999  *that neuer saw pen and inke, very wittily sayd to a Neece
2000  *of King {Gorbodacke}, that that is, #is: so I being M[aster]. Parson,
2001  *am M[aster]. Parson; for what is that, but #that? and is, but #is?
2002   <S {To}.> To him sir {Topas}.
2003   <S {Clow}.> What hoa, I say, Peace in this prison.
2004   <S {To}.> The knaue counterfets well: a good knaue.
2005   <D {Maluolio within}.>
2006   <S {Mal}.> Who cals there?
2007  *<S {Clo}.> Sir {Topas} the Curate, who comes to visit {Maluo-lio}
2008   the Lunaticke.
2009  *<S {Mal}.> Sir {Topas}, sir {Topas}, good sir {Topas} goe to my
2010   Ladie.
2011  *<S {Clo}.> Out hyperbolicall fiend, how vexest thou this
2012   man? Talkest thou nothing but of Ladies?
2013   <S {Tob}.> Well said M[aster]. Parson.
2014  *<S {Mal}.> Sir {Topas}, neuer was man thus wronged, good
2015  *sir {Topas} do not thinke I am mad: they haue layde mee
2016   heere in hideous darknesse.
2017  *<S {Clo}.> Fye, thou dishonest sathan: I call thee by the
2018  *most modest termes, for I am one of those gentle ones,
2019  *that will vse the diuell himselfe  with curtesie: sayst thou
2020   that house is darke?
2021   <S {Mal}.> As #hell sir {Topas}.
2022  *<S {Clo}.> Why it hath bay Windowes transparant as bari-cadoes,
2023  *and the cleere stores toward the South north, are
2024  *as lustrous as Ebony: and yet complainest thou of ob-struction?
2025  _
2026  *<S {Mal}.> I am not mad sir {Topas}, I say to you this house is
2027   darke.
2028  *<S {Clo}.> Madman thou errest: I say there is no darknesse
2029  *but ignorance, in which thou art more puzel'd then the
2030   Aegyptians in their fogge.
2031  *<S {Mal}.> I say this house is as darke as Ignorance, thogh
2032  *Ignorance were as darke as #hell; and I say there was ne-uer
2033  *man thus abus'd, I am no more madde then you are,
2034   make the triall of it in any constant question.
2035   <S {Clo}.> What is the opinion of {Pythagoras} concerning
2036   Wilde- fowle?
2037  *<S {Mal}.> That the soule of our grandam, might happily
2038   inhabite a bird.
2039   <S {Clo}.> What thinkst thou of his opinion?
2040  *<S {Mal}.> I thinke nobly of the soule, and no way aproue
2041   his opinion.
2042  *<S {Clo}.> Fare thee well: remaine thou still in darkenesse,
2043  *thou shalt hold th' opinion of {Pythagoras}, ere I will allow
2044  *of thy wits, and feare to kill a Woodcocke, lest thou dis-possesse
2045   the soule of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
2046   <S {Mal}.> Sir {Topas}, sir {Topas}.
2047   <S {Tob}.> My most exquisite sir {Topas}.
2048   <S {Clo}.> Nay I am for all waters.
2049  *<S {Mar}.> Thou mightst haue done this without thy berd
2050   and gowne, he sees thee not.
2051  *<S {To}.> To him in thine owne voyce, and bring me word
2052  *how thou findst him: I would we were well ridde of this
2053  *knauery. If he may bee conueniently deliuer'd, I would
2054  *he were, for I am now so farre in offence with my Niece,
2055  *that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport the vppe-shot.
2056   Come #by and by to my Chamber.  <D {Exit}>
2057  *<S {Clo}.> Hey Robin, iolly Robin, tell me how thy Lady
2058   does.
2059   <S {Mal}.> Foole.
2060   <S {Clo}.> My Lady is vnkind, {perdie}.
2061   <S {Mal}.> Foole.
2062   <S {Clo}.> Alas why is she so?
2063   <S {Mal}.> Foole, I say.
2064   <S {Clo}.> She loues another. Who calles, ha?
2065  *<S {Mal}.> Good foole, as euer thou wilt deserue well at
2066  *my hand, helpe me to a Candle, and pen, inke, and paper:
2067  *as I am a Gentleman, I will liue to bee thankefull to thee
2068   for't.
2069   <S {Clo}.> M[aster]. {Maluolio}?
2070   <S {Mal}.> #I good Foole.
2071   <S {Clo}.> Alas sir, how fell you besides your fiue witts?
2072  *<S {Mall}.> Foole, there was neuer man so notoriouslie a-bus'd:
2073   I am as well in my wits (foole) as thou art.
2074  *<S {Clo}.> But as well: then you are mad indeede, if you be
2075   no better in your wits then a foole.
2076  *<S {Mal}.> They haue heere propertied me: keepe mee in
2077  *darkenesse, send Ministers to me, Asses, and doe all they
2078   can to face me out of my wits.
2079   <S {Clo}.> Aduise you what you say: the Minister is heere.
2080  *{Maluolio}, {Maluolio}, thy wittes the heauens restore: en-deauour
2081  *thy selfe to sleepe, and leaue thy vaine bibble
2082   babble.
2083   <S {Mal}.> Sir {Topas}.
2084   <S {Clo}.> Maintaine no words with him good fellow.
2085  *Who I sir, not I sir. God buy you good sir Topas: Mar-ry
2086   Amen. I will sir, I will.
2087   <S {Mal}.> Foole, foole, foole I say.
2088  *<S {Clo}.> Alas sir be patient. What say you sir, I am shent
2089   for speaking to you.
2090  *<S {Mal}.> Good foole, helpe me to some light, and some
2091  *paper, I tell thee I am as well in my wittes, as any man in
2092   Illyria.
2093   <S {Clo}.> Well- a- day, that you were sir.
2094  *<S {Mal}.> By this hand I am: good foole, some inke, pa-per,
2095  *and light: and conuey what I will set downe to my
2096  *Lady: it shall aduantage thee more, then euer the bea-ring
2097   of Letter did.
2098  *<S {Clo}.> I will help you too't. But tel me true, are you not
2099   mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit.
2100   <S {Mal}.> Beleeue me I am not, I tell thee true.
2101  *<S {Clo}.> Nay, Ile nere beleeue a madman till I see his brains
2102   I will fetch you light, and paper, and inke.
2103   <S {Mal}.> Foole, Ile requite it in the highest degree:
2104   I prethee be gone.
2105   <S {Clo}.> I am gone sir, and anon sir,
2106   Ile be with you againe:
2107   In a trice, like to the old vice,
2108   your neede to sustaine.
2109   Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,
2110   cries ah ha, to the diuell:
2111   Like a mad lad, paire thy nayles dad,
2112   Adieu good man diuell.  <D {Exit}>
2113   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
2114   <D {Enter Sebastian}.>
2115   This is the ayre, that is the glorious Sunne,
2116   This pearle she gaue me, I do feel't, and see't,
2117   And though tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
      <P Z4v>
2118   Yet 'tis not madnesse. Where's {Anthonio} then,
2119   I could not finde him at the Elephant,
2120   Yet there he was, and there I found this credite,
2121   That he did range the towne to seeke me out,
2122   His councell now might do me golden seruice,
2123   For though my soule disputes well with my sence,
2124   That this may be some error, but no madnesse,
2125   Yet doth this accident and flood of Fortune,
2126   So farre exceed all instance, all discourse,
2127   That I am readie to distrust mine eyes,
2128   And wrangle with my reason that perswades me
2129   To any other trust, but that I am mad,
2130   Or else the Ladies mad; yet if 'twere so,
2131   She could not sway her house, command her followers,
2132   Take, and giue backe affayres, and their dispatch,
2133   With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
2134   As I perceiue she do's: there's something in't
2135   That is deceiueable. But heere the Lady comes.
2136   <D {Enter Oliuia, and Priest}.>
2137   <S {Ol}.> Blame not this haste of mine: if you meane well
2138   Now go with me, and with this holy man
2139   Into  the Chantry by: there before him,
2140   And vnderneath that consecrated roofe,
2141   Plight me the full assurance of your faith,
2142   That my most iealious, and too doubtfull soule
2143   May liue at peace. He shall conceale it,
2144   Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
2145   What time we will our celebration keepe
2146   According to my birth, what do you say?
2147   <S {Seb}.> Ile follow this good man, and go with you,
2148   And hauing sworne truth, euer will be true.
2149  *<S {Ol}.> Then lead the way good father, & heauens so shine,
2150   That they may fairely note this acte of mine.  <D {Exeunt}>.
2151   <Z {Finis Actus Quartus}.>
2152   <Z {Actus Quintus. Scena Prima}.>
2153   <D {Enter Clowne and Fabian}.>
2154   <S {Fab}.> Now as thou lou'st me, let me see his Letter.
2155   <S {Clo}.> Good M[aster]. {Fabian}, grant me another request.
2156   <S {Fab}.> Any thing.
2157   <S {Clo}.> Do not desire to see this Letter.
2158  *<S {Fab}.> This is to giue a dogge, and in recompence desire
2159   my dogge againe.
2160   <D {Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and Lords}.>
2161   <S {Duke}.> Belong you to the Lady {Oliuia}, friends?
2162   <S {Clo}.> #I sir, we are some of her trappings.
2163   <S {Duke}.> I know thee well: how doest thou my good
2164   Fellow?
2165  *<S {Clo}.> Truely sir, the better for my foes, and the worse
2166   for my friends.
2167   <S {Du}.> Iust the contrary: the better for thy friends.
2168   <S {Clo}.> No sir, the worse.
2169   <S {Du}.> How can that be?
2170  *<S {Clo}.> Marry sir, they praise me, and make an asse of me,
2171  *now my foes tell me plainly, I am an Asse: so that by my
2172  *foes sir, I profit in the knowledge of my selfe, and by my
2173  *friends I am abused: so that conclusions to be as kisses, if
2174  *your foure negatiues make your two affirmatiues, why
2175  *then the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.
2176   <S {Du}.> Why this is excellent.
2177  *<S {Clo}.> By my troth sir, no: though it please you to be
2178   one of my friends.
2179  *<S {Du}.> Thou shalt not be the worse for me, there's gold.
2180  *<S {Clo}.> But that it would be double dealing sir, I would
2181   you could make it another.
2182   <S {Du}.> O you giue me #ill counsell.
2183   <S {Clo}.> Put your grace in your pocket sir, for this once,
2184   and let your flesh and blood obey it.
2185   <S {Du}.> Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double
2186   dealer: there's another.
2187  *<S {Clo}.> {Primo, secundo, tertio}, is a good play, and the olde
2188  *saying is, the third payes for all: the triplex sir, is a good
2189  *tripping measure, or the belles of S[aint]. {Bennet} sir, may put
2190   you in minde, one, two, three.
2191  *<S {Du}.> You can foole no more money out of mee at this
2192  *throw: if you will let your Lady know I am here to speak
2193  *with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my
2194   bounty further.
2195  *<S {Clo}.> Marry sir, lullaby to your bountie till I come a-gen.
2196  *I go sir, but I would not haue you to thinke, that
2197  *my desire of hauing is the sinne of couetousnesse: but as
2198  *you say sir, let your bounty take a nappe, I will awake it
2199   anon.  <D {Exit}>
2200   <D {Enter Anthonio and Officers}.>
2201   <S {Vio}.> Here comes the man sir, that did rescue mee.
2202   <S {Du}.> That face of his I do remember well,
2203   Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
2204   As blacke as Vulcan, in the smoake of warre:
2205   A bawbling Vessell was he Captaine of,
2206   For shallow draught and bulke vnprizable,
2207   With which such scathfull grapple did he make,
2208   With the most noble bottome of our Fleete,
2209   That very enuy, and the tongue of losse
2210   Cride fame and honor on him: What's the matter?
2211   <S 1.{Offi}.>  {Orsino}, this is that {Anthonio}
2212   That tooke the {Phoenix}, and her fraught from {Candy},
2213   And this is he that did the {Tiger} boord,
2214   When your yong Nephew {Titus} lost his legge;
2215   Heere in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
2216   In priuate brabble did we apprehend him.
2217   <S {Vio}.> He did me kindnesse sir, drew on my side,
2218   But in conclusion put strange speech vpon me,
2219   I know not what 'twas, but distraction.
2220   <S {Du}.> Notable Pyrate, thou salt- water Theefe,
2221   What foolish boldnesse brought thee to their mercies,
2222   Whom thou in termes so bloudie, and so deere
2223   Hast made thine enemies?
2224   <S {Ant}.> {Orsino}: Noble sir,
2225   Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you giue mee:
2226   {Anthonio} neuer yet was Theefe, or Pyrate,
2227   Though I confesse, on base and ground enough
2228   {Orsino's} enemie. A witchcraft drew me hither:
2229   That most ingratefull boy there by your side,
2230   From the rude seas enrag'd and foamy mouth
2231   Did I redeeme: a wracke past hope he was:
2232   His life I gaue him, and did thereto adde
2233   My loue without retention, or restraint,
2234   All his in dedication. For his sake,
2235   Did I expose my selfe (pure for his loue)
2236   Into the danger of this aduerse Towne,
2237   Drew to defend him, when he was beset:
2238   Where being apprehended, his false cunning
2239   (Not meaning to partake with me in danger)
2240   Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
      <P Z5>
2241   And grew a twentie yeeres remoued thing
2242   While one would winke: denide me mine owne purse,
2243   Which I had recommended to his vse,
2244   Not halfe an houre before.
2245   <S {Vio}.> How can this be?
2246   <S {Du}.> When came he to this Towne?
2247  *<S {Ant}.> To day my Lord: and for three months before,
2248   No {intrim}, not a minutes vacancie,
2249   Both day and night did we keepe companie.
2250   <D {Enter Oliuia and attendants}.>
2251  *<S {Du}.> Heere comes the Countesse, now heauen walkes
2252   on earth:
2253   But for thee fellow, fellow thy words are madnesse,
2254   Three monthes this youth hath tended vpon mee,
2255   But more of that anon. Take him aside.
2256  *<S {Ol}.> What would my Lord, but that he may not haue,
2257   Wherein {Oliuia} may seeme seruiceable?
2258   {Cesario}, you do not keepe promise with me.
2259   <S {Vio}.> Madam:
2260   <S {Du}.> Gracious {Oliuia}.
2261   <S {Ol}.> What do you say {Cesario}? Good my Lord.
2262   <S {Vio}.> My Lord would speake, my dutie hushes me.
2263   <S {Ol}.> If it be ought to the old tune my Lord,
2264   It is as fat and fulsome to mine eare
2265   As howling after Musicke.
2266   <S {Du}.> Still so cruell?
2267   <S {Ol}.> Still so constant Lord.
2268   <S {Du}.> What to peruersenesse? you vnciuill Ladie
2269   To whose ingrate, and vnauspicious Altars
2270   My soule the faithfull'st offrings haue breath'd out
2271   That ere deuotion tender'd. What shall I do?
2272  *<S {Ol}.> Euen what it please my Lord, that shal becom him
2273   <S {Du}.> Why should I not, (had I the heart to do it)
2274   Like to th' Egyptian theefe, at point of death
2275   Kill what I loue: (a sauage iealousie,
2276   That sometime sauours nobly) but heare me this:
2277   Since you to non- regardance cast my faith,
2278   And that I partly know the instrument
2279   That screwes me from my true place in your fauour:
2280   Liue you the Marble- brested Tirant still.
2281   But this your Minion, whom I know you loue,
2282   And whom, by heauen I sweare, I tender deerely,
2283   Him will I teare out of that cruell eye,
2284   Where he sits crowned in his masters spight.
2285   Come boy with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischiefe:
2286   Ile sacrifice the Lambe that I do loue,
2287   To spight a Rauens heart within a Doue.
2288   <S {Vio}.> And I most iocund, apt, and willinglie,
2289   To do you rest, a thousand deaths would dye.
2290   <S {Ol}.> Where goes {Cesario}?
2291   <S {Vio}.> After him I loue,
2292   More then I loue these eyes, more then my life,
2293   More by all mores, then ere I shall loue wife.
2294   If I do feigne, you witnesses aboue
2295   Punish my life, for tainting of my loue.
2296   <S {Ol}.> Aye me detested, how am I beguil'd?
2297  *<S {Vio}.> Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
2298   <S {Ol}.> Hast thou forgot thy selfe? Is it so long?
2299   Call forth the holy Father.
2300   <S {Du}.> Come, away.
2301   <S {Ol}.> Whether my Lord? {Cesario}, Husband, stay.
2302   <S {Du}.> Husband?
2303   <S {Ol}.> #I Husband. Can he that deny?
2304   <S {Du}.> Her husband, sirrah?
2305   <S {Vio}.> No my Lord, not I.
2306   <S {Ol}.> Alas, it is the basenesse of thy feare,
2307   That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
2308   Feare not {Cesario}, take thy fortunes vp,
2309   Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
2310   As great as that thou fear'st.
2311   <D {Enter Priest}.>
2312   O welcome Father:
2313   Father, I charge thee by thy reuerence
2314   Heere to vnfold, though lately we intended
2315   To keepe in darkenesse, what occasion now
2316   Reueales before 'tis ripe: what thou dost know
2317   Hath newly past, betweene this youth, and me.
2318   <S {Priest}.> A Contract of eternall bond of loue,
2319   Confirm'd by mutuall ioynder of your hands,
2320   Attested by the holy close of lippes,
2321   Strengthned by enterchangement of your rings,
2322   And all the Ceremonie of this compact
2323   Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
2324   Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my graue
2325   I haue trauail'd but two houres.
2326   <S {Du}.> O thou dissembling Cub: what wilt thou be
2327   When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
2328   Or will not else thy craft so quickely grow,
2329   That thine owne trip shall be thine ouerthrow:
2330   Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feete,
2331   Where thou, and I (henceforth) may neuer meet.
2332   <S {Vio}.> My Lord, I do protest.
2333   <S {Ol}.> O do not sweare,
2334   Hold little faith, though thou hast too much feare.
2335   <D {Enter Sir Andrew}.>
2336  *<S {And}.> For the loue of God a Surgeon, send one pre-sently
2337   to sir {Toby}.
2338   <S {Ol}.> What's the matter?
2339  *<S {And}.> #H'as broke my head a-crosse, and has giuen Sir
2340  *<S {Toby}> a bloody Coxcombe too: for the loue of God your
2341   helpe, I had rather then forty pound I were at home.
2342   <S {Ol}.> Who has done this sir {Andrew}?
2343  *<S {And}.> The Counts Gentleman, one {Cesario}: we tooke
2344  *him for a Coward, but hee's the verie diuell, incardinate.
2345   <S {Du}.> My Gentleman {Cesario}?
2346  *<S {And}.> Odd's lifelings heere he is: you broke my head
2347  *for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do't by sir
2348   {Toby}.
2349   <S {Vio}.> Why do you speake to me, I neuer hurt you:
2350   You drew your sword vpon me without cause,
2351   But I bespake you faire, and hurt you not.
2352   <D {Enter Toby and Clowne}.>
2353  *<S {And}.> If a bloody coxcombe be a hurt, you haue hurt
2354   me: I thinke you set nothing by a bloody Coxecombe.
2355  *Heere comes sir {Toby} halting, you shall heare more: but if
2356  *he had not beene in drinke, hee would haue tickel'd you
2357   other gates then he did.
2358   <S {Du}.> How now Gentleman? how ist with you?
2359  *<S {To}.> That's all one, #has hurt me, and there's th' end on't:
2360   Sot, didst see Dicke Surgeon, sot?
2361  *<S {Clo}.> O he's drunke sir {Toby} an houre agone: his eyes
2362   were set at eight i'th morning.
2363  *<S {To}.> Then he's a Rogue, and a passy measures pauyn: I
2364   hate a drunken rogue.
2365   <S {Ol}.> Away with him? Who hath made this hauocke
2366   with them?
2367  *<S {And}.> Ile helpe you sir {Toby}, because #we'll be drest to-gether.
2368  _
2369  *<S {To}.> Will you helpe an Asse- head, and a coxcombe, &
2370   a knaue: a thin fac'd knaue, a gull?
      <P Z5v>
2371   <S {Ol}.> Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd #too.
2372   <D {Enter Sebastian}.>
2373   <S {Seb}.> I am sorry Madam I haue hurt your kinsman:
2374   But had it beene the brother of my blood,
2375   I must haue done no lesse with wit and safety.
2376   You throw a strange regard vpon me, and by that
2377   I do perceiue it hath offended you:
2378   Pardon me (sweet one) euen for the vowes
2379   We made each other, but so late ago.
2380  *<S {Du}.> One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
2381   A naturall Perspectiue, that is, and is not.
2382   <S {Seb}.> {Anthonio}: O my deere {Anthonio},
2383   How haue the houres rack'd, and tortur'd me,
2384   Since I haue lost thee?
2385   <S {Ant}.> {Sebastian} are you?
2386   <S {Seb}.> Fear'st thou that {Anthonio}?
2387   <S {Ant}.> How haue you made diuision of your selfe,
2388   An apple cleft in two, is not more twin
2389   Then these two creatures. Which is {Sebastian}?
2390   <S {Ol}.> Most wonderfull.
2391   <S {Seb}.> Do I stand there? I neuer had a brother:
2392   Nor can there be that Deity in my nature
2393   Of heere, and euery where. I had a sister,
2394   Whom the blinde waues and surges haue deuour'd:
2395   Of charity, what kinne are you to me?
2396   What Countreyman? What name? What Parentage?
2397   <S {Vio}.> Of {Messaline}: {Sebastian} was my Father,
2398   Such a {Sebastian} was my brother too:
2399   So went he suited to his watery tombe:
2400   If spirits can assume both forme and suite,
2401   You come to fright vs.
2402   <S {Seb}.> A spirit I am indeed,
2403   But am in that dimension grossely clad,
2404   Which from the wombe I did participate.
2405   Were you a woman, as the rest goes euen,
2406   I should my teares let fall vpon your cheeke,
2407   And say, thrice welcome drowned {Viola}.
2408   <S {Vio}.> My father had a moale vpon his brow.
2409   <S {Seb}.> And so had mine.
2410   <S {Vio}.> And dide that day when {Viola} from her birth
2411   Had numbred thirteene yeares.
2412   <S {Seb}.> O that record is liuely in my soule,
2413   He finished indeed his mortall acte
2414   That day that made my sister thirteene yeares.
2415   <S {Vio}.> If nothing lets to make vs happie both,
2416   But this my masculine vsurp'd attyre:
2417   Do not embrace me, till each circumstance,
2418   Of place, time, fortune, do co-here and iumpe
2419   That I am {Viola}, which to confirme,
2420   Ile bring you to a Captaine in this Towne,
2421   Where lye my maiden weeds: by whose gentle helpe,
2422   I was preseru'd to serue this Noble Count:
2423   All the occurrence of my fortune since
2424   Hath beene betweene this Lady, and this Lord.
2425   <S {Seb}.> So comes it Lady, you haue beene mistooke:
2426   But Nature to her bias drew in that.
2427   You would haue bin contracted to a Maid,
2428   Nor are you therein (by my life) deceiu'd,
2429   You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
2430   <S {Du}.> Be not amaz'd, right noble is his blood:
2431   If this be so, as yet the glasse seemes true,
2432   I shall haue share in this most happy wracke,
2433   Boy, thou hast saide to me a thousand times,
2434   Thou neuer should'st loue woman like to me.
2435   <S {Vio}.> And all those sayings, will I ouer sweare,
2436   And all those swearings keepe as true in soule,
2437   As doth that Orbed Continent, the fire,
2438   That seuers day from night.
2439   <S {Du}.> Giue me thy hand,
2440   And let me see thee in thy womans weedes.
2441   <S {Vio}.> The Captaine that did bring me first on shore
2442   Hath my Maides garments: he vpon some Action
2443   Is now in durance, at {Maluolio's} suite,
2444   a Gentleman, and follower of my Ladies.
2445   <S {Ol}.> He shall inlarge him: fetch {Maluolio} hither,
2446   And yet alas, now I remember me,
2447   They say poore Gentleman, he's much distract.
2448   <D {Enter Clowne with a Letter, and Fabian}.>
2449   A most extracting frensie of mine owne
2450   From my remembrance, clearly banisht his.
2451   How does he sirrah?
2452  *<S {Cl}.> Truely Madam, he holds {Belzebub} at the staues end as
2453  *well as a man in his case may do: has heere writ a letter to
2454  *you, I should haue giuen't you to day morning. But as a
2455  *madmans Epistles are no Gospels, so it skilles not much
2456   when they are deliuer'd.
2457   <S {Ol}.> Open't, and read it.
2458   <S {Clo}.> Looke then to be well edified, when the Foole
2459   deliuers the Madman. {By the Lord Madam}.
2460   <S {Ol}.> How now, art thou mad?
2461  *<S {Clo}.> No Madam, I do but reade madnesse: #and your
2462  *Ladyship will haue it as it ought to bee, you must allow
2463   {Vox}.
2464   <S {Ol}.> Prethee reade i'thy right wits.
2465  *<S {Clo}.> So I do Madona: but to reade his right wits, is to
2466  *reade thus: therefore, perpend my Princesse, and giue
2467   eare.
2468   <S {Ol}.> Read it you, sirrah.
2469  *<S {Fab}. {Reads}.> By the Lord Madam, you wrong me, and
2470  *the world shall know it: Though you haue put mee into
2471  *darkenesse, and giuen your drunken Cosine rule ouer me,
2472  *yet haue I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladie-ship.
2473  *I haue your owne letter, that induced mee to the
2474  *semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not, but to
2475  *do my selfe much right, or you much shame: thinke of
2476  *me as you please. I leaue my duty a little vnthought of,
2477   and speake out of my iniury.  {The madly vs'd Maluolio}.
2478   <S {Ol}.> Did he write this?
2479   <S {Clo}.> #I Madame.
2480   <S {Du}.> This sauours not much of distraction.
2481   <S {Ol}.> See him deliuer'd {Fabian}, bring him hither:
2482  *My Lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
2483   To thinke me as well a sister, as a wife,
2484   One day shall crowne th' alliance on't, so please you,
2485   Heere at my house, and at my proper cost.
2486   <S {Du}.> Madam, I am most apt t' embrace your offer:
2487   Your Master quits you: and for your seruice done him,
2488   So much against the mettle of your sex,
2489   So farre beneath your soft and tender breeding,
2490   And since you call'd me Master, for so long:
2491   Heere is my hand, you shall from this time bee
2492   Your Masters Mistris.
2493   <S {Ol}.> A sister, you are she.
2494   <D {Enter Maluolio}.>
2495   <S {Du}.> Is this the Madman?
2496   <S {Ol}.> #I my Lord, this same: How now {Maluolio}?
2497   <S {Mal}.> Madam, you haue done me wrong,
2498   Notorious wrong.
2499   <S {Ol}.> Haue I {Maluolio}? No.
2500   <S {Mal}.> Lady you haue, pray you peruse that Letter.
2501   You must not now denie it is your hand,
2502   Write from it if you can, in hand, or phrase,
      <P Z6>
2503   Or say, tis not your seale, not your inuention:
2504   You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
2505   And tell me in the modestie of honor,
2506   Why you haue giuen me such cleare lights of fauour,
2507   Bad me come smiling, and crosse- garter'd to you,
2508   To put on yellow stockings, and to frowne
2509   Vpon sir {Toby}, and the lighter people:
2510   And acting this in an obedient hope,
2511   Why haue you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
2512   Kept in a darke house, visited by the Priest,
2513   And made the most notorious gecke and gull,
2514   That ere inuention plaid on? Tell me why?
2515   <S {Ol}.> Alas {Maluolio}, this is not my writing,
2516   Though I confesse much like the Charracter:
2517   But out of question, tis {Marias} hand.
2518   And now I do bethinke me, it was shee
2519   First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
2520   And in such formes, which heere were presuppos'd
2521   Vpon thee in the Letter: prethee be content,
2522   This practice hath most shrewdly past vpon thee:
2523   But when we know the grounds, and authors of it,
2524   Thou shalt be both the Plaintiffe and the Iudge
2525   Of thine owne cause.
2526   <S {Fab}.> Good Madam heare me speake,
2527   And let no quarrell, nor no braule to come,
2528   Taint the condition of this present houre,
2529   Which I haue wondred at. In hope it shall not,
2530   Most freely I confesse my selfe, and {Toby}
2531   Set this deuice against {Maluolio} heere,
2532   Vpon some stubborne and vncourteous parts
2533   We had conceiu'd against him. {Maria} writ
2534   The Letter, at sir {Tobyes} great importance,
2535   In recompence whereof, he hath married her:
2536   How with a sportfull malice it was follow'd,
2537   May rather plucke on laughter then reuenge,
2538   If that the iniuries be iustly weigh'd,
2539   That haue on both sides past.
2540   <S {Ol}.> Alas poore Foole, how haue they baffel'd thee?
2541  *<S {Clo}.> Why some are borne great, some atchieue great-nesse,
2542  *#and some haue greatnesse throwne vpon them. I
2543  *was one sir, in this Enterlude, one sir {Topas} sir, but that's
2544  *all one: By the Lord Foole, I am not mad: but do you re-member,
2545  *Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascall,
2546  *and you smile not he's gag'd: and thus the whirlegigge
2547   of time, brings in his reuenges.
2548   <S {Mal}.> Ile be reueng'd on the whole packe of you?
2549   <S {Ol}.> He hath bene most notoriously abus'd.
2550   <S {Du}.> Pursue him, and entreate him to a peace:
2551   He hath not told vs of the Captaine yet,
2552   When that is knowne, and golden time conuents
2553   A solemne Combination shall be made
2554   Of our deere soules. Meane time sweet sister,
2555   We will not part from hence. {Cesario} come
2556   (For so you shall be while you are a man:)
2557   But when in other habites you are seene,
2558   {Orsino's} Mistris, and his fancies Queene.  <D {Exeunt}>
2559   <S {Clowne sings}>.
2560   {When that I was #and a little tine boy},
2561   {with hey, ho, the winde and the raine:}
2562   {A foolish thing was but a toy},
2563   {for the raine it raineth euery day}.
2564   {But when I came to mans estate},
2565   {with hey ho, &c}.
2566   {Gainst Knaues and Theeues men shut their gate},
2567   {for the raine, &c}.
2568   {But when I came alas to wiue},
2569   {with hey ho, &c}.
2570   {By swaggering could I neuer thriue},
2571   {for the raine, &c}.
2572   {But when I came vnto my beds},
2573   {with hey ho, &c}.
2574   {With tospottes still had drunken heades},
2575   {for the raine, &c}.
2576   {A great while ago the world begon},
2577   {hey ho, &c}.
2578   {But that's all one, our Play is done},
2579   {and wee'l striue to please you euery day}.
