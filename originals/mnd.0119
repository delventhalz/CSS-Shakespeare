1      <Z {Actus  primus}.>
2      <D {Enter Theseus, Hippolita, with others}.>
3      <S {Theseus}.>
4      Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre
5     *Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in
6     *Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow
7     *This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires
8      Like to a Step- dame, or a Dowager,
9      Long withering out a yong mans reuennew.
10    *<S {Hip}.> Foure daies wil quickly steep the[m]selues in nights
11     Foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time:
12     And then the Moone, like to a siluer bow,
13     Now bent in heauen, shal behold the night
14     Of our solemnities.
15     <S {The}.> Go {Philostrate},
16     Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments,
17     Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
18     Turne melancholy forth to Funerals:
19     The pale companion is not for our pompe,
20     Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword,
21     And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries:
22     But I will wed thee in another key,
23     With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.
24     <D {Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, Lysander},
25     {and Demetrius}.>
26     <S {Ege}.> Happy be {Theseus}, our renowned Duke.
27    *<S {The}.> Thanks good {Egeus}: what's the news with thee?
28     <S {Ege}.> Full of vexation, come I, with complaint
29     Against my childe, my daughter Hermia.
30     <D {Stand forth Demetrius}.>
31     My Noble Lord,
32     This man hath my consent to marrie her.
33     <D {Stand forth Lysander}.>
34     And my gracious Duke,
35     This man hath bewitch'd the bosome of my childe:
36     Thou, thou {Lysander}, thou hast giuen her rimes,
37     And interchang'd loue- tokens with my childe:
38     Thou hast by Moone- light at her window sung,
39     With faining voice, verses of faining loue,
40     And stolne the impression of her fantasie,
41     With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits,
42     Knackes, trifles, Nose- gaies, sweet meats (messengers
43     Of strong preuailment in vnhardned youth)
44     With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughters heart,
45     Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me)
46     To stubborne harshnesse. And my gracious Duke,
47     Be it so she will not heere before your Grace,
48     Consent to marrie with {Demetrius},
49     I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens;
50     As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
51     Which shall be either to this Gentleman,
52     Or to her death, according to our Law,
53     Immediately prouided in that case.
54    *<S {The}.> What say you Hermia? be aduis'd faire Maide,
55     To you your Father should be as a God;
56     One that compos'd your beauties; yea and one
57     To whom you are but as a forme in waxe
58     By him imprinted: and within his power,
59     To leaue the figure, or disfigure it:
60     {Demetrius} is a worthy Gentleman.
61     <S {Her}.> So is {Lysander}.
62     <S {The}.> In himselfe he is.
63     But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce,
64     The other must be held the worthier.
65     <S {Her}.> I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
66    *<S {The}.> Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke.
67     <S {Her}.> I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
68     I know not by what power I am made bold,
69     Nor how it may concerne my modestie
70     In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts:
71     But I beseech your Grace, that I may know
72     The worst that may befall me in this case,
73     If I refuse to wed {Demetrius}.
74     <S {The}.> Either to dye the death, or to abiure
75     For euer the society of men.
76     Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,
77     Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
78     Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice)
79     You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne,
80     For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,
81     To liue a barren sister all your life,
82     Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone,
83     Thrice blessed they that master so their blood,
84     To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage,
85     But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd,
86     Then that which withering on the virgin thorne,
87     Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse.
      <P N1v>
88     <S {Her}.> So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord,
89     Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp
90     Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake,
91     My soule consents not to giue soueraignty.
92    *<S {The}.> Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon
93     The sealing day betwixt my loue and me,
94     For euerlasting bond of fellowship:
95     Vpon that day either prepare to dye,
96     For disobedience to your fathers #will,
97     Or else to wed {Demetrius} as hee would,
98     Or on {Dianaes} Altar to protest
99     For aie, austerity, and single life.
100    <S {Dem}.> Relent sweet {Hermia}, and {Lysander}, yeelde
101    Thy crazed title to my certaine right.
102    <S {Lys}.> You haue her fathers loue, {Demetrius}:
103    Let me haue {Hermiaes}: do you marry him.
104    <S {Egeus}.> Scornfull {Lysander}, true, he hath my Loue;
105    And what is mine, my loue shall render him.
106    And she is mine, and all my right of her,
107    I do estate vnto {Demetrius}.
108    <S {Lys}.> I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,
109    As well possest: my loue is more then his:
110    My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
111    (If not with vantage) as {Demetrius}:
112    And (which is more then all these boasts can be)
113    I am belou'd of beauteous {Hermia}.
114    Why should not I then prosecute my right?
115    {Demetrius}, Ile auouch it to his head,
116    Made loue to {Nedars} daughter, {Helena},
117    And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes,
118    Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,
119    Vpon this spotted and inconstant man.
120    <S {The}.> I must confesse, that I haue heard so much,
121    And with {Demetrius} thought to haue spoke thereof:
122    But being ouer- full of selfe- affaires,
123    My minde did lose it. But {Demetrius} come,
124    And come {Egeus}, you shall go with me,
125    I haue some priuate schooling for you both.
126    For you faire {Hermia}, looke you arme your selfe,
127    To fit your fancies to your Fathers #will;
128    Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp
129    (Which by no meanes we may extenuate)
130    To death, or to a vow of single life.
131    Come my {Hippolita}, what cheare my loue?
132    {Demetrius} and {Egeus} go along:
133    I must imploy you in some businesse
134    Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you
135    Of something, neerely that concernes your selues.
136    <S {Ege}.> With dutie and desire we follow you.  <D {Exeunt}>
137    <D {Manet Lysander and Hermia}.>
138   *<S {Lys}.> How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale?
139    How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?
140    <S {Her}.> Belike for want of raine, which I could well
141    Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes.
142    <S {Lys}.> For ought that euer I could reade,
143    Could euer heare by tale or historie,
144    The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,
145    But either it was different in blood.
146    <S {Her}.> O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue.
147    <S {Lys}.> Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares.
148    <S {Her}.> O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong.
149    <S {Lys}.> Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit.
150    <S {Her}.> O #hell! to choose loue by anothers eie.
151    <S {Lys}.> Or if there were a simpathie in choise,
152    Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;
153    Making it momentarie, as a sound:
154    Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,
155    Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,
156    That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;
157    And ere a man hath power to say, behold,
158    The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:
159    So quicke bright things come to confusion.
160    <S {Her}.> If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,
161    It stands as an edict in destinie:
162    Then let vs teach our triall patience,
163    Because it is a customarie crosse,
164    As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,
165    Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers.
166   *<S {Lys}.> A good perswasion; therefore heare me {Hermia},
167    I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,
168    Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,
169    From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,
170    And she respects me, as her onely sonne:
171    There gentle {Hermia}, may I marrie thee,
172    And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law
173    Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then
174    Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:
175    And in the wood, a league without the towne,
176    (Where I did meete   thee once with {Helena}.
177    To do obseruance for a morne of #May)
178    There will I stay for thee.
179    <S {Her}.> My good {Lysander},
180    I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,
181    By his best arrow with the golden head,
182    By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,
183    By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,
184    And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,
185    When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,
186    By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,
187    (In number more then euer women spoke)
188    In that same place thou hast appointed me,
189    To morrow truly will I meete with thee.
190   *<S {Lys}.> Keepe promise loue: looke here comes {Helena}.
191    <D {Enter Helena}.>
192    <S {Her}.> God speede faire {Helena}, whither away?
193    <S {Hel}.> Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,
194    {Demetrius} loues you faire: O happie faire!
195    Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre
196    More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,
197   *When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,
198    Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,
199    Your words I catch, faire {Hermia} ere I go,
200    My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,
201    My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,
202    Were the world mine, {Demetrius} being bated,
203    The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.
204    O teach me how you looke, and with what #art
205    You sway the motion of {Demetrius} hart.
206    <S {Her}.> I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still.
207    <S {Hel}.> O that your frownes would teach my smiles
208    such skil.
209    <S {Her}.> I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue.
210   *<S {Hel}.> O that my prayers could such affection mooue.
211    <S {Her}.> The more I hate, the more he followes me.
212    <S {Hel}.> The more I loue, the more he hateth me.
213    <S {Her}.> His folly Helena is none of mine.
214   *<S {Hel}.> None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine
215    <S {Her}.> Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,
216    {Lysander} and my selfe will flie this place.
217    Before the time I did {Lysander} see,
218    Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.
      <P N2><C C>
219    O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,
220    That he hath turn'd a heauen into #hell.
221    <S {Lys}.> {Helen}, to you our mindes we will vnfold,
222    To morrow night, when {Phoebe} doth behold
223    Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,
224    Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse
225    (A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)
226    Through {Athens} gates, haue we deuis'd to steale.
227    <S {Her}.> And in the wood, where often you and I,
228    Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,
229    Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:
230    There my {Lysander}, and my selfe shall meete,
231    And thence from {Athens} turne away our eyes
232    To seeke new friends and strange companions,
233    Farwell sweet play- fellow, pray thou for vs,
234    And good lucke grant thee thy {Demetrius}.
235    Keepe word {Lysander} we must starue our sight,
236    From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.
237    <D {Exit Hermia}.>
238    <S {Lys}.> I will my {Hermia}. {Helena} adieu,
239    As you on him, {Demetrius} dotes on you. <D {Exit Lysander}.>
240    <S {Hele}.> How happy some, ore othersome can be?
241    Through {Athens} I am thought as faire as she.
242    But what of that? {Demetrius} thinkes not so:
243    He will not know, what all, but he doth know,
244    And as hee erres, doting on {Hermias} eyes;
245    So I, admiring of his qualities:
246    Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,
247    Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,
248    Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,
249    And therefore is wing'd {Cupid} painted blinde.
250    Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:
251    Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.
252    And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,
253    Because in choise he is often beguil'd,
254    As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;
255    So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.
256    For ere {Demetrius} lookt on {Hermias} eyne,
257    He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.
258    And when this Haile some heat from {Hermia} felt,
259    So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,
260    I will goe tell him of faire {Hermias} flight:
261    Then to the wood will he, to morrow night
262    Pursue her; and for his intelligence,
263    If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:
264    But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,
265    To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.  <D {Exit}.>
266   *<D {Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the}
267   *{Weauer, Flute the bellowes- mender, Snout the Tinker, and}
268    {Starueling the Taylor}.>
269    <S {Quin}.> Is all our company heere?
270   *<S {Bot}.> You were best to call them generally, man by
271    man according to the scrip.
272   *<S {Qui}.> Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which
273   *is thought fit through all {Athens}, to play in our Enter-lude
274   *before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding
275    day at night.
276   *<S {Bot}.> First, good {Peter Quince}, say what the play treats
277   *on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on
278    to a point.
279   *<S {Quin}.> Marry our play is the most lamentable come-dy,
280    and most cruell death of {Pyramus} and {Thisbie}.
281   *<S {Bot}.> A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a
282   *merry. Now good {Peter Quince}, call forth your Actors
283    by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues.
284   *<S {Quince}.> Answere as I call you. {Nick Bottome} the
285    Weauer.
286   *<S {Bottome}.> Ready; name what part I am for, and
287    proceed.
288   *<S {Quince}.> You {Nicke Bottome} are set downe for {Py-ramus}.
289   _
290    <S {Bot}.> What is {Pyramus}, a louer, or a tyrant?
291   *<S {Quin}.> A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for
292    loue.
293   *<S {Bot}.> That will aske some teares in the true perfor-ming
294   *of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:
295   *I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.
296   *To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could
297   *play {Ercles} rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all
298   *split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break
299   *the locks of prison gates, and {Phibbus} carre shall shine
300   *from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This
301   *was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This
302   *is {Ercles} vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condo-ling.
303   _
304    <S {Quin}.> {Francis Flute} the Bellowes- mender.
305    <S {Flu}.> Heere {Peter Quince}.
306    <S {Quin}.> You must take {Thisbie} on you.
307    <S {Flut}.> What is {Thisbie}, a wandring Knight?
308    <S {Quin}.> It is the Lady that {Pyramus} must loue.
309   *<S {Flut}.> Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a
310    beard comming.
311   *<S {Qui}.> That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and
312    you may speake as small as you will.
313   *<S {Bot}.> #And I may hide my face, let me play {Thisbie} too:
314   *Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; {Thisne}, {Thisne}, ah
315   *{Pyramus} my louer deare, thy {Thisbie} deare, and Lady
316    deare.
317   *<S {Quin}.> No no, you must play {Pyramus}, and {Flute}, you
318    {Thisby}.
319    <S {Bot}.> Well, proceed.
320    <S {Qu}.> {Robin Starueling} the Taylor.
321    <S {Star}.> Heere {Peter Quince}.
322   *<S {Quince}.> {Robin Starueling}, you must play {Thisbies}
323    mother?
324    {Tom Snowt}, the Tinker.
325    <S {Snowt}.> Heere {Peter Quince}.
326   *<S {Quin}.> you, {Pyramus} father; my self, {Thisbies} father;
327   *{Snugge} the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there
328    is a play fitted.
329   *<S {Snug}.> Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if
330    be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie.
331   *<S {Quin}.> You may doe it {extemporie}, for it is nothing
332    but roaring.
333   *<S {Bot}.> Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I
334   *will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,
335   *that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let
336    him roare againe.
337   *<S {Quin}.> If you should do it too terribly, you would
338   *fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would
339    shrike, and that were enough to hang us all.
340    <S {All}.> That would hang vs euery mothers sonne.
341   *<S {Bottome}.> I graunt you friends, if that you should
342   *fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would
343   *haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will ag-grauate
344   *my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as
345   *any sucking Doue; I will roare #and 'twere any Nightin-gale.
346   _
347   *<S {Quin}.> You can play no part but {Piramus}, for {Pira-mus}
      <P N2v><C B>
348   *is a sweet- fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in
349   *a summers day; a most louely Gentleman- like man, ther-fore
350    you must needs play {Piramus}.
351   *<S {Bot}.> Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I
352    best to play it in?
353    <S {Quin}.> Why, what you will.
354   *<S {Bot}.> I will discharge it, in either your straw- colour
355   *beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine
356   *beard, or your French- crowne colour'd beard, your per-fect
357    yellow.
358   *<S {Quin}.> Some of your French Crownes haue no haire
359   *at all, and then you will play bare- fac'd. But masters here
360   *are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and
361   *desire you, to con them by #too morrow night: and meet
362   *me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by
363   *Moone- light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in
364   *the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deui-ses
365   *knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of pro-perties,
366   *such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not.
367   *<S {Bottom}.> We will meete, and there we may rehearse
368   *more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be per-fect,
369    adieu.
370    <S {Quin}.> At the Dukes oake we meete.
371    <S {Bot}.> Enough, hold or cut bow- strings.  <D {Exeunt}>
372    <Z {Actus Secundus}.>
373    <D {Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin good-fellow}
374    {at another}.>
375    <S {Rob}.> How now spirit, whether wander you?
376   *<S {Fai}.> Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar,
377    Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire,
378   *I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere;
379   *And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the |(green.
380    The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee,
381    In their gold coats, spots you see,
382    Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors,
383    In those freckles, liue their sauors,
384    I must go seeke some dew drops heere,
385    And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare.
386    Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon,
387    Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon.
388   *<S {Rob}.> The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night,
389    Take heed the Queene come not within his sight,
390    For {Oberon} is passing fell and wrath,
391    Because that she, as her attendant, hath
392    A louely boy stolne from an Indian King,
393    She neuer had so sweet a changeling,
394    And iealous {Oberon} would haue the childe
395    Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde.
396    But she (perforce) with- holds the loued boy,
397    Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy.
398    And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene,
399    By fountaine cleere, or spangled star- light sheene,
400    But they do square, that all their Elues for feare
401    Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there.
402    <S {Fai}.> Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
403    Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit
404    Cal'd Robin Good- fellow. Are you not hee,
405    That frights the maidens of the Villagree,
406    Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne,
407    And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne,
408    And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme,
409    Misleade night- wanderers, laughing at their harme,
410    Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke,
411    You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke.
412    Are not you he?
413    <S {Rob}.> Thou speak'st aright;
414    I am that merrie wanderer of the night:
415    I iest to {Oberon}, and make him smile,
416    When I a fat and bean- fed horse beguile,
417    Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale,
418    And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole,
419    In very likenesse of a roasted crab:
420    And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob,
421    And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale.
422    The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale,
423    Sometime for three- foot stoole, mistaketh me,
424    Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she,
425    And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe.
426    And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe,
427    And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare,
428    A merrier houre was neuer wasted there.
429    But roome Fairy, heere comes {Oberon}.
430    <S {Fair}.> And heere my Mistris:
431    Would that he were gone.
432    <D {Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine},
433    {and the Queene at another with hers}.>
434    <S {Ob}.> #Ill met by Moone- light.
435    Proud {Tytania}.
436    <S {Qu}.> What, iealous {Oberon}? Fairy skip hence.
437    I haue forsworne his bed and companie.
438    <S {Ob}.> Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?
439    <S {Qu}.> Then I must be thy Lady: but I know
440    When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land,
441    And in the shape of {Corin}, sate all day,
442    Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue
443    To amorous {Phillida}. Why art thou heere
444    Come from the farthest steepe of {India}?
445    But that forsooth the bouncing {Amazon}
446    Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue,
447    To {Theseus} must be Wedded; and you come,
448    To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie.
449    <S {Ob}.> How canst thou thus for shame {Tytania}.
450    Glance at my credite, with {Hippolita}?
451    Knowing I know thy loue to {Theseus}?
452   *Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night
453    From {Peregenia}, whom he rauished?
454    And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith
455    With {Ariadne}, and {Antiopa}?
456    <S {Que}.> These are the forgeries of iealousie,
457    And neuer since the middle Summers spring
458    Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,
459    By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,
460    Or in the beached margent of the sea,
461    To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,
462    But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport.
463    Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,
464    As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea
465    Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,
466    Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud,
467    That they haue ouer- borne their Continents.
468    The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd   his yoake in vaine,
469    The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne
470    Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard:
471    The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
472    And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,
      <P N3><C C>
473    The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,
474    And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,
475    For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.
476    The humane mortals want their winter heere,
477    No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;
478    Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods)
479    Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;
480    That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.
481    And through this distemperature, we see
482    The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts
483    Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,
484    And on old {Hyems} chinne and Icie crowne,
485    An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds
486    Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer,
487    The childing Autumne, angry Winter change
488    Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,
489    By their increase, now knowes not which is which;
490    And this same progeny of euills,
491    Comes from our debate, from our dissention,
492    We are their parents and originall.
493    <S {Ober}.> Do you amend it then, it lies in you,
494    Why should {Titania} crosse her {Oberon}?
495    I do but beg a little changeling boy,
496    To be my Henchman.
497    <S {Qu}.> Set your heart at rest,
498    The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me,
499    His mother was a Votresse of my Order,
500    And in the spiced {Indian} aire, by night
501    Full often hath she gossipt by my side,
502    And sat with me on {Neptunes} yellow sands,
503    Marking th' embarked traders on the flood,
504    When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue,
505    And grow big bellied with the wanton winde:
506    Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,
507   *Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire)
508    Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,
509    To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,
510    As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.
511    But she being mortall, of that boy did die,
512    And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy,
513    And for her sake I will not part with him.
514    <S {Ob}.> How long within this wood intend you stay?
515    <S {Qu}.> Perchance till after {Theseus} wedding day.
516    If you will patiently dance in our Round,
517    And see our Moone- light reuels, goe with vs;
518    If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts.
519    <S {Ob}.> Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee.
520    <S {Qu}.> Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away:
521    We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay.  <D {Exeunt}.>
522   *<S {Ob}.> Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue,
523    Till I torment thee for this iniury.
524    My gentle {Pucke} come hither; thou remembrest
525    Since once I sat vpon a promontory,
526    And heard a Meare- maide on a Dolphins backe,
527    Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,
528    That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song,
529    And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares,
530    To heare the Sea- maids musicke.
531    <S {Puc}.> I remember.
532    <S {Ob}.> That very time I say (but thou couldst not)
533    Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth,
534    {Cupid} all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke
535    At a faire Vestall, throned by the West,
536    And loos'd his loue- shaft smartly from his bow,
537    As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,
538    But I might see young {Cupids} fiery shaft
539    Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone;
540    And the imperiall Votresse passed on,
541    In maiden meditation, fancy free.
542    Yet markt I where the bolt of {Cupid} fell.
543    It fell vpon a little westerne flower;
544    Before, milke- white: now purple with loues wound,
545    And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse.
546    Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once,
547    The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye- lids laid,
548    Will make or man or woman madly dote
549    Vpon the next liue creature that it sees.
550    Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,
551    Ere the {Leuiathan} can swim a league.
552   *<S {Pucke}.> Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty mi-nutes.
553   _
554    <S {Ober}.> Hauing once this iuyce,
555    Ile watch {Titania}, when she is asleepe,
556    And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
557    The next thing when she waking lookes vpon,
558    (Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull,
559    On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape)
560    Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.
561    And ere I take this charme off from her sight,
562    (As I can take it with another hearbe)
563    Ile make her render vp her Page to me.
564    But who comes heere? I am inuisible,
565    And I will ouer- heare their conference.
566    <D {Enter Demetrius, Helena following him}.>
567    <S {Deme}.> I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not,
568    Where is {Lysander}, and faire {Hermia}?
569    The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me.
570    Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood;
571    And heere am I, and wood within this wood,
572    Because I cannot meet my {Hermia}.
573    Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
574    <S {Hel}.> You draw me, you hard- hearted Adamant,
575    But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart
576    Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw,
577    And I shall haue no power to follow you.
578    <S {Deme}.> Do I entice you? do I speake you faire?
579    Or rather doe I not in plainest truth,
580    Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you?
581    <S {Hel}.> And euen for that doe I loue thee the more;
582    I am your spaniell, and {Demetrius},
583    The more you beat me, I will fawne on you.
584    Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me,
585    Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue
586    (Vnworthy as I am) to follow you.
587    What worser place can I beg in your loue,
588    (And yet a place of high respect with me)
589    Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge.
590    <S {Dem}.> Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
591    For I am sicke when I do looke on thee.
592    <S {Hel}.> And I am sicke when I looke not on you.
593    <S {Dem}.> You doe impeach your modesty too much,
594    To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe
595    Into the hands of one that loues you not,
596    To trust the opportunity of night.
597    And the #ill counsell of a desert place,
598    With the rich worth of your virginity.
599    <S {Hel}.> Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that
600    It is not night when I doe see your face.
601    Therefore I thinke I am not in the night,
602    Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company,
      <P N3v>
603    For you in my respect are all the world.
604    Then how can it be said I am alone,
605    When all the world is heere to looke on me?
606    <S {Dem}.> Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
607    And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts.
608    <S {Hel}.> The wildest hath not such a heart as you;
609    Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd:
610    {Apollo} flies and {Daphne} holds the chase;
611    The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde
612    Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede,
613    When cowardise pursues, and valour flies.
614    <S {Demet}.> I will not stay thy questions, let me go;
615    Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue,
616    But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood.
617    <S {Hel}.> #I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field
618    You doe me mischiefe. Fye {Demetrius},
619    Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe:
620    We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe;
621    We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe.
622    I follow thee, and make a heauen of #hell,
623    To die vpon the hand I loue so well.  <D {Exit}.>
624    <S {Ob}.> Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue,
625    Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue.
626    Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.
627    <D {Enter Pucke}.>
628    <S {Puck}.> #I there it is.
629    <S {Ob}.> I pray thee giue it me.
630    I know a banke where the wilde time blowes,
631    Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes,
632    Quite ouer- cannoped with luscious woodbine,
633    With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine;
634    There sleepes {Tytania}, sometime of the night,
635    Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:
636    And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,
637    Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.
638    And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,
639    And make her full of hatefull fantasies.
640    Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue;
641    A sweet {Athenian} Lady is in loue
642    With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,
643    But doe it when the next thing he espies,
644    May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,
645    By the {Athenian} garments he hath on.
646    Effect it with some care, that he may proue
647    More fond on her, then she vpon her loue;
648    And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow.
649   *<S {Pu}.> Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so.  <D {Exit}.>
650    <D {Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine}.>
651    <S {Queen}.> Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;
652    Then for the third part of a minute hence,
653    Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds,
654    Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings.
655    To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe
656    The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders
657    At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe,
658    Then to your offices, and let me rest.
659    <S {Fairies Sing}.>
660    {You spotted Snakes with double tongue},
661    {Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene},
662    {Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong},
663    {Come not neere our Fairy Queene}.
664    {Philomele with melodie},
665    {Sing in your sweet Lullaby}.
666    {Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby},
667    {Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme},
668    {Come our louely Lady nye},
669    {So good night with Lullaby}.
670    <S 2.{Fairy}.> {Weauing Spiders come not heere},
671    {Hence you long leg'd Spinners, hence:}
672    {Beetles blacke approach not neere;}
673    {Worme nor Snayle doe no offence}.
674    {Philomele with melody, &c}.
675    <S 1.{Fairy}.> {Hence away, now all is well;}
676    {One aloofe, stand Centinell}.  <D {Shee sleepes}.>
677    <D {Enter Oberon}.>
678    <S {Ober}.> What thou seest when thou dost wake,
679    Do it for thy true Loue take:
680    Loue and languish for his sake.
681    Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare,
682    Pard, or Boare with bristled haire,
683    In thy eye that shall appeare,
684    When thou wak'st, it is thy deare,
685    Wake when some vile thing is neere.
686    <D {Enter Lisander and Hermia}.>
687   *<S {Lis}.> Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods,
688    And to speake troth I haue forgot our way:
689    Wee'll rest vs {Hermia}, If you thinke it good,
690    And tarry for the comfort of the day.
691    <S {Her}.> Be it so {Lysander}; finde you out a bed,
692    For I vpon this banke will rest my head.
693    <S {Lys}.> One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both,
694    One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth.
695    <S {Her}.> Nay good {Lysander}, for my sake my deere
696    Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere.
697    <S {Lys}.> O take the sence sweet, of my innocence,
698    Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference,
699    I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit,
700    So that but one heart can you make of it.
701    Two bosomes interchanged with an oath,
702    So then two bosomes, and a single troth.
703    Then by your side, no bed- roome me deny,
704    For lying so, {Hermia}, I doe not lye.
705    <S {Her}.> {Lysander} riddles very prettily;
706    Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
707    If {Hermia} meant to say, {Lysander} lied.
708    But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie
709    Lie further off, in humane modesty,
710    Such separation, as may well be said,
711    Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,
712    So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend;
713    Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end.
714    <S {Lys}.> Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I,
715    And then end life, when I end loyalty:
716    Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest.
717   *<S {Her}.> With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest.
718    <D {Enter Pucke.  They sleepe}.>
719    <S {Puck}.> Through the Forest haue I gone,
720    But {Athenian} finde I none,
721    #One whose eyes I might approue
722    This flowers force in stirring loue.
723    Nigh and silence: who is heere?
724    Weedes of {Athens} he doth weare:
725    This is he (my master said)
726    Despised the {Athenian} maide:
727    And heere the maiden sleeping sound,
      <P N4><C D>
728    On the danke and durty ground.
729    Pretty soule, she durst not lye
730    Neere this lacke- loue, this kill- curtesie.
731    Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw
732    All the power this charme doth owe:
733    When thou wak'st, let loue forbid
734    Sleepe his seate on thy eye- lid.
735    So awake when I am gone:
736    For I must now to {Oberon}.  <D {Exit}.>
737    <D {Enter Demetrius and Helena running}.>
738    <S {Hel}.> Stay, though thou kill me, sweete {Demetrius}.
739    <S {De}.> I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus.
740    <S {Hel}.> O wilt thou darkling leaue me? do not so.
741    <S {De}.> Stay on thy perill, I alone will goe.
742    <D {Exit Demetrius}.>
743    <S {Hel}.> O I am out of breath, in this fond chace,
744    The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace,
745    Happy is {Hermia}, wheresoere she lies;
746    For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes.
747    How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares.
748    If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers.
749    No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare;
750    For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare,
751    Therefore no maruaile, though {Demetrius}
752    Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus.
753    What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine,
754    Made me compare with {Hermias} sphery eyne?
755    But who is here? {Lysander} on the ground;
756    Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound,
757    {Lysander}, if you liue, good sir awake.
758    <S {Lys}.> And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
759    Transparent {Helena}, nature her shewes #art,
760    That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart.
761    Where is {Demetrius}? oh how fit a word
762    Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!
763    <S {Hel}.> Do not say so {Lysander}, say not so:
764   *What though he   loue your {Hermia}? Lord, what though?
765    Yet {Hermia} still loues you; then be content.
766    <S {Lys}.> Content with {Hermia}? no, I do repent
767    The tedious minutes I with her haue spent.
768    Not {Hermia}, but {Helena} now I loue;
769    Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue?
770    The #will of man is by his reason sway'd:
771    And reason saies you are the worthier Maide.
772    Things growing are not ripe vntill their season;
773    So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason,
774    And touching now the point of humane skill,
775    Reason becomes the Marshall to my #will.
776    And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke
777    Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke.
778   *<S {Hel}.> Wherefore   was I to this keene mockery borne?
779    When at your hands did I deserue this scorne?
780    Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man,
781    That I did neuer, no nor neuer can,
782    Deserue a sweete looke from {Demetrius} eye,
783    But you must flout my insufficiency?
784    Good troth you do me wrong (good- sooth you do)
785    In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe.
786    But fare you well; perforce I must confesse,
787    I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse.
788    Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd,
789    Should of another therefore be abus'd.  <D {Exit}.>
790    <S {Lys}.> She sees not {Hermia}: {Hermia} sleepe thou there,
791    And neuer maist thou come {Lysander} neere;
792    For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
793    The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings:
794    Or as the heresies that men do leaue,
795    Are hated most of those that did deceiue:
796    So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie,
797    Of all be hated; but the most of me;
798    And all my powers addresse your loue and #might,
799    To honour {Helen}, and to be her Knight.  <D {Exit}.>
800    <S {Her}.> Helpe me {Lysander}, helpe me; do thy best
801    To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest.
802    Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here?
803    {Lysander} looke, how I do quake with feare:
804    Me- thought a serpent eate my heart away,
805    And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey.
806    {Lysander}, What remoou'd? {Lysander}, Lord,
807    What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?
808    Alacke where are you? speake #and if you heare:
809    Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare.
810    No, then I well perceiue you are not nye,
811    Either death or you Ile finde immediately.  <D {Exit}.>
812    <Z {Actus Tertius}.>
813    <D {Enter the Clownes}.>
814    <S {Bot}.> Are we all met?
815   *<S {Quin}.> Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient
816   *place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our
817   *stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will
818    do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.
819    <S {Bot}.> {Peter Quince}?
820    <S {Peter}.> What saist thou, bully {Bottome}?
821   *<S {Bot}.> There are things in this Comedy of {Piramus} and
822   *{Thisby}, that will neuer please. First, {Piramus} must draw a
823   *sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.
824    How answere you that?
825    <S {Snout}.> Berlaken, a parlous feare.
826   *<S {Star}.> I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when
827    all is done.
828   *<S {Bot}.> Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.
829   *Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,
830   *we will do no harme with our swords, and that {Pyramus}
831   *is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,
832   *tell them, that I {Piramus} am not {Piramus}, but {Bottome} the
833    Weauer; this will put them out of feare.
834   *<S {Quin}.> Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall
835    be written in eight and sixe.
836   *<S {Bot}.> No, make it two more, let it be written in eight
837    and eight.
838    <S {Snout}.> Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?
839    <S {Star}.> I feare it, I promise you.
840   *<S {Bot}.> Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to
841   *bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most
842   *dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde
843   *foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke
844    to it.
845   *<S {Snout}.> Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not
846    a Lyon.
847   *<S {Bot}.> Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face
848   *must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe
849   *must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;
850   *Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
      <P N4v>
851   *request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to
852   *tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither
853   *as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such
854   *thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let
855   *him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is {Snug} the
856    ioyner.
857   *<S {Quin}.> Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard
858   *things, that is, to bring the Moone- light into a cham-ber:
859   *for you know {Piramus} and {Thisby} meete by Moone-light.
860   _
861   *<S {Sn}.> Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our
862    play?
863   *<S {Bot}.> A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,
864    finde out Moone- shine, finde out Moone- shine.
865    <D {Enter Pucke}.>
866    <S {Quin}.> Yes, it doth shine that night.
867   *<S {Bot}.> Why then may you leaue a casement of the great
868   *chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone
869    may shine in at the casement.
870   *<S {Quin}.> #I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
871   *and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to pre-sent
872   *the person of Moone- shine. Then there is another
873   *thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for {Pi-ramus}
874   *and {Thisby} (saies the story) did talke through the
875    chinke of a wall.
876   *<S {Sn}.> You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you
877    {#Bottome}?
878   *<S {Bot}.> Some man or other must present wall, and let
879   *him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough
880   *cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fin-gers
881   *thus; and through that cranny shall {Piramus} and
882    {Thisby} whisper.
883   *<S {Quin}.> If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
884   *downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.
885   *{Piramus}, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,
886   *enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his
887    cue.
888    <D {Enter Robin}.>
889   *<S {Rob}.> What hempen home- spuns haue we swagge-ring
890    here,
891    So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene?
892    What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor,
893    An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
894    <S {Quin}.> Speake {Piramus}: {Thisby} stand forth.
895    <S {Pir}.> {Thisby}, the flowers of odious sauors sweete.
896    <S {Quin}.> Odours, odours.
897    <S {Pir}.> Odours sauors sweete,
898    So hath thy breath, my dearest {Thisby} deare.
899    But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here #a while,
900    And #by and by I will to thee appeare.  <D {Exit. Pir}.>
901    <S {Puck}.> A stranger {Piramus}, then ere plaid here.
902    <S {This}.> Must I speake now?
903   *<S {Pet}.> #I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he
904   *goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come a-gaine.
905   _
906   *<S {Thys}.> Most radiant {Piramus}, most Lilly white of hue,
907    Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer,
908    Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew,
909    As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre,
910    Ile meete thee {Piramus}, at {Ninnies} toombe.
911   *<S {Pet}.> {Ninus} toombe man: why, you must not speake
912   *that yet; that you answere to {Piramus}: you speake all
913   *your part at once, cues and all. {Piramus} enter, your cue is
914    past; it is neuer tyre.
915   *<S {Thys}.> O, as true as truest horse, that yet would neuer
916    tyre:
917    <S {Pir}.> If I were faire, {Thisby} I were onely thine.
918   *<S {Pet}.> O monstrous. O strange. We are hanted; pray
919    masters, flye masters, helpe.
920    <D {The Clownes all Exit}.>
921    <S {Puk}.> Ile follow you, Ile leade you about a Round,
922   *Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through |(bryer,
923    Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound:
924    A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire,
925    And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne,
926   *Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne.  <D {Exit}.>
927    <D {Enter Piramus with the Asse head}.>
928   *<S {Bot}.> Why do they run away? This is a knauery of
929    them to make me afeard.  <D {Enter Snowt}.>
930   *<S {Sn}.> O {Bottom}, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on
931    thee?
932   *<S {Bot}.> What do you see? You see an Asse- head of your
933    owne, do you?
934    <D {Enter Peter Quince}.>
935   *<S {Pet}.> Blesse thee {Bottome}, blesse thee; thou art transla-ted.
936    <D {Exit}.>
937   *<S {Bot}.> I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me,
938   *to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from
939   *this place, do what they can. I will walke vp and downe
940   *here, and I will sing that they shall heare I am not a-fraid.
941   _
942    The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew,
943    With Orenge- tawny bill.
944    The Throstle, with his note so true,
945    The Wren and little quill.
946    <S {Tyta}.> What Angell wakes me from my flowry bed?
947    <S {Bot}.> The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Larke,
948    The plainsong Cuckow gray;
949    Whose note full many a man doth marke,
950    And dares not answere, nay.
951   *For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
952   *Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow,
953    neuer so?
954    <S {Tyta}.> I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe,
955    Mine eare is much enamored of thy note;
956    On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee.
957    So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.
958    And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me.
959   *<S {Bot}.> Me- thinkes mistresse, you should haue little
960   *reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and
961   *loue keepe little company together, now-adayes.
962   *The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will
963   *not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occa-sion.
964   _
965    <S {Tyta}.> Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull.
966   *<S {Bot}.> Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get
967   *out of this wood, I haue enough to serue mine owne
968    turne.
969    <S {Tyta}.> Out of this wood, do not desire to goe,
970    Thou shalt remaine here, whether thou wilt or no.
971    I am a spirit of no common rate:
972    The Summer still doth tend vpon my state,
973    And I doe loue thee; therefore goe with me,
974    Ile giue thee Fairies to attend on thee;
975    And they shall fetch thee Iewels from the deepe,
976    And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepe:
977    And I will purge thy mortall grossenesse so,
978    That thou shalt like an airie spirit go.
979    <D {Enter Pease- blossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustard-seede},
980    {and foure Fairies}.>
981   *<S {Fai}.> Ready; and I, and I, and I, Where shall we go?
      <P N5>
982    <S {Tita}.> Be kinde and curteous to this Gentleman,
983    Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies,
984    Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries,
985    With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries,
986    The honie- bags steale from the humble Bees,
987    And for night- tapers crop their waxen thighes,
988    And light them at the fierie- Glow- wormes eyes,
989    To haue my loue to bed, and to arise:
990    And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies,
991    To fan the Moone- beames from his sleeping eies.
992    Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies.
993    <S 1.{Fai}.> Haile mortall, haile.
994    <S 2.{Fai}.> Haile.
995    <S 3.{Fai}.> Haile.
996   *<S {Bot}.> I cry your worships mercy hartily; I beseech
997    your worships name.
998    <S {Cob}.> {Cobweb}.
999   *<S {Bot}.> I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good
1000  *Master {Cobweb}: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold
1001   with you.
1002   Your name honest Gentleman?
1003   <S {Pease}.> {Pease Blossome}.
1004  *<S {Bot}.> I pray you commend me to mistresse {Squash},
1005  *your mother, and to master {Peascod} your father. Good
1006  *master {Pease- blossome}, I shal desire of you more acquain-tance
1007   #to. Your name I beseech you sir?
1008   <S {Mus}.> {Mustard- seede}.
1009   <S {Peas}.> {Pease- blossome}.
1010  *<S {Bot}.> Good master {Mustard} {seede}, I know your pati-ence
1011  *well: that same cowardly gyant- like Oxe beefe
1012  *hath deuoured many a gentleman of your house. I pro-mise
1013  *you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere
1014  *now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master
1015   {Mustard- seede}.
1016  *<S {Tita}.> Come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower.
1017   The Moone me- thinks, lookes with a watrie eie,
1018   And when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower,
1019   Lamenting some enforced chastitie.
1020   Tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently.  <D {Exit}.>
1021   <D {Enter King of Pharies, solus}.>
1022   <S {Ob}.> I wonder if {Titania} be awak't;
1023   Then what it was that next came in her eye,
1024   Which she must dote on, in extremitie.
1025   <D {Enter Pucke}.>
1026   Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,
1027   What night- rule now about this haunted groue?
1028   <S {Puck}.> My Mistris with a monster is in loue,
1029   Neere to her close and consecrated bower,
1030   While she was in her dull and sleeping hower,
1031   A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,
1032   That worke for bread vpon {Athenian} stals,
1033   Were met together to rehearse a Play,
1034   Intended for great {Theseus} nuptiall day:
1035   The shallowest thick- skin of that barren sort,
1036   Who {Piramus} presented, in their sport,
1037   Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake,
1038   When I did him at this aduantage take,
1039   An Asses nole I fixed on his head.
1040   Anon his {Thisbie} must be answered,
1041   And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,
1042   As Wilde- geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,
1043   Or russed- pated choughes, many in sort
1044   (Rising and cawing at the guns report)
1045   Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye:
1046   So at his sight, away his fellowes flye,
1047   And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals;
1048   He murther cries, and helpe from {Athens} cals.
1049  *Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong,
1050   Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong.
1051   For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch,
1052   Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch,
1053   I led them on in this distracted feare,
1054   And left sweete {Piramus} translated there:
1055   When in that moment (so it came to passe)
1056   {Tytania} waked, and straightway   lou'd an Asse.
1057   <S {Ob}.> This fals out better then I could deuise:
1058   But hast thou yet lacht the {Athenians} eyes,
1059   With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?
1060   <S {Rob}.> I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht #to)
1061   And the {Athenian} woman by his side,
1062   That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde.
1063   <D {Enter Demetrius and Hermia}.>
1064   <S {Ob}.> Stand close, this is the same {Athenian}.
1065   <S {Rob}.> This is the woman, but not this the man.
1066   <S {Dem}.> O why rebuke you him that loues you so?
1067   Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
1068   <S {Her}.> Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse.
1069   For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse,
1070   If thou hast slaine {Lysander} in his sleepe,
1071  *Being oreshooes   in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill
1072   me too:
1073   The Sunne was not so true vnto the day,
1074   As he to me. Would he haue stollen away,
1075   From sleeping {Hermia}? Ile beleeue as soone
1076   This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone
1077   May through the Center creepe, and so displease
1078   Her brothers noonetide,   with th'{#Antipodes}.
1079   It cannot be but thou hast murdred him,
1080   So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim.
1081  *<S {Dem}.> So should the murderer looke, and so should I,
1082   Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty:
1083   Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare,
1084   As yonder {Venus} in her glimmering spheare.
1085   <S {Her}.> What's this to my {Lysander}? where is he?
1086   Ah good {Demetrius}, wilt thou giue him me?
1087   <S {Dem}.> I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds.
1088  *<S {Her}.> Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds
1089   Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then?
1090   Henceforth be neuer numbred among men.
1091   Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake,
1092   Durst thou #a lookt vpon him, being awake?
1093   And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch:
1094   Could not a worme, an Adder do so much?
1095   An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue
1096   Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung.
1097   <S {Dem}.> You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood,
1098   I am not guiltie of {Lysanders} blood:
1099   Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell.
1100   <S {Her}.> I pray thee tell me then that he is well.
1101   <S {Dem}.> #And if I could, what should I get therefore?
1102   <S {Her}.> A priuiledge, neuer to see me more;
1103   And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more
1104   Whether he be dead or no.  <D {Exit}.>
1105   <S {Dem}.> There is no following her in this fierce vaine,
1106   Here therefore for #a while I will remaine.
1107   So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow:
1108   For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe,
1109   Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
      <P N5v><C C>
1110   If for his tender here I make some stay.  <D {Lie downe}.>
1111  *<S {Ob}.> What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite
1112   And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight:
1113   Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue
1114   Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
1115  *<S {Rob}.> Then fate ore- rules, that one man holding troth,
1116   A million faile, confounding oath on oath.
1117   <S {Ob}.> About the wood, goe swifter then the winde,
1118   And {Helena} of {Athens} looke thou finde.
1119   All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere,
1120   With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare.
1121   By some illusion see thou bring her heere,
1122   Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare.
1123   <S {Robin}.> I go, I go, looke how I goe,
1124   Swifter then arrow from the {Tartars} bowe.  <D {Exit}.>
1125   <S {Ob}.> Flower of this purple die,
1126   Hit with {Cupids} archery,
1127   Sinke in apple of his eye,
1128   When his loue he doth espie,
1129   Let her shine as gloriously
1130   As the {Venus} of the sky.
1131   When thou wak'st if she be by,
1132   Beg of her for remedy.
1133   <D {Enter Pucke}.>
1134   <S {Puck}.> Captaine of our Fairy band,
1135   {Helena} is heere at hand,
1136   And the youth, mistooke by me,
1137   Pleading for a Louers fee.
1138   Shall we their fond Pageant see?
1139   Lord, what fooles these mortals be!
1140   <S {Ob}.> Stand aside: the noyse they make,
1141   Will cause {Demetrius} to awake.
1142   <S {Puck}.> Then will two at once wooe one,
1143   That must needs be sport alone:
1144   And those things doe best please me,
1145   That befall preposterously.
1146   <D {Enter Lysander and Helena}.>
1147  *<S {Lys}.> Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn?
1148   Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares:
1149   Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne,
1150   In their natiuity all truth appeares.
1151   How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you?
1152   Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true.
1153  *<S {Hel}.> You doe aduance your cunning more & more,
1154   When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray!
1155   These vowes are {Hermias}. Will you giue her ore?
1156   Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.
1157   Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales)
1158   Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales.
1159   <S {Lys}.> I had no iudgement, when to her I swore.
1160   <S {Hel}.> Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore.
1161  *<S {Lys}.> {Demetrius} loues her, and he loues not you.  <D {Awa}.>
1162   <S {Dem}.> O {Helen}, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine,
1163   To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne!
1164   Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show,
1165   Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
1166   That pure congealed white, high {Taurus} snow,
1167   Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow,
1168   When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse
1169   This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse.
1170   <S {Hell}.> O spight! O #hell! I see you are all bent
1171   To set against me, for your merriment:
1172   If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie,
1173   You would not doe me thus much iniury.
1174   Can you not hate me, as I know you doe,
1175   But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me #to?
1176   If you are men, as men you are in show,
1177   You would not vse a gentle Lady so;
1178   To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts,
1179   When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
1180   You both are Riuals, and loue {Hermia};
1181   And now both Riuals to mocke {Helena}.
1182   A trim exploit, a manly enterprize,
1183   To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes,
1184   With your derision; none of noble sort,
1185   Would so offend a Virgin, and extort
1186   A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,
1187   <S {Lysa}.> You are vnkind {Demetrius}; be not so,
1188   For you loue {Hermia}; this you know I know;
1189   And here with all good #will, with all my heart,
1190   In {Hermias} loue I yeeld you vp my part;
1191   And yours of {Helena}, To me bequeath,
1192   Whom I do loue, and will do to my death.
1193   <S {Hel}.> Neuer did mockers #wast more idle breth.
1194   <S {Dem}.> {Lysander}, keep thy {Hermia}, I will none:
1195   If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone.
1196   My heart to her, but as guest- wise soiourn'd,
1197   And now to {Helen} it is home return'd,
1198   There to remaine.
1199   <S {Lys}.> It is not so.
1200   <S {De}.> Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
1201   Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.
1202   Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.
1203   <D {Enter Hermia}.>
1204  *<S {Her}.> Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
1205   The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,
1206   Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,
1207   It paies the hearing double recompence.
1208   Thou art not by mine eye, {Lysander} found,
1209   Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.
1210   But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?
1211  *<S {Lysan}.> Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse |(to go?
1212  *<S {Her}.> What loue could presse {Lysander} from my side?
1213   <S {Lys}.> {Lysanders} loue (that would not let him bide)
1214   Faire {Helena}; who more engilds the night,
1215   Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.
1216  *Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,
1217   The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?
1218   <S {Her}.> You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be.
1219   <S {Hel}.> Loe, she is one of this confederacy,
1220   Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,
1221   To fashion this false sport in spight of me.
1222   Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,
1223   Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd
1224   To baite me, with this foule derision?
1225   Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,
1226   The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,
1227   When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,
1228   For parting vs; O, is all forgot?
1229   All schooledaies friendship, child- hood innocence?
1230   We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,
1231   Haue with our needles, created both one flower,
1232   Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
1233   Both warbling of one song, both in one key:
1234   As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes
1235   Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,
1236   Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
1237   But yet a vnion in partition,
      <P N6><C D>
1238   Two louely berries molded on one stem,
1239   So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
1240   Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,
1241   Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
1242   And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,
1243   To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?
1244   It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.
1245   Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,
1246   Though I alone doe feele the iniurie.
1247   <S {Her}.> I am amazed at your passionate words,
1248   I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me.
1249   <S {Hel}.> Haue you not set {Lysander}, as in scorne
1250   To follow me, and praise my eies and face?
1251   And made your other loue, {Demetrius}
1252   (Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)
1253   To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,
1254   Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this
1255   To her he hates? and wherefore doth {Lysander}
1256   Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)
1257   And tender me (forsooth) affection,
1258   But by your setting on, by your consent?
1259   What though I be not so in grace as you,
1260   So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?
1261   (But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)
1262   This you should pittie, rather then despise.
1263   <S {Her}.> I vnderstand not what you meane by this.
1264   <S {Hel}.> #I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes,
1265   Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe,
1266   Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp:
1267   This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.
1268   If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners,
1269   You would not make me such an argument:
1270   But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault,
1271   Which death or absence soone shall remedie.
1272   <S {Lys}.> Stay gentle {Helena}, heare my excuse,
1273   My loue, my life, my soule, faire {Helena}.
1274   <S {Hel}.> O excellent!
1275   <S {Her}.> Sweete, do not scorne her so.
1276   <S {Dem}.> If she cannot entreate, I can compell.
1277  *<S {Lys}.> Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate.
1278  *Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise.
1279   {#Helen}, I loue thee, by my life I doe;
1280   I sweare by that which I will lose for thee,
1281   To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not.
1282   <S {Dem}.> I say, I loue thee more then he can do.
1283   <S {Lys}.> If thou say so, with-draw and proue it too.
1284   <S {Dem}.> Quick, come.
1285   <S {Her}.> {Lysander}, whereto tends all this?
1286   <S {Lys}.> Away, you {Ethiope}.
1287   <S {Dem}.> No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose;
1288   Take on as you would follow,
1289   But yet come not: you are a tame man, go.
1290  *<S {Lys}.> Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,
1291   Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
1292   <S {Her}.> Why are you growne so rude?
1293   What change is this sweete Loue?
1294   <S {Lys}.> Thy loue? out tawny {Tartar}, out;
1295   Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence.
1296   <S {Her}.> Do you not iest?
1297   <S {Hel}.> Yes sooth, and so do you.
1298   <S {Lys}.> {Demetrius}: I will keepe my word with thee.
1299   <S {Dem}.> I would I had your bond: for I perceiue
1300   A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word.
1301  *<S {Lys}.> What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
1302   Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so.
1303  *<S {Her}.> What, can you do me greater harme then hate?
1304   Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue?
1305   Am not I {Hermia}? Are not you {Lysander}?
1306   I am as faire now, as I was ere while.
1307   Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me.
1308   Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)
1309   In earnest, shall I say?
1310   <S {Lys}.> #I, by my life;
1311   And neuer did desire to see thee more.
1312   Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
1313   Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest,
1314   That I do hate thee, and loue {Helena}.
1315   <S {Her}.> O me, you iugler, you canker blossome,
1316   You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night,
1317   And stolne my loues heart from him?
1318   <S {Hel}.> Fine yfaith:
1319   Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame,
1320   No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare
1321   Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
1322   Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you.
1323   <S {Her}.> Puppet? why so? #I, that way goes the game.
1324   Now I perceiue that she hath made compare
1325   Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height,
1326   And with her personage, her tall personage,
1327   Her height (forsooth)   she hath preuail'd with him.
1328   And are you growne so high in his esteeme,
1329   Because I am so dwarfish, and so low?
1330   How low am I, thou painted May- pole? Speake,
1331   How low am I? I am not yet so low,
1332   But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes.
1333   <S {Hel}.> I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen,
1334   Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:
1335   I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse;
1336   I am a right maide for my cowardize;
1337   Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke,
1338   Because she is something lower then my selfe,
1339   That I can match her.
1340   <S {Her}.> Lower? harke againe.
1341   <S {Hel}.> Good {Hermia}, do not be so bitter with me,
1342   I euermore did loue you {Hermia},
1343   Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you,
1344   Saue that in loue vnto {Demetrius},
1345   I told him of your stealth vnto this wood.
1346   He followed you, for loue I followed him,
1347   But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me
1348   To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too;
1349   And now, so you will let me quiet go,
1350   To {Athens} will I beare my folly backe,
1351   And follow you no further. Let me go.
1352   You see how simple, and how fond I am.
1353  *<S {Her}.> Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?
1354   <S {Hel}.> A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde.
1355   <S {Her}.> What, with {Lysander}?
1356   <S {Her}.> With {Demetrius}.
1357   <S {Lys}.> Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee {Helena}.
1358  *<S {Dem}.> No sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
1359   <S {Hel}.> O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd,
1360   She was a vixen when she went to schoole,
1361   And though she be but little, she is fierce.
1362   <S {Her}.> Little againe? Nothing but low and little?
1363   Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
1364   Let me come to her.
1365   <S {Lys}.> Get you gone you dwarfe,
1366   You {minimus}, of hindring knot- grasse made,
1367   You bead, you acorne.
1368   <S {Dem}.> You are too officious,
1369   In her behalfe that scornes your seruices.
      <P N6v>
1370   Let her alone, speake not of {Helena},
1371   Take not her part. For if thou dost intend
1372   Neuer so little shew of loue to her,
1373   Thou shalt abide it.
1374   <S {Lys}.> Now she holds me not,
1375   Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
1376   Of thine or mine is most in {Helena}.
1377  *<S {Dem}.> Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by
1378   iowle.  <D {Exit Lysander and Demetrius}.>
1379   <S {Her}.> You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you.
1380   Nay, goe not backe.
1381   <S {Hel}.> I will not trust you I,
1382   Nor longer stay in your curst companie.
1383   Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,
1384   My legs are longer though to runne away.
1385   <D {Enter Oberon and Pucke}.>
1386   <S {Ob}.> This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,
1387   Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly.
1388   <S {Puck}.> Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke,
1389   Did not you tell me, I should know the man,
1390   By the {Athenian} garments he hath on?
1391   And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize,
1392   That I haue nointed   an Athenians eies,
1393   And so farre am I glad, it so did sort,
1394   As this their iangling I esteeme a sport.
1395   <S {Ob}.> Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight,
1396   Hie therefore {Robin}, ouercast the night,
1397   The starrie Welkin couer thou anon,
1398   With drooping fogge as blacke as {Acheron},
1399   And lead these testie Riuals so astray,
1400   As one come not within anothers way.
1401   Like to {Lysander}, sometime frame thy tongue,
1402   Then stirre {Demetrius} vp with bitter wrong;
1403   And sometime raile thou like {Demetrius};
1404   And from each other looke thou leade them thus,
1405   Till ore their browes, death- counterfeiting, sleepe
1406   With leaden legs, and Battie- wings doth creepe:
1407   Then crush this hearbe into {Lysanders} eie,
1408   Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie,
1409   To take from thence all error, with his #might,
1410   and make his eie- bals role with wonted sight.
1411   When they next wake, all this derision
1412   Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision,
1413   And backe to {Athens} shall the Louers wend
1414   With league, whose date till death shall neuer end.
1415   Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy,
1416   Ile to my Queene, and beg her {Indian} Boy;
1417   And then I will her charmed eie release
1418   From monsters view, and all things shall be peace.
1419   <S {Puck}.> My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste,
1420   For night- swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast,
1421   And yonder shines {Auroras} harbinger;
1422   At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there,
1423   Troope home to Church- yards; damned spirits all,
1424   That in crosse- waies and flouds haue buriall,
1425   Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone;
1426   For feare least day should looke their shames vpon,
1427   They wilfully themselues exile from light,
1428   And must for aye consort with blacke browd night.
1429   <S {Ob}.> But we are spirits of another sort:
1430   I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport,
1431   And like a Forrester, the groues may tread,
1432   Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red,
1433   Opening on {Neptune}, With faire blessed beames,
1434   Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames.
1435   But not withstanding haste, make no delay:
1436   We may effect this businesse, yet ere day.
1437  *<S {Puck}.> Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade
1438  *them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne.
1439   {Goblin}, lead them vp and downe: here comes one.
1440   <D {Enter Lysander}.>
1441   <S {Lys}.> Where art thou, proud {Demetrius}?
1442   Speake thou now.
1443  *<S {Rob}.> Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou?
1444   <S {Lys}.> I will be with thee straight.
1445   <S {Rob}.> Follow me then to plainer ground.
1446   <D {Enter Demetrius}.>
1447   <S {Dem}.> {Lysander}, speake againe;
1448   Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
1449   Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?
1450   <S {Rob}.> Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
1451   Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
1452   And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe,
1453   Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
1454   That drawes a sword on thee.
1455   <S {Dem}.> Yea, art thou there?
1456  *<S {Ro}.> Follow my voice, #we'l try no manhood here.  <D {Exit}.>
1457   <S {Lys}.> He goes before me, and still dares me on,
1458   When I come where he cals, then he's gone.
1459   The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I:
1460   I followed fast, but faster he did flye;  <D {shifting places}.>
1461   That fallen am I in darke vneuen way,
1462   And here wil rest me. Come thou gentle day:  <D {lye down}.>
1463   For if but once thou shew me thy gray light,
1464   Ile finde {Demetrius}, and reuenge this spight.
1465   <D {Enter Robin and Demetrius}.>
1466   <S {Rob}.> Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not?
1467   <S {Dem}.> Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot,
1468   Thou runst before me, shifting euery place,
1469   And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face.
1470   Where art thou?
1471   <S {Rob}.> Come hither, I am here.
1472  *<S {Dem}.> Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this
1473   deere,
1474   If euer I thy face by day- light see.
1475   Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me,
1476   To measure out my length on this cold bed,
1477   By daies approach looke to be visited.
1478   <D {Enter Helena}.>
1479   <S {Hel}.> O weary night, O long and tedious night,
1480   Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East,
1481   That I may backe to {Athens} by day- light,
1482   From these that my poore companie detest;
1483   And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie,
1484   Steale me #a while from mine owne companie.  <D {Sleepe}.>
1485   <S {Rob}.> Yet but three? Come one more,
1486   Two of both kindes makes vp foure.
1487   Here she comes, curst and sad,
1488   {Cupid} is a knauish lad,
1489   <D {Enter Hermia}.>
1490   Thus to make poore females mad.
1491   <S {Her}.> Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe,
1492   Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars,
1493   I can no further crawle, no further goe;
1494   My legs can keepe no pace with my desires.
1495   Here will I rest me till the breake of day,
1496   Heauens shield {Lysander}, if they meane a fray.
1497   <S {Rob}.> On the ground sleepe sound,
1498   Ile apply your eie gentle louer, remedy.
1499   When thou wak'st, thou tak'st
1500   True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye,
      <P O1><C C>
1501   And the Country Prouerb knowne,
1502   That euery man should take his owne,
1503   In your waking shall be showne.
1504   {Iacke} shall haue {Iill}, nought shall goe #ill.
1505  *The man shall haue his Mare againe, and all shall bee
1506   well.
1507   <D {They sleepe all the Act}.>
1508   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1509  *<D {Enter Queene of Fairies, and Clowne, and Fairies, and the}
1510   {King behinde them}.>
1511   <S {Tita}.> Come, sit thee downe vpon this flowry bed,
1512   While I thy amiable cheekes doe coy,
1513   And sticke muske roses in thy sleeke smoothe head,
1514   And kisse thy faire large eares, my gentle ioy.
1515   <S {Clow}.> Where's {Peaseblossome}?
1516   <S {Peas}.> Ready.
1517  *<S {Clow}.> Scratch my head, {Pease- blossome}. Wher's Moun-sieuer
1518   {Cobweb}.
1519   <S {Cob}.> Ready.
1520  *<S {Clowne}.> Mounsieur {Cobweb}, good Mounsier get your
1521  *weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble- Bee,
1522  *on the top of a thistle;   and good Mounsieur bring mee
1523  *the hony bag. Doe not fret your selfe too much in the
1524  *action, Mounsieur; and good mounsieur haue a care the
1525  *hony bag breake not, I would be loth to haue you ouer-flowne
1526  *with a hony- bag signiour. Where's Mounsieur
1527   {Mustardseed}?
1528   <S {Mus}.> Ready.
1529   <S {Clo}.> Giue me your neafe, Mounsieur {Mustardseed}.
1530   Pray you leaue your courtesie good Mounsieur.
1531   <S {Mus}.> What's your #will?
1532  *<S {Clo}.> Nothing good Mounsieur, but to help Caualery
1533  *{Cobweb} to scratch. I must to the Barbers Mounsieur, for
1534  *me- thinkes   I am maruellous hairy about the face. And I
1535  *am such a tender asse, if my haire do but tickle me, I must
1536   scratch.
1537  *<S {Tita}.> What, wilt thou heare some musicke, my sweet
1538   loue.
1539  *<S {Clow}.> I haue a reasonable good eare in musicke. Let
1540   vs haue the tongs and the bones.
1541   <D {Musicke Tongs, Rurall Musicke}.>
1542  *<S {Tita}.> Or say sweete Loue, what thou desirest to eat.
1543  *<S {Clowne}.> Truly a pecke of Prouender;   I could munch
1544  *your good dry Oates. Me- thinkes I haue a great desire
1545  *to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweete hay hath no fel-low.
1546  _
1547   <S {Tita}.> I haue a venturous Fairy,
1548   That shall seeke the Squirrels hoard,
1549   And fetch thee new Nuts.
1550  *<S {Clown}.> I had rather haue a handfull or two of dried
1551  *pease. But I pray you let none of your people stirre me, I
1552   haue an exposition of sleepe come vpon me.
1553  *<S {Tyta}.> Sleepe thou, and I will winde thee in my arms,
1554   Fairies be gone, and be alwaies away.
1555   So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honisuckle,
1556   Gently entwist; the female Iuy so
1557   Enrings the barky fingers of the Elme.
1558   O how I loue thee! how I dote on thee!
1559   <D {Enter Robin goodfellow and Oberon}.>
1560   <S {Ob}.> Welcome good {Robin}:
1561   Seest thou this sweet sight?
1562   Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty.
1563   For meeting her of late behinde the wood,
1564   Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole,
1565   I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her.
1566   For she his hairy temples then had rounded,
1567   With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.
1568   And that same dew which somtime on the buds,
1569   Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles;
1570   Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes,
1571   Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile.
1572   When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
1573   And she in milde termes beg'd my patience,
1574   I then did aske of her, her changeling childe,
1575   Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent
1576   To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land.
1577   And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe
1578   This hatefull imperfection of her eyes.
1579   And gentle {Pucke}, take this transformed scalpe,
1580   From off the head of this {Athenian} swaine;
1581   That he awaking when the other doe,
1582   May all to {Athens} backe againe repaire,
1583   And thinke no more of this nights accidents,
1584   But as the fierce vexation of dreame.
1585   But first I will release the Fairy Queene.
1586   {Be thou as thou wast wont to be;}
1587   {See as thou wast wont to see}.
1588   {Dians bud, or Cupids flower},
1589   {Hath such force and blessed power}.
1590   Now my {Titania} wake you my sweet Queene.
1591   <S {Tita}.> My {Oberon}, what visions haue I seene!
1592   Me- thought I was enamoured of an asse.
1593   <S {Ob}.> There lies your loue.
1594   <S {Tita}.> How came these things to passe?
1595   Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!
1596   <S {Ob}.> Silence #a while. {Robin} take off his head:
1597   {Titania}, musick call, and strike more dead
1598   Then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense.
1599   <S {Tita}.> Musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe.
1600   <D {Musick still}.>
1601  *<S {Rob}.> When thou wak'st, with thine owne fooles eies
1602   peepe.
1603  *<S {Ob}.> Sound musick; come my Queen, take hands with |(me
1604   And rocke the ground whereon these sleepers be.
1605   Now thou and I new in amity,
1606   And will to morrow midnight, solemnly
1607   Dance in Duke {Theseus} house triumphantly,
1608   And blesse it to all faire posterity.
1609   There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be
1610   Wedded, with {Theseus}, all in iollity.
1611   <S {Rob}.> Faire King attend, and marke,
1612   I doe heare the morning Larke,
1613   <S {Ob}.> Then my Queene in silence sad,
1614   Trip we after the nights shade;
1615   We the Globe can compasse soone,
1616   Swifter then the wandering Moone.
1617   <S {Tita}.> Come my Lord, and in our flight,
1618   Tell me how it came this night,
1619   That I sleeping heere was found,
1620   <D {Sleepers Lye still}.>
      <P O1v>
1621   With these mortals on the ground.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1622   <D {Winde Hornes}.>
1623   <D {Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine}.>
1624   <S {Thes}.> Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester,
1625   For now our obseruation is perform'd;
1626   And since we haue the vaward of the day,
1627   My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds.
1628   Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe;
1629   Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester.
1630   We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top,
1631   And marke the musicall confusion
1632   Of hounds and eccho in coniunction.
1633   <S {Hip}.> I was with {Hercules} and {Cadmus} once.
1634   When in a wood of {Creete} they bayed the Beare
1635   With hounds of {Sparta}; neuer did I heare
1636   Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues,
1637   The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere,
1638   Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard
1639   So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder.
1640   <S {Thes}.> My hounds are bred out of the {Spartan} kinde,
1641   So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
1642   With eares that sweepe away the morning dew,
1643   Crooke kneed, and dew- lapt, like {Thessalian} Buls,
1644   Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels,
1645   Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable
1646   Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd   with horne,
1647   In {Creete}, in {Sparta}, nor in {Thessaly};
1648  *Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?
1649   <S {Egeus}.> My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe,
1650   And this {Lysander}, this {Demetrius} is,
1651   This {Helena}, olde {Nedars Helena},
1652   I wonder of this being heere together.
1653   <S {The}.> No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue
1654   The right of #May; and hearing our intent,
1655   Came heere in grace of our solemnity.
1656   But speake {Egeus}, is not this the day
1657   That {Hermia} should giue answer of her choice?
1658   <S {Egeus}.> It is, my Lord.
1659  *<S {Thes}.> Goe bid the hunts- men wake them with their
1660   hornes.
1661   <D {Hornes and they wake}.>
1662   <D {Shout within, they all start vp}.>
1663  *<S {Thes}.> Good morrow friends:   Saint {Valentine} is past,
1664   Begin these wood birds but to couple now?
1665   <S {Lys}.> Pardon my Lord.
1666   <S {Thes}.> I pray you all stand vp.
1667   I know you two are Riuall enemies.
1668   How comes this gentle concord in the world,
1669   That hatred   is so farre from iealousie,
1670   To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity.
1671   <S {Lys}.> My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,
1672   Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare,
1673   I cannot truly say how I came heere.
1674   But as I thinke (for truly would I speake)
1675   And now I doe bethinke me, so it is;
1676   I came with {Hermia} hither. Our intent
1677   Was to be gone from {Athens}, where we might be
1678   Without the perill of the {Athenian} Law.
1679  *<S {Ege}.> Enough, enough, my Lord:   you haue enough;
1680   I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head:
1681   They would have stolne away, they would {Demetrius},
1682   Thereby   to haue defeated you and me:
1683   You of your wife, and me of my consent;
1684   Of my consent, that she should be your wife.
1685   <S {Dem}.> My Lord, faire {Helen} told me of their stealth,
1686   Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,
1687   And I in furie hither followed them;
1688   Faire {Helena}, in fancy followed me.
1689   But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power,
1690   (But by some power it is)   my loue
1691   To {Hermia} (melted as the snow)
1692  *Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,
1693   Which in my childehood I did doat vpon:
1694   And all the faith, the vertue of my heart,
1695   The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye,
1696   Is onely {Helena}. To her, my Lord,
1697   Was I betroth'd, ere I see {Hermia},
1698   But like a sickenesse did I loath this food,
1699   But as in health, come   to my naturall taste,
1700   Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it,
1701   And will for euermore be true to it.
1702   <S {Thes}.> Faire Louers, you are fortunately met;
1703   Of this discourse we shall heare more anon.
1704   {#Egeus}, I will ouer- beare your #will;
1705   For in the Temple, #by and by with vs,
1706   These couples shall eternally be knit.
1707   And for the morning now is something worne,
1708   Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
1709   Away, with vs to {Athens}; three and three,
1710   Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.
1711   Come {Hippolita}.  <D {Exit Duke and Lords}.>
1712  *<S {Dem}.> These things seeme small & vndistinguishable,
1713   Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds.
1714   <S {Her}.> Me- thinks I see these things with parted eye,
1715   When euery thing seemes double.
1716   <S {Hel}.> So me- thinkes:
1717   And I haue found {Demetrius}, like a iewell,
1718   Mine owne, and not mine owne.
1719   <S {Dem}.> It seemes to mee,
1720   That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke,
1721   The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?
1722   <S {Her}.> Yea, and my Father.
1723   <S {Hel}.> And {Hippolita}.
1724   <S {Lys}.> And he bid vs follow to the Temple.
1725  *<S {Dem}.> Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and
1726   by the way let vs recount our dreames.
1727   <D {Bottome wakes}.>  <D {Exit Louers}.>
1728  *<S {Clo}.> When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
1729  *My next is, most faire {Piramus}. Hey ho. {Peter Quince}?
1730  *{Flute} the bellowes- mender? {Snout} the tinker? {Starue-ling}?
1731  *Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I
1732  *haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit
1733  *of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,
1734  *if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me- thought I
1735  *was, there is no man can tell what. Me- thought I was,
1736  *and me- thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,
1737  *if he will offer to say, what me- thought I had. The eye of
1738  *man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans
1739  *hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his
1740  *heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get {Peter}
1741  *{#Quince} to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called
1742  *{Bottomes Dreame}, because it hath no bottome; and I will
1743  *sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Per-aduenture,
1744  *to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
1745   at her death. <D {Exit}.>
1746   <D {Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling}.>
1747  *<S {Quin}.> Haue you sent to {Bottomes} house? Is he come
1748   home yet?
1749  *<S {Staru}.> He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is
1750   transported.
      <P O2>
1751  *<S {This}.> If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes
1752   not forward, doth it?
1753  *<S {Quin}.> It is not possible: you haue not a man in all
1754   {Athens}, able to discharge {Piramus} but he.
1755  *<S {This}.> No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handy-craft
1756   man in {Athens}.
1757  *<S {Quin}.> Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very
1758   Paramour, for a sweet voyce.
1759  *<S {This}.> You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God
1760   blesse vs) a thing of nought.
1761   <D {Enter Snug the Ioyner}.>
1762  *<S {Snug}.> Masters, the Duke is comming from the Tem-ple,
1763  *and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more mar-ried.
1764  *If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made
1765   men.
1766  *<S {This}.> O sweet bully {Bottome}: thus hath he lost sixe-pence
1767  *a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped six-pence
1768  *a day. #And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence
1769  *a day for playing {Piramus}, Ile be hang'd. He would haue
1770   deserued it. Sixpence a day in {Piramus}, or nothing.
1771   <D {Enter Bottome}.>
1772  *<S {Bot}.> Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?
1773  *<S {Quin}.> {Bottome}, o most couragious day! O most hap-pie
1774   houre!
1775  *<S {Bot}.> Masters, I am to  discourse wonders; but ask me
1776  *not what. For if I tell you, I am no true {Athenian}. I
1777   will tell you euery thing as it fell out.
1778   <S {Qu}.> Let vs heare, sweet {Bottome}.
1779  *<S {Bot}.> Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that
1780  *the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good
1781  *strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps,
1782  *meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his
1783  *part:   for the short and the long is, our play is preferred:
1784  *In any case let {Thisby} haue cleane linnen: and let not him
1785  *that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for   they shall hang
1786  *out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate
1787  *no Onions, nor Garlicke;   for wee are to vtter sweete
1788  *breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a
1789   sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away.
1790   <D {Exeunt}.>
1791   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
1792   <D {Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus and his Lords}.>
1793  *<S {Hip}.> 'Tis strange my {Theseus}, y these louers speake of.
1794   <S {The}.> More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue
1795   These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes,
1796   Louers and mad men haue such seething braines,
1797   Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more
1798   Then coole reason euer comprehends.
1799   The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet,
1800   Are of imagination all compact.
1801   One sees more diuels then vaste #hell can hold;
1802   That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke,
1803   Sees {Helens} beauty in a brow of {Egipt}.
1804   The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance
1805   From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen.
1806   And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things
1807   Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes,
1808   And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation,
1809   And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination,
1810   That if it would but apprehend some ioy,
1811   It comprehends some bringer of that ioy.
1812   Or in the night, imagining some feare,
1813   Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare?
1814   <S {Hip}.> But all the storie of the night told ouer,
1815   And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
1816   More witnesseth than fancies images,
1817   And growes to something of great constancie;
1818   But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable.
1819   <D {Enter louers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia},
1820   {and Helena}.>
1821   <S {The}.> Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth:
1822   Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes
1823   Of loue accompany your hearts.
1824   <S {Lys}.> More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes,
1825   your boord, your bed.
1826  *<S {The}.> Come now, what maskes, what dances shall
1827   we haue,
1828   To weare away this long age of three houres,
1829   Between our after supper, and bed- time?
1830   Where is our vsuall manager of mirth?
1831   What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play,
1832   To ease the anguish of a torturing houre?
1833   Call {Egeus}.
1834   <S {Ege}.> Heere mighty {Theseus}.
1835  *<S {The}.> Say, what abridgement haue you for this eue-ning?
1836  _
1837   What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile
1838   The lazie time, if not with some delight?
1839   <S {Ege}.> There is a breefe how many sports are rife:
1840   Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first.
1841   <S {Lis}.> The battell with the Centaurs to be sung
1842   By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe.
1843  *<S {The}.> Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue
1844   In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
1845   <S {Lis}.> The riot of the tipsie Bachanals,
1846   Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?
1847   <S {The}.> That is an old deuice, and it was plaid
1848   When I from {Thebes} came last a Conqueror.
1849   <S {Lis}.> The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death
1850   of learning, late deceast in beggerie.
1851   <S {The}.> That is some Satire keene and criticall,
1852   Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie.
1853   <S {Lis}.> A tedious breefe Scene of yong {Piramus},
1854   And his loue {Thisby}; very tragicall mirth.
1855  *<S {The}.> Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That
1856  *is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee
1857   finde the concord of this discord?
1858  *<S {Ege}.> A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,
1859   Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play;
1860   But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;
1861   Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,
1862   There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.
1863   And tragicall my noble Lord it is:   for {Piramus}
1864   Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw
1865   Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water:
1866   But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter
1867   Neuer shed.
1868   <S {Thes}.> What are they that do play it?
1869  *<S {Ege}.> Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere,
1870   Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now;
1871   And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories
1872   With this same play, against your nuptiall.
1873   <S {The}.> And we will heare it.
      <P O2v>
1874  *<S {Hip}.> No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard
1875   It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;
1876   Vnless you can finde sport in their intents,
1877   Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine,
1878   To doe you seruice.
1879   <S {Thes}.> I will heare that play. For neuer any thing
1880   Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it.
1881   Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies.
1882   <S {Hip}.> I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged;
1883   And duty in his seruice perishing.
1884   <S {Thes}.> Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
1885   <S {Hip}.> He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde.
1886  *<S {Thes}.> The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing
1887   Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;
1888   And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect
1889   Takes it in #might, not merit.
1890   #Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed
1891   To greete me with premeditated welcomes;
1892   Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale,
1893   Make periods in the midst of sentences,
1894   Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares,
1895   And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off,
1896   Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete,
1897   Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome:
1898   And in the modesty of fearefull duty,
1899   I read as much, as from the ratling tongue
1900   Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
1901   Loue therefore, and tongue- tide simplicity,
1902   In least, speake most, to my capacity.
1903  *<S {Egeus}.> So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest.
1904   <S {Duke}.> Let him approach.  <D {Flor. Trum}.>
1905   <D {Enter the Prologue.  Quince}.>
1906   <S {Pro}.> If we offend, it is with our good #will.
1907   That you should thinke, we come   not to offend,
1908   But with good #will. To shew our simple skill,
1909   That is the true beginning of our end.
1910   Consider then, we come but in despight.
1911   We do not come, as minding to content you,
1912   Our true intent is. All for your delight,
1913   We are not heere. That you should here repent you,
1914   The Actors are at hand; and by their show,
1915   You shall know all, that you are like to know.
1916   <S {Thes}.> This fellow doth not stand vpon points.
1917  *<S {Lys}.> He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he
1918  *knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not
1919   enough to speake, but to speake true.
1920  *<S {Hip}.> Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a
1921   childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment.
1922  *<S {Thes}.> His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing
1923   impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
1924   <D {Tawyer with a Trumpet before them}.>
1925   <D {Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone- shine, and Lyon}.>
1926   <S {Prol}.> Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,
1927   But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine.
1928   This man is {Piramus}, if you would know;
1929   This beauteous Lady, {Thisby} is certaine.
1930   This man, with lyme and rough- cast, doth present
1931   Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder:
1932  *And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content
1933   To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.
1934   This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne,
1935   Presenteth moone- shine. For if you will know,
1936   By moone- shine did these Louers thinke no scorne
1937   To meet at {Ninus} toombe, there, there to wooe:
1938   This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)
1939   The trusty {Thisby}, comming first by night,
1940   Did scarre away, or rather did affright:
1941   And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
1942   Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.
1943   Anon comes {Piramus}, sweet youth and tall,
1944   And findes his {Thisbies} Mantle slaine;
1945   Whereat,   with blade, with bloody blamefull   blade,
1946   He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,
1947   And {Thisby}, tarrying in Mulberry shade,
1948   His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
1949   Let {Lyon}, {Moone- shine}, {Wall}, and Louers twaine,
1950   At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.
1951   <D {Exit all but Wall}.>
1952   <S {Thes}.> I wonder if the Lion be to speake.
1953  *<S {Deme}.> No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when
1954   many Asses doe.
1955   <D {Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine}.>
1956   <S {Wall}.> In this same Interlude, it doth befall,
1957   That I, one {Snowt} (by name) present a wall:
1958   And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,
1959   That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:
1960   Through which the Louers, {Piramus} and {Thisbie}
1961   Did whisper often, very secretly.
1962   This loame, this rough- cast, and this stone doth shew,
1963   That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.
1964   And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
1965   Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper.
1966  *<S {Thes}.> Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake
1967   better?
1968  *<S {Deme}.> It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard
1969   discourse, my Lord.
1970   <S {Thes}.> {Pyramus} drawes neere the Wall, silence.
1971   <D {Enter Pyramus}.>
1972   <S {Pir}.> O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,
1973   O night, which euer art, when day is not:
1974   O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,
1975   I feare my {Thisbies} promise is forgot.
1976   And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,
1977   That stands between her fathers ground and mine,
1978   Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,
1979  *Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.
1980   Thankes courteous wall. {Ioue} shield thee well for this.
1981   But what see I? No {Thisbie} doe I see.
1982   O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,
1983   Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee.
1984  *<S {Thes}.> The wall me- thinkes being sensible, should
1985   curse againe.
1986   <S {Pir}.> No in truth sir, he should not. {Deceiuing me},
1987   Is {Thisbies} cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy
1988   Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.
1989   <D {Enter Thisbie}.>
1990   Pat as I told you; yonder she comes.
1991   <S {This}.> O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,
1992   For parting my faire {Piramus}, and me
1993   My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;
1994   Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee.
1995   <S {Pyra}.> I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,
1996   To spy #and I can heare my {Thisbies} face. {Thisbie}?
1997   <S {This}.> My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke.
1998  *<S {Pir}.> Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,
1999   And like {Limander} am I trusty still.
2000   <S {This}.> And like {Helen} till the Fates me kill.
2001   <S {Pir}.> Not {Shafalus} to {Procrus} was so true.
2002   <S {This}.> As {Shafalus} to {Procrus}, I to you.
      <P O3><C B>
2003   <S {Pir}.> O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall.
2004   <S {This}.> I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all.
2005  *<S {Pir}.> Wilt thou at {Ninnies} tombe meete me straight
2006   way?
2007   <S {This}.> Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
2008   <S {Wall}.> Thus haue I {Wall}, my part discharged so;
2009   And being done, thus {Wall} away doth go. <D {Exit Clow}.>
2010   <S {Du}.> Now is the morall downe between the two
2011   Neighbours.
2012  *<S {Dem}.> No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wil-full,
2013   to heare without warning.
2014   <S {Dut}.> This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard.
2015  *<S {Du}.> The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the
2016   worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.
2017  *<S {Dut}.> It must be your imagination then, & not theirs.
2018  *<S {Duk}.> If wee imagine no worse of them then they of
2019  *themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com
2020   two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.
2021   <D {Enter Lyon and Moone- shine}.>
2022  *<S {Lyon}.> You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare
2023   The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)
2024   May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,
2025   When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.
2026   Then know that I, one {Snug} the Ioyner am
2027   A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:
2028   For if I should as Lion come in strife
2029   Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life.
2030   <S {Du}.> A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience.
2031  *<S {Dem}.> The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw.
2032   <S {Lis}.> This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor.
2033   <S {Du}.> True, and a Goose for his discretion.
2034  *<S {Dem}.> Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie
2035   his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose.
2036  *<S {Du}.> His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:
2037  *for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to
2038   his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone.
2039  *<S {Moone}.> This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone pre-sent.
2040  _
2041   <S {De}.> He should haue worne the hornes on his head.
2042  *<S {Du}.> Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,
2043   within the circumference.
2044  *<S {Moon}.> This lanthorne doth the horned Moone pre-sent:
2045   My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be.
2046  *<S {Du}.> This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man
2047  *Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man
2048   i'th Moone?
2049   <S {Dem}.> He dares not come there for the candle.
2050   For you see, it is already in snuffe.
2051  *<S {Dut}.> I am wearie of this Moone; would he would
2052   change.
2053  *<S {Du}.> It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that
2054  *he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we
2055   must stay the time.
2056   <S {Lys}.> Proceed Moone.
2057  *<S {Moon}.> All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the
2058  *Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this
2059   thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog.
2060  *<S {Dem}.> Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for
2061  *they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes {Thisby}.
2062   <D {Enter Thisby}.>
2063  *<S {This}.> This is old {Ninnies} tombe: where is my loue?
2064   <S {Lyon}.> Oh.
2065   <D {The Lion roares, Thisby runs off}.>
2066   <S {Dem}.> Well roar'd Lion.
2067   <S {Du}.> Well run {Thisby}.
2068   <S {Dut}.> Well shone Moone.
2069   Truly the Moone shines with a good grace.
2070   <S {Du}.> Wel mouz'd Lion.
2071   <S {Dem}.> And then came {Piramus}.
2072   <S {Lys}.> And so the Lion vanisht.
2073   <D {Enter Piramus}.>
2074  *<S {Pyr}.> Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,
2075   I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:
2076   For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,
2077   I trust to taste of truest {Thisbies} sight.
2078   But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,
2079   What dreadful dole is heere?
2080   Eyes do you see! How can it be!
2081   O dainty Ducke: O Deere!
2082   Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!
2083   Approch you furies fell:
2084   O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,
2085   Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell.
2086   <S {Du}.> This passion, and the death of a deare friend,
2087   Would go neere to make a man looke sad.
2088   <S {Dut}.> Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man.
2089   <S {Pir}.> O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?
2090   Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:
2091   Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame
2092  *That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.
2093   Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound
2094   The pap of {Piramus}:
2095   #I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;
2096   Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.
2097   Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,
2098   Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,
2099   Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye.
2100  *<S {Dem}.> No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one.
2101  *<S {Lis}.> Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is no-thing.
2102  _
2103  *<S {Du}.> With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet reco-uer,
2104   and proue an Asse.
2105   <S {Dut}.> How chance Moone- shine is gone before?
2106   {#Thisby} comes backe, and findes her Louer.
2107   <D {Enter Thisby}.>
2108   <S {Duke}.> She wil finde him by starre- light.
2109   Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play.
2110  *<S {Dut}.> Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for
2111   such a {Piramus}: I hope she will be breefe.
2112  *<S {Dem}.> A Moth wil turne the ballance, which {Piramus}
2113   which {Thisby} is the better.
2114  *<S {Lys}.> She hath spyed him already, with those sweete |(eyes.
2115   <S {Dem}.> And thus she meanes, {videlicit}.
2116   <S {This}.> Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?
2117   O {Piramus} arise:
2118   Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe
2119   Must couer thy sweet eyes.
2120   These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,
2121   These yellow Cowslip cheekes
2122   Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:
2123   His eyes were greene as Leekes.
2124   O Sisters three, come, come to mee,
2125   With hands as pale as Milke,
2126   Lay them in gore, since you haue shore
2127   with sheeres, his thred of silke.
2128   Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:
2129   Come blade, my brest imbrue:
      <P O3v><C C>
2130   And farwell friends, thus {Thisbie} ends;
2131   Adieu, adieu, adieu.
2132   <S {Duk}.> Moone- shine & Lion are left to burie the dead.
2133   <S {Deme}.> #I, and Wall too.
2134  *<S {Bot}.> No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted
2135  *their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
2136  *to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our com-pany?
2137  _
2138  *<S {Duk}.> No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
2139  *no excuse. Neuer excuse;   for when the plaiers are all
2140  *dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that
2141  *writ it had plaid {Piramus}, and hung himselfe in {Thisbies}
2142  *garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is
2143  *truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your
2144   Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.
2145   The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.
2146   Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
2147   I feare we shall out- sleepe the comming morne,
2148   As much as we this night haue ouer- watcht.
2149   This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd
2150   The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.
2151   A fortnight hold we this solemnity.
2152   In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2153   <D {Enter Pucke}.>
2154   <S {Puck}.> Now the hungry Lyons rores,
2155   And the Wolfe beholds the Moone:
2156   Whilest the heauy ploughman snores,
2157   All with weary taske fore- done.
2158   Now the wasted brands doe glow,
2159   Whil'st the scritch- owle, scritching loud,
2160   Puts the wretch that lies in woe,
2161   In remembrance of a shrowd.
2162   Now it is the time of night,
2163   That the graues, all gaping wide,
2164   Euery one lets forth his spright,
2165   In the Church- way paths to glide,
2166   And we Fairies, that do runne,
2167   By the triple {Hecates} teame,
2168   From the presence of the Sunne,
2169   Following darkenesse like a dreame,
2170   Now are frollicke; not a Mouse
2171   Shall disturbe this hallowed house.
2172   I am sent with broome before,
2173   To sweep the dust behinde the doore.
2174   <D {Enter King and Queene of Fairies, with their traine}.>
2175   <S {Ob}.> Through the house giue glimmering light,
2176   By the dead and drowsie fier,
2177   Euerie Elfe and Fairie spright,
2178   Hop as light as bird from brier,
2179   And this Ditty after me, sing and dance it trippinglie,
2180   <S {Tita}.> First rehearse this song by roate,
2181   To each word a warbling note.
2182   Hand in hand, with Fairie grace,
2183   Will we sing and blesse this place.
2184   <D {The Song}.>
2185   {Now vntill the breake of day},
2186   {Through this house each Fairy stray}.
2187   {To the best Bride- bed will we},
2188   {Which by vs shall blessed be:}
2189   {And the issue there create},
2190   {Euer shall be fortunate:}
2191   {So shall all the couples three},
2192   {Euer true in louing be:}
2193   {And the blots of Natures hand},
2194   {Shall not in their issue stand}.
2195   {Neuer mole, harelip, nor scarre},
2196   {nor mark prodigious, such as are}
2197   {Despised in Natiuitie},
2198   {Shall vpon their children be}.
2199   {With this field dew consecrate},
2200   {Euery Fairy take his gate},
2201   {And each seuerall   chamber blesse},
2202   {Through this Pallace with sweet peace},
2203   {Euer shall in safety rest}.
2204   {And the owner of it blest}.
2205   {Trip away, make no stay;}
2206   {Meet me all by breake of day}.
2207   <S {Robin}.> If we shadowes haue offended,
2208   Thinke but this (and all is mended)
2209   That you haue but slumbred heere,
2210   While these Visions did appeare.
2211   And this weake and idle theame,
2212   No more yeelding but a dreame,
2213   Gentles, doe not reprehend.
2214   If you pardon, we will mend.
2215   And as I am an honest {Pucke},
2216   If we haue vnearned lucke,
2217   Now to scape the Serpents tongue,
2218   We will make amends ere long:
2219   Else the {Pucke} a lyar call.
2220   So good night vnto you all.
2221   Giue me your hands, if we be friends,
2222   And {Robin} shall restore amends.
