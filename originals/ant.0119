4      Nay, but this dotage of our Generals
5     *Ore- flowes the measure: those his goodly eyes
6      That o're the Files and Musters of the Warre,
7      Haue glow'd like plated Mars:
8      Now bend, now turne
9      The Office and Deuotion of their view
10     Vpon a Tawny Front. His Captaines heart,
11     Which in the scuffles of great Fights hath burst
12     The Buckles on his brest, reneages all temper,
13     And is become the Bellowes and the Fan
14     To coole a Gypsies Lust.
15     <D {Flourish. Enter Anthony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the}
16     {Traine, with Eunuchs fanning her}.>
17     Looke where they come:
18     Take but good note, and you shall see in him
19     (The triple Pillar of the world) transform'd
20     Into a Strumpets Foole. Behold and see.
21     <S {Cleo}.> If it be Loue indeed, tell me how much.
22    *<S {Ant}.> There's beggery in the loue that can be reckon'd
23     <S {Cleo}.> Ile set a bourne how farre to be belou'd.
24    *<S {Ant}.> Then must thou needes finde out new Heauen,
25     new Earth.
26     <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
27     <S {Mes}.> Newes (my good Lord) from Rome.
28     <S {Ant}.> Grates me, the summe.
29     <S {Cleo}.> Nay heare them {Anthony}.
30     {Fuluia} perchance is angry: Or who knowes,
31     If the scarse- bearded {Caesar} haue not sent
32     His powrefull Mandate to you. Do this, or this;
33     Take in that Kingdome, and Infranchise that:
34     Perform't, or else we damne thee.
35     <S {Ant}.> How, my Loue?
36     <S {Cleo}.> Perchance? Nay, and most like:
37     You must not stay heere longer, your dismission
38     Is come from {Caesar}, therefore heare it {Anthony},
39     Where's {Fuluias} Processe? ({Caesars} I would say) both?
40     Call in the Messengers: As I am Egypts Queene,
41     Thou blushest {Anthony}, and that blood of thine
42     Is {Caesars} homager: else so thy cheeke payes shame,
43     When shrill- tongu'd {Fuluia} scolds. The Messengers.
44     <S {Ant}.> Let Rome in Tyber melt, and the wide Arch
45     Of the raing'd Empire fall: Heere is my space,
46     Kingdomes are clay: Our dungie earth alike
47     Feeds Beast as Man; the Noblenesse of life
48     Is to do thus: when such a mutuall paire,
49     And such a twaine can doo't, in which I binde
50     #One paine of punishment, the world to weete
51     We stand vp Peerelesse.
52     <S {Cleo}.> Excellent falshood:
53     Why did he marry {Fuluia}, and not loue her?
54    *Ile seeme the Foole I am not. {Anthony} will be himselfe.
55     <S {Ant}.> But stirr'd by {Cleopatra}.
56     Now for the loue of Loue, and her soft houres,
57     Let's not confound the time with Conference harsh;
58     There's not a minute of our liues should stretch
59     Without some pleasure now. What sport to night?
60     <S {Cleo}.> Heare the Ambassadors.
61     <S {Ant}.> Fye wrangling Queene:
62     Whom euery thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
63     To weepe: who euery passion fully striues
64     To make it selfe (in Thee) faire, and admir'd.
65     No Messenger but thine, and all alone, to night
66     Wee'l wander through the streets, and note
67     The qualities of people. Come my Queene,
68     Last night you did desire it. Speake not to vs.
69     <D {Exeunt with the Traine}.>
70     <S {Dem}.> Is {Caesar} with {Anthonius} priz'd so slight?
71     <S {Philo}.> Sir, sometimes when he is not {Anthony},
72     He comes too short of that great Property
73     Which still should go with {Anthony}.
74    *<S {Dem}.> I am full sorry, that hee approues the common
75    *Lyar, who thus speakes of him at Rome; but I will hope
76     of better deeds to morrow. Rest you happy.  <D {Exeunt}>

82    *that you prais'd so to'th' Queene? Oh that I knewe this
83    *Husband, which you say, must change his Hornes with
84     Garlands.
85     <S {Alex}.> Soothsayer.
86     <S {Sooth}.> Your #will?
87    *<S {Char}.> Is this the Man? Is't you sir that know things?
88    *<S {Sooth}.> In Natures infinite booke of Secrecie, a little I
89     can read.
90     <S {Alex}.> Shew him your hand.

93     <S {Char}.> Good sir, giue me good Fortune.
94     <S {Sooth}.> I make not, but foresee.
95     <S {Char}.> Pray then, foresee me one.

101    <S {Char}.> Hush.
102    <S {Sooth}.> You shall be more belouing, then beloued.

105   *<S {Char}.> Good now some excellent Fortune: Let mee
106   *be married to three Kings in a forenoone, and Widdow
107   *them all: Let me haue a Childe at fifty, to whom {Herode}
108   *of Iewry may do Homage. Finde me to marrie me with
109    {Octauius Caesar}, and companion me with my Mistris.
110   *<S {Sooth}.> You shall out- liue the Lady whom you serue.
111   *<S {Char}.> Oh excellent, I loue long life better then Figs.
112   *<S {Sooth}.> You haue seene and proued a fairer former for-tune,
113    then that which is to approach.
114   *<S {Char}.> Then belike my Children shall haue no names:

121    <S {Char}.> Nay come, tell {Iras} hers.
122    <S {Alex}.> Wee'l know all our Fortunes.
123   *<S {Enob}.> Mine, and most of our Fortunes to night, shall
124    be drunke to bed.
125   *<S {Iras}.> There's a Palme presages Chastity, if nothing els.

134    <S {Sooth}.> I haue said.
135    <S {Iras}.> Am I not an inch of Fortune better then she?
136   *<S {Char}.> Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better
137    then I: where would you choose it.
138    <S {Iras}.> Not in my Husbands nose.
139    <S {Char}.> Our worser thoughts Heauens mend.

142   *and let her dye too, and giue him a worse, and let worse
143   *follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to

145   *Prayer, though thou denie me a matter of more waight:
146    good {Isis} I beseech thee.
147   *<S {Iras}.> Amen, deere Goddesse, heare that prayer of the
148   *people. For, as it is a heart- breaking to see a handsome
149   *man loose- Wiu'd, so it is a deadly sorrow, to beholde a
150   *foule Knaue vncuckolded: Therefore deere {Isis} keep {de-corum},
151    and Fortune him accordingly.
152    <S {Char}.> Amen.
153   *<S {Alex}.> Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make mee a
154   *Cuckold, they would make themselues Whores, but
155    they'ld doo't.
156    <D {Enter Cleopatra}.>

158    <S {Char}.> Not he, the Queene.
159    <S {Cleo}.> Saue you, my Lord.
160    <S {Enob}.> No Lady.
161    <S {Cleo}.> Was he not heere?
162    <S {Char}.> No Madam.
163   *<S {Cleo}.> He was dispos'd to mirth, but on the sodaine
164    A Romane thought hath strooke him.

171    <S {Cleo}.> We will not looke vpon him:
172    Go with vs. <D {Exeunt}.>
173    <S {Messen}.> {Fuluia} thy Wife,
174    First came into the Field.
175    <S {Ant}.> Against my Brother {Lucius}?
176    <S {Messen}.> #I: but soone that Warre had end,
177    And the times state
178   *Made friends of them, ioynting their force 'gainst {Caesar},
179    Whose better issue in the warre from Italy,
180    Vpon the first encounter draue them.
181    <S {Ant}.> Well, what worst.
182    <S {Mess}.> The Nature of bad newes infects the Teller.
183   *<S {Ant}.> When it concernes the Foole or Coward: On.
184    Things that are past, are done, with me. 'Tis thus,
185    Who tels me true, though in his Tale lye death,
186    I heare him as he flatter'd.
187    <S {Mes}.> {Labienus} (this is stiffe- newes)
188    Hath with his Parthian Force
189    Extended Asia: from Euphrates his conquering
190    Banner shooke, from Syria to Lydia,
191    And to Ionia, whil'st===
192    <S {Ant}.> {Anthony} thou would'st say.
193    <S {Mes}.> Oh my Lord.
194    <S {Ant}.> Speake to me home,
195    Mince not the generall tongue, name
196    {Cleopatra} as she is call'd in Rome:
197    Raile thou in {Fuluia's} phrase, and taunt my faults
198    With such full License, as both Truth and Malice
199    Haue power to vtter. Oh then we bring forth weeds,
200    When our quicke windes lye still, and our illes told vs
201    Is as our earing: fare thee well awhile.
202    <S {Mes}.> At your Noble pleasure.  <D {Exit Messenger}>
203    <D {Enter another Messenger}.>
204    <S {Ant}.> From {Scicion} how the newes? Speake there.
205    <S 1.{Mes}.> The man from {Scicion},
206    Is there such an one?
207    <S 2.{Mes}.> He stayes vpon your #will.
208    <S {Ant}.> Let him appeare:
209    These strong Egyptian Fetters I must breake,
210    Or loose my selfe in dotage.
211    <D {Enter another Messenger with a Letter}.>
212    What are you?
213    <S 3.{Mes}.> {Fuluia} thy wife is dead.
214    <S {Ant}.> Where dyed she.
215    <S {Mes}.> In {Scicion}, her length of sicknesse,
216    With what else more serious,
217    Importeth thee to know, this beares.
218    <S {Antho}.> Forbeare me
219    There's a great Spirit gone, thus did I desire it:
220    What our contempts doth often hurle from vs,
      <P xx1v>
221    We wish it ours againe. The present pleasure,
222    By reuolution lowring, does become
223    The opposite of it selfe: she's good being gon,
224    The hand could plucke her backe, that shou'd her on.
225    I must from this enchanting Queene breake off,
226    Ten thousand harmes, more then the illes I know
227    My idlenesse doth hatch.
228    <D {Enter Enobarbus}.>
229    How now {Enobarbus}.
230    <S {Eno}.> What's your pleasure, Sir?
231    <S {Anth}.> I must with haste from hence.
232   *<S {Eno}.> Why then we kill all our Women. We see how
233   *mortall an vnkindnesse is to them, if they suffer our de-parture
234    death's the word.
235    <S {Ant}.> I must be gone.
236   *<S {Eno}.> Vnder a compelling an occasion, let women die.
237   *It were pitty to cast them away for nothing, though be-tweene
238   *them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
239   *nothing. {Cleopatra} catching but the least noyse of this,
240   *dies instantly: I haue seene her dye twenty times vppon
241   *farre poorer moment: I do think there is mettle in death,
242   *which commits some louing acte vpon her, she hath such
243    a celerity in dying.
244    <S {Ant}.> She is cunning past mans thought.
245   *<S {Eno}.> Alacke Sir no, her passions are made of nothing
246   *but the finest part of pure Loue. We cannot cal her winds
247   *and waters, sighes and teares: They are greater stormes
248   *and Tempests then Almanackes can report. This cannot
249   *be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a showre of Raine
250    as well as Ioue.
251    <S {Ant}.> Would I had neuer seene her.
252   *<S {Eno}.> Oh sir, you had then left vnseene a wonderfull
253   *peece of worke, which not to haue beene blest withall,
254    would haue discredited your Trauaile.
255    <S {Ant}.> {Fuluia} is dead.
256    <S {Eno}.> Sir.
257    <S {Ant}.> {Fuluia} is dead.
258    <S {Eno}.> {Fuluia}?
259    <S {Ant}.> Dead.
260   *<S {Eno}.> Why sir, giue the Gods a thankefull Sacrifice:
261   *when it pleaseth their Deities to take the wife of a man
262   *from him, it shewes to man the Tailors of the earth: com-forting
263   *therein, that when olde Robes are worne out,
264   *there are members to make new. If there were no more
265   *Women but {Fuluia}, then had you indeede a cut, and the
266   *case to be lamented: This greefe is crown'd with Conso-lation,
267   *your old Smocke brings foorth a new Petticoate,
268   *and indeed the teares liue in an Onion, that should water
269    this sorrow.
270    <S {Ant}.> The businesse she hath broached in the State,
271    Cannot endure my absence.
272   *<S {Eno}.> And the businesse you haue broach'd heere can-not
273   *be without you, especially that of {Cleopatra's}, which
274    wholly depends on your abode.
275    <S {Ant}.> No more light Answeres:
276    Let our Officers
277    Haue notice what we purpose. I shall breake
278    The cause of our Expedience to the Queene,
279    And get her loue to part. For not alone
280    The death of {Fuluia}, with more vrgent touches
281    Do strongly speake to vs: but the Letters too
282    Of many our contriuing Friends in Rome,
283    Petition vs at home. {Sextus Pompeius}
284    Haue giuen the dare to {Caesar}, and commands
285    The Empire of the Sea. Our slippery people,
286    Whose Loue is neuer link'd to the deseruer,
287    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
288    {#Pompey} the great, and all his Dignities
289    Vpon his Sonne, who high in Name and Power,
290    Higher then both in Blood and Life, stands vp
291    For the maine Souldier. Whose quality going on,
292    The sides o'th' world may danger. Much is breeding,
293    Which like the Coursers heire, hath yet but life,
294    And not a Serpents poyson. Say our pleasure,
295    To such whose places vnder vs, require
296    Our quicke remoue from hence.
297    <S {Enob}.> I shall doo't.
298    <D {Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas, and Iras}.>
299    <S {Cleo}.> Where is he?
300    <S {Char}.> I did not see him since.
301    <S {Cleo}.> See where he is,
302    Whose with him, what he does:
303    I did not send you. If you finde him sad,
304    Say I am dauncing: if in Myrth, report
305    That I am sodaine sicke. Quicke, and returne.
306   *<S {Char}.> Madam, me thinkes if you did loue him deerly,
307    You do not hold the method, to enforce
308    The like from him.
309    <S {Cleo}.> What should I do, I do not?
310   *<S {Ch}.> In each thing giue him way, crosse him in nothing.
311   *<S {Cleo}.> Thou teachest like a foole: the way to lose him.
312    <S {Char}.> Tempt him not so too farre. I wish forbeare,
313    In time we hate that which we often feare.
314    <D {Enter Anthony}.>
315    But heere comes {Anthony}.
316    <S {Cleo}.> I am sicke, and sullen.
317    <S {An}.> I am sorry to giue breathing to my purpose.
318    <S {Cleo}.> Helpe me away deere {Charmian}, I shall fall,
319    It cannot be thus long, the sides of Nature
320    Will not sustaine it.
321    <S {Ant}.> Now my deerest Queene.
322    <S {Cleo}.> Pray you stand farther from mee.
323    <S {Ant}.> What's the matter?
324   *<S {Cleo}.> I know by that same eye ther's some good news.
325    What sayes the married woman you may goe?
326    Would she had neuer giuen you leaue to come.
327    Let her not say 'tis  I that keepe you heere,
328    I haue no power vpon you: Hers you are.
329    <S {Ant}.> The Gods best know.
330    <S {Cleo}.> Oh neuer was there Queene
331    So mightily betrayed: yet at the first
332    I saw the Treasons planted.
333    <S {Ant}.> {Cleopatra}.
334   *<S {Cleo}.> Why should I thinke you can be mine, & true,
335    (Though you in swearing shake the Throaned Gods)
336    Who haue beene false to {Fuluia}?
337    Riotous madnesse,
338    To be entangled with those mouth- made vowes,
339    Which breake themselues in swearing.
340    <S {Ant}.> Most sweet Queene.
341    <S {Cleo}.> Nay pray you seeke no colour for your going,
342    But bid farewell, and goe:
343    When you sued staying,
344    Then was the time for words: No going then,
345    Eternity was in our Lippes, and Eyes,
346    Blisse in our browes bent: none our parts so poore,
347    But was a race of Heauen. They are so still,
348    Or thou the greatest Souldier of the world,
349    Art turn'd the greatest Lyar.
350    <S {Ant}.> How now Lady?
      <P xx2>
351   *<S {Cleo}.> I would I had thy inches, thou should'st know
352    There were a heart in Egypt.
353    <S {Ant}.> Heare me Queene:
354    The strong necessity of Time, commands
355    Our Seruices a- while: but my full heart
356    Remaines in vse with you. Our Italy,
357    Shines o're with ciuill Swords; {Sextus Pompeius}
358    Makes his approaches to the Port of Rome,
359    Equality of two Domesticke powers,
360   *Breed scrupulous faction: The hated growne to strength
361    Are newly growne to Loue: The condemn'd {Pompey},
362    Rich in his Fathers Honor, creepes apace
363    Into the hearts of such, as haue not thriued
364    Vpon the present state, whose Numbers threaten,
365    And quietnesse growne sicke of rest, would purge
366    By any desperate change: My more particular,
367    And that which most with you should safe my going,
368    Is {Fuluias} death.
369   *<S {Cleo}.> Though age from folly could not giue me freedom
370    It does from childishnesse. Can {Fuluia} dye?
371    <S {Ant}.> She's dead my Queene.
372    Looke heere, and at thy Soueraigne leysure read
373    The Garboyles she awak'd: at the last, best,
374    See when, and where shee died.
375    <S {Cleo}.> O most false Loue!
376    Where be the Sacred Violles thou should'st fill
377    With sorrowfull water? Now I see, I see,
378    In {Fuluias} death, how mine receiu'd shall be.
379    <S {Ant}.> Quarrell no more, but bee prepar'd to know
380    The purposes I beare: which are, or cease,
381    As you shall giue th' aduice. By the fire
382    That quickens Nylus slime, I go from hence
383    Thy Souldier, Seruant, making Peace or Warre,
384    As thou affects.
385    <S {Cleo}.> Cut my Lace, {Charmian} come,
386    But let it be, I am quickly #ill, and well,
387    So {Anthony} loues.
388    <S {Ant}.> My precious Queene forbeare,
389    And giue true euidence to his Loue, which stands
390    An honourable Triall.
391    <S {Cleo}.> So {Fuluia} told me.
392    I prythee turne aside, and weepe for her,
393    Then bid adiew to me, and say the teares
394    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one Scene
395    Of excellent dissembling, and let it looke
396    Like perfect Honor.
397    <S {Ant}.> You'l heat my blood no more?
398    <S {Cleo}.> You can do better yet: but this is meetly.
399    <S {Ant}.> Now by Sword.
400    <S {Cleo}.> And Target. Still he mends.
401    But this is not the best. Looke prythee {Charmian},
402    How this Herculean Roman do's become
403    The carriage of his chafe.
404    <S {Ant}.> Ile leaue you Lady.
405    <S {Cleo}.> Courteous Lord, one word:
406    Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
407    Sir, you and I haue lou'd, but there's not it:
408    That you know well, something it is I would:
409    Oh, my Obliuion is a very {Anthony},
410    And I am all forgotten.
411    <S {Ant}.> But that your Royalty
412    Holds Idlenesse your subiect, I should take you
413    For Idlenesse it selfe.
414    <S {Cleo}.> 'Tis sweating Labour,
415    To beare such Idlenesse so neere the heart
416    As {Cleopatra} this. But Sir, forgiue me,
417    Since my becommings kill me, when they do not
418    Eye well to you. Your Honor calles you hence,
419    Therefore be deafe to my vnpittied Folly,
420    And all the Gods go with you. Vpon your Sword
421    Sit Lawrell victory, and smooth successe
422    Be strew'd before your feete.
423    <S {Ant}.> Let vs go.
424    Come: Our separation so abides and flies,
425    That thou reciding heere, goes yet with mee;
426    And I hence fleeting, heere remaine with thee.
427    Away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
428    <D {Enter Octauius reading a Letter, Lepidus},
429    {and their Traine}.>
430    <S {Caes}.> You may see {Lepidus}, and henceforth know,
431    It is not {Caesars} Naturall vice, to hate
432    One great Competitor. From Alexandria
433    This is the newes: He fishes, drinkes, and wastes
434    The Lampes of night in reuell: Is not more manlike
435    Then {Cleopatra}: nor the Queene of {Ptolomy}
436    More Womanly then he. Hardly gaue audience
437    Or vouchsafe to thinke he had Partners. You
438    Shall finde there a man, who is th' abstracts of all faults,
439    That all men follow.
440    <S {Lep}.> I must not thinke
441    There are, euils enow to darken all his goodnesse:
442    His faults in him, seeme as the Spots of Heauen,
443    More fierie by nights Blacknesse; Hereditarie,
444    Rather then purchaste: what he cannot change,
445    Then what he chooses.
446    <S {Caes}.> You are too indulgent. Let's graunt it is not
447    Amisse to tumble on the bed of {Ptolomy},
448    To giue a Kingdome for a Mirth, to sit
449    And keepe the turne of Tipling with a Slaue,
450    To reele the streets at noone, and stand the Buffet
451   *With knaues that smels of sweate: Say this becoms him
452    (As his composure must be rare indeed,
453   *Whom these things cannot blemish) yet must {Anthony}
454    No way excuse his foyles, when we do beare
455    So great waight in his lightnesse. If he fill'd
456    His vacancie with his Voluptuousnesse,
457    Full surfets, and the drinesse of his bones,
458    Call on him for't. But to confound such time,
459    That drummes him from his sport, and speakes as lowd
460    As his owne State, and ours, 'tis to be chid:
461    As we rate Boyes, who being mature in knowledge,
462    Pawne their experience to their present pleasure,
463    And so rebell to iudgement.
464    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
465    <S {Lep}.> Heere's more newes.
466   *<S {Mes}.> Thy biddings haue beene done, & euerie houre
467    Most Noble {Caesar}, shalt thou haue report
468    How 'tis abroad. {Pompey} is strong at Sea,
469    And it appeares, he is belou'd of those
470    That only haue feard {Caesar}: to the Ports
471    The discontents repaire, and mens reports
472    Giue him much wrong'd.
473    <S {Caes}.> I should haue knowne no lesse,
474    It hath bin taught vs from the primall state
475    That he which is was wisht, vntill he were:
476    And the ebb'd man,
477    Ne're lou'd, till ne're worth loue,
478    Comes fear'd, by being lack'd. This common bodie,
479    Like to a Vagabond Flagge vpon the Streame,
480    Goes #too, and backe, lacking the varrying tyde
      <P xx2v>
481    To rot it selfe with motion.
482    <S {Mes}.> {Caesar} I bring thee word,
483    {Menacrates} and {Menas} famous Pyrates
484    Makes the Sea serue them, which they eare and wound
485    With keeles of euery kinde. Many hot inrodes
486    They make in Italy, the Borders Maritime
487    Lacke blood to thinke on't, and flush youth reuolt,
488    No Vessell can peepe forth: but 'tis as soone
489    Taken as seene: for {Pompeyes} name strikes more
490    Then could his Warre resisted
491    <S {Caesar}.> {Anthony},
492    Leaue thy lasciuious Vassailes. When thou once
493    Was beaten from {Medena}, where thou slew'st
494    {Hirsius}, and {Pansa} Consuls, at thy #heele
495    Did Famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
496    (Though daintily brought vp) with patience more
497    Then Sauages could suffer. Thou did'st drinke
498    The stale of Horses, and the gilded Puddle
499   *Which Beasts would cough at. Thy pallat the[n] did daine
500    The roughest Berry, on the rudest Hedge.
501    Yea, like the Stagge, when Snow the Pasture sheets,
502    The barkes of Trees thou brows'd. On the Alpes,
503    It is reported thou did'st eate strange flesh,
504    Which some did dye to looke on: And all this
505    (It wounds thine Honor that I speake it now)
506    Was borne so like a Soldiour, that thy cheeke
507    So much as lank'd not.
508    <S {Lep}.> 'Tis pitty of him.
509    <S {Caes}.> Let his shames quickely
510    Driue him to Rome, 'tis time we twaine
511    Did shew our selues i'th' Field, and to that end
512    Assemble me immediate counsell, {Pompey}
513    Thriues in our Idlenesse.
514    <S {Lep}.> To morrow {Caesar},
515    I shall be furnisht to informe you rightly
516    Both what by Sea and Land I can be able
517    To front this present time.
518   *<S {Caes}.> Til which encounter, it is my busines too. Farwell.
519   *<S {Lep}.> Farwell my Lord, what you shal know mean time
520    Of stirres abroad, I shall beseech you Sir
521    To let me be partaker.
522    <S {Caesar}.> Doubt not sir, I knew it for my Bond.  <D {Exeunt}>
523    <D {Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, & Mardian}.>
524    <S {Cleo}.> {Charmian}.
525    <S {Char}.> Madam.
526    <S {Cleo}.> Ha, ha, giue me to drinke {Mandragora}.
527    <S {Char}.> Why Madam?
528   *<S {Cleo}.> That I might sleepe out this great gap of time:
529    My {Anthony} is away.
530    <S {Char}.> You thinke of him too much.
531    <S {Cleo}.> O 'tis Treason.
532    <S {Char}.> Madam, I trust not so.
533    <S {Cleo}.> Thou, Eunuch {Mardian}?
534    <S {Mar}.> What's your Highnesse pleasure?
535    <S {Cleo}.> Not now to heare thee sing. I take no pleasure
536    In ought an Eunuch ha's: Tis well for thee,
537    That being vnseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
538    May not flye forth of Egypt. Hast thou Affections?
539    <S {Mar}.> Yes gracious Madam.
540    <S {Cleo}.> Indeed?
541    <S {Mar}.> Not in deed Madam, for I can do nothing
542    But what in deede is honest to be done:
543    Yet haue I fierce Affections, and thinke
544    What Venus did with Mars.
545    <S {Cleo}.> Oh {Charmion}:
546    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
547    Or does he walke? Or is he on his Horse?
548    Oh happy horse to beare the weight of {Anthony}!
549   *Do brauely Horse, for wot'st thou whom thou moou'st,
550    The demy {Atlas} of this Earth, the Arme
551    And Burganet of men. Hee's speaking now,
552    Or murmuring, where's my Serpent of old Nyle,
553    (For so he cals me:) Now I feede my selfe
554    With most delicious poyson. Thinke on me
555    That am with Phoebus amorous pinches blacke,
556    And wrinkled deepe in time. Broad- fronted {Caesar},
557    When thou was't heere aboue the ground, I was
558    A morsell for a Monarke: and great {Pompey}
559    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow,
560    There would he anchor his Aspect, and dye
561    With looking on his life.
562    <D {Enter Alexas from Caesar}.>
563    <S {Alex}.> Soueraigne of Egypt, haile.
564    <S {Cleo}.> How much vnlike art thou {Marke Anthony}?
565    Yet comming from him, that great Med'cine hath
566    With his Tinct gilded thee.
567    How goes it with my braue {Marke Anthonie}?
568    <S {Alex}.> Last thing he did (deere Queene)
569    He kist the last of many doubled kisses
570    This Orient Pearle. His speech stickes in my heart.
571    <S {Cleo}.> Mine eare must plucke it thence.
572    <S {Alex}.> Good Friend, quoth he:
573    Say the firme Roman to great Egypt sends
574    This treasure of an Oyster: at whose foote
575    To mend the petty present, I will peece
576    Her opulent Throne, with Kingdomes. All the East,
577    (Say thou) shall call her Mistris. So he nodded,
578    And soberly did mount an Arme- gaunt Steede,
579    Who neigh'd so hye, that what I would haue spoke,
580    Was beastly dumbe by him.
581    <S {Cleo}.> What was he sad, or merry?
582   *<S {Alex}.> Like to the time o'th' yeare, between y extremes
583    Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merrie.
584    <S {Cleo}.> Oh well diuided disposition: Note him,
585    Note him good {Charmian}, 'tis the man; but note him.
586    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
587    That make their lookes by his. He was not merrie,
588    Which seem'd to tell them, his remembrance lay
589    In Egypt with his ioy, but betweene both.
590    Oh heauenly mingle! Bee'st thou sad, or merrie,
591    The violence of either thee becomes,
592    So do's it no mans else. Met'st thou my Posts?
593    <S {Alex}.> #I Madam, twenty seuerall Messengers.
594    Why do you send so thicke?
595   *<S {Cleo}.> Who's borne that day, when I forget to send
596   *to {Anthonie}, shall dye a Begger. Inke and paper {Char-mian}.
597   *Welcome my good {Alexas}. Did I {Charmian}, e-uer
598    loue {Caesar} so?
599    <S {Char}.> Oh that braue {Caesar}!
600    <S {Cleo}.> Be choak'd with such another Emphasis,
601    Say the braue {Anthony}.
602    <S {Char}.> The valiant {Caesar}.
603    <S {Cleo}.> By {Isis}, I will giue thee bloody teeth,
604    If thou with {Caesar} Paragon againe:
605    My man of men.
606    <S {Char}.> By your most gracious pardon,
607    I sing but after you.
608    <S {Cleo}.> My Sallad dayes,
609    When I was greene in iudgement, cold in blood,
610    To say, as I saide then. But come, away,
611    Get me Inke and Paper,
      <P xx3>
612   *he shall haue euery day a seuerall greeting, or Ile vnpeo-ple
613    Egypt. <D {Exeunt}>
614    <D {Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, in}
615    {warlike manner}.>
616    <S {Pom}.> If the great Gods be iust, they shall assist
617    The deeds of iustest men.
618   *<S {Mene}.> Know worthy {Pompey}, that what they do de-lay,
619    they not deny.
620   *<S {Pom}.> Whiles we are sutors to their Throne, decayes
621    the thing we sue for.
622    <S {Mene}.> We ignorant of our selues,
623    Begge often our owne harmes, which the wise Powres
624    Deny vs for our good: so finde we profit
625    By loosing of our Prayers.
626    <S {Pom}.> I shall do well:
627    The people loue me, and the Sea is mine;
628    My powers are Cressent, and my Auguring hope
629    Sayes it will come to'th' full. {Marke Anthony}
630    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
631    No warres without doores. {Caesar} gets money where
632    He looses hearts: {Lepidus} flatters both,
633    Of both is flatter'd: but he neither loues,
634    Nor either cares for him.
635    <S {Mene}.> {Caesar} and {Lepidus} are in the field,
636    A mighty strength they carry.
637    <S {Pom}.> Where haue you this? 'Tis false.
638    <S {Mene}.> From {Siluius}, Sir.
639   *<S {Pom}.> He dreames: I know they are in Rome together
640    Looking for {Anthony}: but all the charmes of Loue,
641    Salt {Cleopatra} soften thy wand lip,
642    Let Witchcraft ioyne with Beauty, Lust with both,
643    Tye vp the Libertine in a field of Feasts,
644    Keepe his Braine fuming. Epicurean Cookes,
645    Sharpen with cloylesse sawce his Appetite,
646    That sleepe and feeding may prorogue his Honour,
647    Euen till a Lethied dulnesse===
648    <D {Enter Varrius}.>
649    How now {Varrius}?
650    <S {Var}.> This is most certaine, that I shall deliuer:
651    {Marke Anthony} is euery houre in Rome
652    Expected. Since he went from Egypt, 'tis
653    A space for farther Trauaile.
654    <S {Pom}.> I could haue giuen lesse matter
655    A better eare. {Menas}, I did not thinke
656    This amorous Surfetter would haue donn'd his Helme
657    For such a petty Warre: His Souldiership
658    Is twice the other twaine: But let vs reare
659    The higher our Opinion, that our stirring
660    Can from the lap of Egypts Widdow, plucke
661    The neere Lust- wearied {Anthony}.
662    <S {Mene}.> I cannot hope,
663    {Caesar} and {Anthony} shall well greet together;
664    His Wife that's dead, did trespasses to {Caesar},
665    His Brother wan'd vpon him, although I thinke
666    Not mou'd by {Anthony}.
667    <S {Pom}.> I know not {Menas},
668    How lesser Enmities may giue way to greater,
669    Were't not that we stand vp against them all:
670   *'Twer pregnant they should square between themselues,
671    For they haue entertained cause enough
672    To draw their swords: but how the feare of vs
673    May Ciment their diuisions, and binde vp
674    The petty difference, we yet not know:
675    Bee't as our Gods will haue't; it onely stands
676    Our liues vpon, to vse our strongest hands
677    Come {Menas}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
678    <D {Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus}.>
679    <S {Lep}.> Good {Enobarbus}, 'tis a worthy deed,
680    And shall become you well, to intreat your Captaine
681    To soft and gentle speech.
682    <S {Enob}.> I shall intreat him
683    To answer like himselfe: if {Caesar} moue him,
684    Let {Anthony} looke ouer {Caesars} head,
685    And speake as lowd as Mars. By Iupiter,
686    Were I the wearer of {Anthonio's} Beard,
687    I would not shaue't to day.
688    <S {Lep}.> 'Tis not a time for priuate stomacking.
689    <S {Eno}.> Euery time serues for the matter that is then
690    borne in't.
691    <S {Lep}.> But small to greater matters must giue way.
692    <S {Eno}.> Not if the small come first.
693    <S {Lep}.> Your speech is passion: but pray you stirre
694    No Embers vp. Heere comes the Noble {Anthony}.
695    <D {Enter Anthony and Ventidius}.>
696    <S {Eno}.> And yonder {Caesar}.
697    <D {Enter Caesar, Mecenas, and Agrippa}.>
698    <S {Ant}.> If we compose well heere, to Parthia:
699    Hearke {Ventidius}.
700    <S {Caesar}.> I do not know {Mecenas}, aske {Agrippa}.
701    <S {Lep}.> Noble Friends:
702    That which combin'd vs was most great, and let not
703    A leaner action rend vs. What's amisse,
704    May it be gently heard. When we debate
705    Our triuiall difference loud, we do commit
706    Murther in healing wounds. Then Noble Partners,
707    The rather for I earnestly beseech,
708    Touch you the sowrest points with sweetest tearmes,
709    Nor curstnesse grow to'th' matter.
710    <S {Ant}.> 'Tis spoken well:
711    Were we before our Armies, and to fight,
712    I should do thus.  <D {Flourish}.>
713    <S {Caes}.> Welcome to Rome.
714    <S {Ant}.> Thanke you.
715    <S {Caes}.> Sit.
716    <S {Ant}.> Sit sir.
717    <S {Caes}.> Nay then.
718    <S {Ant}.> I learne, you take things #ill, which are not so:
719    Or being, concerne you not.
720   *<S {Caes}.> I must be laught at, if or for nothing, or a little, I
721    Should say my selfe offended, and with you
722    Chiefely i'th' world. More laught at, that I should
723    Once name you derogately: when to sound your name
724    It not concern'd me.
725    <S {Ant}.> My being in Egypt {Caesar}, what #was't to you?
726    <S {Caes}.> No more then my reciding heere at Rome
727    Might be to you in Egypt: yet if you there
728    Did practise on my State, your being in Egypt
729    Might be my question.
730    <S {Ant}.> How intend you, practis'd?
731    <S {Caes}.> You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent,
732    By what did heere befall me. Your Wife and Brother
733    Made warres vpon me, and their contestation
734    Was Theame for you, you were the word of warre.
735   *<S {Ant}.> You do mistake your busines, my Brother neuer
736    Did vrge me in his Act: I did inquire it.
737    And haue my Learning from some true reports
738    That drew their swords with you, did he not rather
739    Discredit my authority with yours,
740    And make the warres alike against my stomacke,
741    Hauing alike your cause. Of this, my Letters
742    Before did satisfie you. If you'l patch a quarrell,
743    As matter whole you haue to make it with,
      <P xx3v><C E>
744    It must not be with this.
745   *<S {Caes}.> You praise your selfe, by laying defects of iudge-ment
746    to me: but you patcht vp your excuses.
747    <S {Anth}.> Not so, not so:
748    I know you could not lacke, I am certaine on't,
749    Very necessity of this thought, that I
750    Your Partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
751    Could not with gracefull eyes attend those Warres
752    Which fronted mine owne peace. As for my wife,
753    I would you had her spirit, in such another,
754    The third oth' world is yours, which with a Snaffle,
755    You may pace easie, but not such a wife.
756   *<S {Enobar}.> Would we had all such wiues, that the men
757    might go to Warres with the women.
758    <S {Anth}.> So much vncurbable, her Garboiles ({Caesar})
759    Made out of her impatience: which not wanted
760    Shrodenesse of policie #to: I greeuing grant,
761    Did you too much disquiet, for that you must,
762    But say I could not helpe it.
763   *<S {Caesar}.> I wrote to you, when rioting in Alexandria you
764    Did pocket vp my Letters: and with taunts
765    Did gibe my Misiue out of audience.
766    <S {Ant}.> Sir, he fell vpon me, ere admitted, then:
767    Three Kings I had newly feasted, and did want
768    Of what I was i'th' morning: but next day
769    I told him of my selfe, which was as much
770    As to haue askt him pardon. Let this Fellow
771    Be nothing of our strife: if we contend
772    Out of our question wipe him.
773   *<S {Caesar}.> You haue broken the Article of your oath,
774    which you shall neuer haue tongue to charge me with.
775    <S {Lep}.> Soft {Caesar}.
776    <S {Ant}.> No {Lepidus}, let him speake,
777    The Honour is Sacred which he talks on now,
778    Supposing that I lackt it: but on {Caesar},
779    The Article of my oath.
780   *<S {Caesar}.> To lend me Armes, and aide when I requir'd
781    them, the which you both denied.
782    <S {Anth}.> Neglected rather:
783    And then when poysoned houres had bound me vp
784    From mine owne knowledge, as neerely as I may,
785    Ile play the penitent to you. But mine honesty,
786    Shall not make poore my greatnesse, nor my power
787    Worke without it. Truth is, that {Fuluia},
788    To haue me out of Egypt, made Warres heere,
789    For which my selfe, the ignorant motiue, do
790    So farre aske pardon, as befits mine Honour
791    To stoope in such a case.
792    <S {Lep}.> 'Tis Noble spoken.
793    <S {Mece}.> If it might please you, to enforce no further
794    The griefes betweene ye: to forget them quite,
795    Were to remember: that the present neede,
796    Speakes to attone you.
797    <S {Lep}.> Worthily spoken {Mecenas}.
798   *<S {Enobar}.> Or if you borrow one anothers Loue for the
799   *instant, you may when you heare no more words of
800   *{#Pompey} returne it againe: you shall haue time to wrangle
801    in, when you haue nothing else to do.
802    <S {Anth}.> Thou art a Souldier, onely speake no more.
803   *<S {Enob}.> That trueth should be silent, I had almost for-got.
804   _
805   *<S {Anth}.> You wrong this presence, therefore speake no
806    more.
807    <S {Enob}.> Go #too then: your Considerate stone.
808    <S {Caesar}.> I do not much dislike the matter, but
809    The manner of his speech: for't cannot be,
810    We shall remaine in friendship, our conditions
811    So diffring in their acts. Yet if I knew,
812   *What Hoope should hold vs staunch from edge to edge
813    Ath' world: I would persue it.
814    <S {Agri}.> Giue me leaue {Caesar}.
815    <S {Caesar}.> Speake {Agrippa}.
816   *<S {Agri}.> Thou hast a Sister by the Mothers side, admir'd
817    {Octauia}: Great {Mark Anthony} is now a widdower.
818   *<S {Caesar}.> Say not, say {Agrippa}; if {Cleopater} heard you, your
819    proofe were well deserued of rashnesse.
820   *<S {Anth}.> I am not marryed {Caesar}: let me #heere {Agrippa}
821    further speake.
822    <S {Agri}.> To hold you in perpetuall amitie,
823    To make you Brothers, and to knit your hearts
824    With an vn- slipping knot, take {Anthony},
825    {Octauia} to his wife: whose beauty claimes
826    No worse a husband then the best of men: whose
827    Vertue, and whose generall graces, speake
828    That which none else can vtter. By this marriage,
829    All little Ielousies which now seeme great,
830    And all great feares, which now import their dangers,
831    Would then be nothing. Truth's would be tales,
832    Where now halfe tales be truth's: her loue to both,
833    Would each to other, and all loues to both
834    Draw after her. Pardon what I haue spoke,
835    For 'tis a studied not a present thought,
836    By duty ruminated.
837    <S {Anth}.> Will {Caesar} speake?
838    <S {Caesar}.> Not till he heares how {Anthony} is toucht,
839    With what is spoke already.
840    <S {Anth}.> What power is in {Agrippa},
841    If I would say {Agrippa}, be it so,
842    To make this good?
843    <S {Caesar}.> The power of {Caesar},
844    And his power, vnto {Octauia}.
845    <S {Anth}.> May I neuer
846    (To this good purpose, that so fairely shewes)
847    Dreame of impediment: let me haue thy hand
848    Further this act of Grace: and from this houre,
849    The heart of Brothers gouerne in our Loues,
850    And sway our great Designes.
851    <S {Caesar}.> There's my hand:
852    A Sister I bequeath you, whom no Brother
853    Did euer loue so deerely. Let her liue
854    To ioyne our kingdomes, and our hearts, and neuer
855    Flie off our Loues againe.
856    <S {Lepi}.> Happily, Amen.
857   *<S {Ant}.> I did not think to draw my Sword 'gainst {Pompey},
858    For he hath laid strange courtesies, and great
859    Of late vpon me. I must thanke him onely,
860    Least my remembrance, suffer #ill report:
861    At heele of that, defie him.
862    <S {Lepi}.> Time cals vpon's,
863    Of vs must {Pompey} presently be sought,
864    Or else he seekes out vs.
865    <S {Anth}.> Where lies he?
866    <S {Caesar}.> About the Mount- Mesena.
867    <S {Anth}.> What is his strength by land?
868    <S {Caesar}.> Great, and encreasing:
869    But by Sea he is an absolute Master.
870    <S {Anth}.> So is the Fame.
871    Would we had spoke together. #Hast we for it,
872    Yet ere we put our selues in Armes, dispatch we
873    The businesse we haue talkt of.
874    <S {Caesar}.> With most gladnesse,
875    And do inuite you to my Sisters view,
      <P xx4>
876    Whether straight Ile lead you.
877    <S {Anth}.> Let vs {Lepidus} not lacke your companie.
878   *<S {Lep}.> Noble {Anthony}, not sickenesse should detaine
879    me.
880    <D {Flourish. Exit omnes}.
881    {Manet Enobarbus, Agrippa, Mecenas}.>
882    <S {Mec}.> Welcome from Aegypt Sir.
883   *<S {Eno}.> Halfe the heart of {Caesar}, worthy {Mecenas}. My
884    honourable Friend {Agrippa}.
885    <S {Agri}.> Good {Enobarbus}.
886   *<S {Mece}.> We haue cause to be glad, that matters are so
887    well disgested: you staid well by't in Egypt.
888   *<S {Enob}.> #I Sir, we did sleepe day out of countenaunce:
889    and made the night light with drinking.
890   *<S {Mece}.> Eight Wilde- Boares rosted whole at a break-fast:
891    and but twelue persons there. Is this true?
892   *<S {Eno}.> This was but as a Flye by an Eagle: we had much
893   *more monstrous matter of Feast, which worthily deser-ued
894    noting.
895   *<S {Mecenas}.> She's a most triumphant Lady, if report be
896    square to her.
897   *<S {Enob}.> When she first met {Marke Anthony}, she purst
898    vp his heart vpon the Riuer of Sidnis.
899   *<S {Agri}.> There she appear'd indeed: or my reporter de-uis'd
900    well for her.
901    <S {Eno}.> I will tell you,
902    The Barge she sat in, like a burnisht Throne
903    Burnt on the water: the Poope was beaten Gold,
904    Purple the Sailes: and so perfumed that
905    The Windes were Loue- sicke.
906    With them the Owers were Siluer,
907    Which to the tune of Flutes kept stroke, and made
908    The water which they beate, to follow faster;
909    As amorous of their strokes. For her owne person,
910    It beggerd all discription, she did lye
911    In her Pauillion, cloth of Gold, of Tissue,
912    O're- picturing that Venus, where we see
913    The fancie out- worke Nature. On each side her,
914    Stood pretty Dimpled Boyes, like smiling Cupids,
915    With diuers coulour'd Fannes whose winde did seeme,
916    To gloue the delicate cheekes which they did coole,
917    And what they vndid did.
918    <S {Agrip}.> Oh rare for {Anthony}.
919    <S {Eno}.> Her Gentlewoman, like the Nereides,
920    So many Mer- maides tended her i'th' eyes,
921    And made their bends adornings. At the Helme,
922    A seeming Mer- maide steeres: The Silken Tackle,
923    Swell with the touches of those Flower- soft hands,
924    That yarely frame the office. From the Barge
925    A strange inuisible perfume hits the sense
926    Of the adiacent Wharfes. The Citty cast
927    Her people out vpon her: and {Anthony}
928    Enthron'd i'th' Market- place, did sit alone,
929    Whisling to'th' ayre: which but for vacancie,
930    Had gone to gaze on {Cleopater} too,
931    And made a gap in Nature.
932    <S {Agri}.> Rare Egiptian.
933    <S {Eno}.> Vpon her landing, {Anthony} sent to her,
934    Inuited her to Supper: she replyed,
935    It should be better, he became her guest:
936    Which she entreated, our Courteous {Anthony},
937    Whom nere the word of no woman hard speake,
938    Being barber'd ten times o're, goes to the Feast;
939    And for his ordinary, paies his heart,
940    For what his eyes eate onely.
941    <S {Agri}.> Royall Wench:
942    She made great {Caesar} lay his Sword to bed,
943    He ploughed her, and she cropt.
944    <S {Eno}.> I saw her once
945    Hop forty Paces through the publicke streete,
946    And hauing lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
947    That she did make defect, perfection,
948    And breathlesse powre breath forth.
949    <S {Mece}.> Now {Anthony}, must leaue her vtterly.
950    <S {Eno}.> Neuer he will not:
951    Age cannot wither her, nor custome stale
952    Her infinite variety: other women cloy
953    The appetites they feede, but she makes hungry,
954    Where most she satisfies. For vildest things
955    Become themselues in her, that the holy Priests
956    Blesse her, when she is Riggish.
957    <S {Mece}.> If Beauty, Wisedome, Modesty, can settle
958    The heart of {Anthony}: {Octauia} is
959    A blessed Lottery to him.
960   *<S {Agrip}.> Let vs go. Good {Enobarbus}, make your selfe
961    my guest, whilst you abide heere.
962    <S {Eno}.> Humbly Sir I thanke you.  <D {Exeunt}>
963    <D {Enter Anthony, Caesar, Octauia betweene them}.>
964    <S {Anth}.> The world, and my great office, will
965    Sometimes deuide me from your bosome.
966   *<S {Octa}.> All which time, before the Gods my knee shall
967    bowe my prayers to them for you.
968    <S {Anth}.> Goodnight Sir. My {Octauia}
969    Read not my blemishes in the worlds report:
970    I haue not kept my square, but that to come
971    Shall all be done byth' Rule: good night deere Lady:
972    Good night Sir.
973    <S {Caesar}.> Goodnight.  <D {Exit}.>
974    <D {Enter Soothsaier}.>
975   *<S {Anth}.> Now sirrah: you do wish your selfe in Egypt?
976   *<S {Sooth}.> Would I had neuer come from thence, nor you
977    thither.
978    <S {Ant}.> If you can, your reason?
979   *<S {Sooth}.> I see it in my motion: haue it not in my tongue,
980    But yet hie you to Egypt againe.
981   *<S {Antho}.> Say to me, whose Fortunes shall rise higher
982    {Caesars} or mine?
983   *<S {Sooth}.> {Caesars}. Therefore (oh {Anthony}) stay not by his side
984    Thy Daemon that thy spirit which keepes thee, is
985    Noble, Couragious, high vnmatchable,
986    Where {Caesars} is not. But neere him, thy Angell
987    Becomes a feare: as being o're- powr'd, therefore
988    Make space enough betweene you.
989    <S {Anth}.> Speake this no more.
990   *<S {Sooth}.> To none but thee no more but: when to thee,
991    If thou dost play with him at any game,
992    Thou art sure to loose: And of that Naturall lucke,
993    He beats thee 'gainst the oddes. Thy Luster thickens,
994    When he shines by: I say againe, thy spirit
995    Is all affraid to gouerne thee neere him:
996    But he alway 'tis Noble.
997    <S {Anth}.> Get thee gone:
998    Say to {Ventigius} I would speake with him. <D {Exit}.>
999    He shall to Parthia, be it #Art or hap,
1000   He hath spoken true. The very Dice obey him,
1001   And in our sports my better cunning faints,
1002   Vnder his chance, if we draw lots he speeds,
1003   His Cocks do winne the Battaile, still of mine,
1004   When it is all to naught: and his Quailes euer
1005   Beate mine (in hoopt) at odd's. I will to Egypte:
      <P xx4v>
1006   And though I make this marriage for my peace,
1007   I'th' East my pleasure lies. Oh come {Ventigius}.
1008   <D {Enter Ventigius}.>
1009   You must to Parthia, your Commissions ready:
1010   Follow me, and reciue't.  <D {Exeunt}>
1011   <D {Enter Lepidus, Mecenas and Agrippa}.>
1012  *<S {Lepidus}.> Trouble your selues no further: pray you
1013   hasten your Generals after.
1014  *<S {Agr}.> Sir, {Marke Anthony}, will e'ne but kisse {Octauia},
1015   and weele follow.
1016   <S {Lepi}.> Till I shall see you in your Souldiers dresse,
1017   Which will become you both: Farewell.
1018  *<S {Mece}.> We shall: as I conceiue the iourney, be at
1019   Mount before you {Lepidus}.
1020  *<S {Lepi}.> Your way is shorter, my purposes do draw me
1021   much about, you'le win two dayes vpon me.
1022   <S {Both}.> Sir good successe.
1023   <S {Lepi}.> Farewell.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1024   <D {Enter Cleopater, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas}.>
1025  *<S {Cleo}.> Giue me some Musicke: Musicke, moody foode
1026   of vs that trade in Loue.
1027   <S {Omnes}.> The Musicke, hoa.
1028   <D {Enter Mardian the Eunuch}.>
1029   <S {Cleo}.> Let it alone, let's to Billiards: come {Charmian}.
1030   <S {Char}.> My arme is sore, best play with {Mardian}.
1031  *<S {Cleopa}.> As well a woman with an Eunuch plaide, as
1032   with a woman. Come you'le play with me Sir?
1033   <S {Mardi}.> As well as I can Madam.
1034   <S {Cleo}.> And when good #will is shewed,
1035   Though't come #to short
1036   The Actor may pleade pardon. Ile none now,
1037   Giue me mine Angle, weele to'th' Riuer there
1038   My Musicke playing farre off. I will betray
1039   Tawny fine fishes, my bended hooke shall pierce
1040   Their slimy iawes: and as I draw them vp,
1041   Ile thinke them euery one an {Anthony},
1042   And say, ah ha; y'are caught.
1043  *<S {Char}.> 'Twas merry when you wager'd on your Ang-ling,
1044  *when your diuer did hang a salt fish on his hooke
1045   which he with feruencie drew vp.
1046   <S {Cleo}.> That time? Oh times:
1047   I laught him out of patience: and that night
1048   I laught him into patience, and next morne,
1049   Ere the ninth houre, I drunke him to his bed:
1050   Then put my Tires and Mantles on him, whilst
1051   I wore his Sword Phillippan. Oh from Italie,
1052   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1053   Ramme thou thy fruitefull tidings in mine eares,
1054   That long time haue bin barren.
1055   <S {Mes}.> Madam, Madam.
1056   <S {Cleo}.> {Anthonyo}'s dead.
1057   If thou say so Villaine, thou kil'st thy Mistris:
1058   But well and free, if thou so yeild him.
1059   There is Gold, and heere
1060   My blewest vaines to kisse: a hand that Kings
1061   Haue lipt, and trembled kissing.
1062   <S {Mes}.> First Madam, he is well.
1063   <S {Cleo}.> Why there's more Gold.
1064   But sirrah marke, we vse
1065   To say, the dead are well: bring it to that,
1066   The Gold I giue thee, will I melt and powr
1067   Downe thy #ill vttering throate.
1068   <S {Mes}.> Good Madam heare me.
1069   <S {Cleo}.> Well, go #too I will:
1070   But there's no goodnesse in thy face if {Anthony}
1071   Be free and healthfull; so tart a fauour
1072   To trumpet such good tidings. If not well,
1073   Thou shouldst come like a Furie crown'd with Snakes,
1074   Not like a formall man.
1075   <S {Mes}.> #Wilt please you heare me?
1076   <S {Cleo}.> I haue a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
1077   Yet if thou say {Anthony} liues, 'tis well,
1078   Or friends with {Caesar}, or not Captiue to him,
1079   Ile set thee in a shower of Gold, and haile
1080   Rich Pearles vpon thee.
1081   <S {Mes}.> Madam, he's well.
1082   <S {Cleo}.> Well said.
1083   <S {Mes}.> And Friends with {Caesar}.
1084   <S {Cleo}.> Th'art an honest man.
1085   <S {Mes}.> {Caesar}, and he, are greater Friends then euer.
1086   <S {Cleo}.> Make thee a Fortune from me.
1087   <S {Mes}.> But yet Madam.
1088   <S {Cleo}.> I do not like #but yet, it does alay
1089   The good precedence, fie vpon #but yet,
1090   But yet is as a Iaylor to bring foorth
1091   Some monstrous Malefactor. Prythee Friend,
1092   Powre out the packe of matter to mine eare,
1093   The good and bad together: he's friends with {Caesar},
1094   In state of health thou saist, and thou saist, free.
1095   <S {Mes}.> Free Madam, no: I made no such report,
1096   He's bound vnto {Octauia}.
1097   <S {Cleo}.> For what good turne?
1098   <S {Mes}.> For the best turne i'th' bed.
1099   <S {Cleo}.> I am pale {Charmian}.
1100   <S {Mes}.> Madam, he's married to {Octauia}.
1101   <S {Cleo}.> The most infectious Pestilence vpon thee.
1102   <D {Strikes him downe}.>
1103   <S {Mes}.> Good Madam patience.
1104   <S {Cleo}.> What say you? <D {Strikes him}.>
1105   Hence horrible Villaine, or Ile spurne thine eyes
1106   Like balls before me: Ile vnhaire thy head,
1107   <D {She hales him vp and downe}.>
1108   Thou shalt be whipt with Wyer, and stew'd in brine,
1109   Smarting in lingring pickle.
1110   <S {Mes}.> Gratious Madam,
1111   I that do bring the newes, made not the match.
1112   <S {Cleo}.> Say 'tis not so, a Prouince I will giue thee,
1113   And make thy Fortunes proud: the blow thou had'st
1114   Shall make thy peace, for mouing me to rage,
1115   And I will boot thee with what guift beside
1116   Thy modestie can begge.
1117   <S {Mes}.> He's married Madam.
1118   <S {Cleo}.> Rogue, thou hast liu'd too long.  <D {Draw a knife}.>
1119   <S {Mes}.> Nay then Ile runne:
1120   What meane you Madam, I haue made no fault.  <D {Exit}.>
1121  *<S {Char}.> Good Madam keepe your selfe within your selfe,
1122   The man is innocent.
1123   <S {Cleo}.> Some Innocents scape not the thunderbolt:
1124   Melt Egypt into Nyle: and kindly creatures
1125   Turne all to Serpents. Call the slaue againe,
1126   Though I am mad, I will not byte him: Call?
1127   <S {Char}.> He is afeard to come.
1128   <S {Cleo}.> I will not hurt him,
1129   These hands do lacke Nobility, that they strike
1130   A meaner then my selfe: since I my selfe
1131   Haue giuen my selfe the cause. Come hither Sir.
1132   <D {Enter the Messenger againe}.>
1133   Though it be honest, it is neuer good
1134   To bring bad newes: giue to a gratious Message
      <P xx5>
1135   An host of tongues, but let #ill tydings tell
1136   Themselues, when they be felt.
1137   <S {Mes}.> I haue done my duty.
1138   <S {Cleo}.> Is he married?
1139   I cannot hate thee worser then I do,
1140   If thou againe say yes.
1141   <S {Mes}.> He's married Madam.
1142   <S {Cleo}.> The Gods confound thee,
1143   Dost thou hold there still?
1144   <S {Mes}.> Should I lye Madame?
1145   <S {Cleo}.> Oh, I would thou didst:
1146   So halfe my Egypt were submerg'd and made
1147   A Cesterne for scal'd Snakes. Go get thee hence,
1148   Had'st thou {Narcissus} in thy face to me,
1149   Thou would'st appeere most vgly: He is married?
1150   <S {Mes}.> I craue your Highnesse pardon.
1151   <S {Cleo}.> He is married?
1152   <S {Mes}.> Take no offence, that I would not offend you,
1153   To punnish me for what you make me do
1154   Seemes much vnequall, he's married to {Octauia}.
1155   <S {Cleo}.> Oh that his fault should make a knaue of thee,
1156   That art not what th'art sure of. Get thee hence,
1157  *The Marchandize which thou hast brought from Rome
1158   Are all too deere for me:
1159   Lye they vpon thy hand, and be vndone by em.
1160   <S {Char}.> Good your Highnesse patience.
1161   <S {Cleo}.> In praysing {Anthony}, I haue disprais'd {Caesar}.
1162   <S {Char}.> Many times Madam.
1163   <S {Cleo}.> I am paid for't now: lead me from hence,
1164   I faint, oh {Iras}, {Charmian}: 'tis no matter.
1165   Go to the Fellow, good {Alexas} bid him
1166   Report the feature of {Octauia}: her yeares,
1167   Her inclination, let him not leaue out
1168   The colour of her haire. Bring me word quickly,
1169   Let him for euer go, let him not {Charmian},
1170   Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
1171   The other wayes a Mars. Bid you {Alexas}
1172   Bring me word, how tall she is: pitty me {Charmian},
1173   But do not speake to me. Lead me to my Chamber.
1174   <D {Exeunt}.>
1175  *<D {Flourish. Enter Pompey, at one doore with Drum and Trum-pet}:
1176  *{at another Caesar, Lepidus, Anthony, Enobarbus, Me-cenas},
1177   {Agrippa, Menas with Souldiers Marching}.>
1178   <S {Pom}.> Your Hostages I haue, so haue you mine:
1179   And we shall talke before we fight.
1180   <S {Caesar}.> Most meete that first we come to words,
1181   And therefore haue we
1182   Our written purposes before vs sent,
1183   Which if thou hast considered, let vs know,
1184   If 'twill tye vp thy discontented Sword,
1185   And carry backe to Cicelie much tall youth,
1186   That else must perish heere.
1187   <S {Pom}.> To you all three,
1188   The Senators alone of this great world,
1189   Chiefe Factors for the Gods. I do not know,
1190   Wherefore my Father should reuengers want,
1191   Hauing a Sonne and Friends, since {Iulius Caesar},
1192   Who at Phillippi the good {Brutus} ghosted,
1193   There saw you labouring for him. What #was't
1194   That mou'd pale {Cassius} to conspire? And what
1195   Made all- honor'd, honest, Romaine {Brutus},
1196   With the arm'd rest, Courtiers of beautious freedome,
1197   To drench the Capitoll, but that they would
1198   Haue one man but a man, and that #his it
1199   Hath made me rigge my Nauie. At whose burthen,
1200   The anger'd Ocean fomes, with which I meant
1201   To scourge th' ingratitude, that despightfull Rome
1202   Cast on my Noble Father.
1203   <S {Caesar}.> Take your time.
1204  *<S {Ant}.> Thou can'st not feare vs {Pompey} with thy sailes.
1205   Weele speake with thee at Sea. At land thou know'st
1206   How much we do o're- count thee.
1207   <S {Pom}.> At Land indeed
1208   Thou dost orecount  me of my Fathers house:
1209   But since the Cuckoo buildes not for himselfe,
1210   Remaine in't as thou maist.
1211   <S {Lepi}.> Be pleas'd to tell vs,
1212   (For this is from the present how you take)
1213   The offers we haue sent you.
1214   <S {Caesar}.> There's the point.
1215   <S {Ant}.> Which do not be entreated #too,
1216   But waigh what it is worth imbrac'd
1217  *<S {Caesar}.> And what may follow to try a larger Fortune.
1218   <S {Pom}.> You haue made me offer
1219   Of Cicelie, Sardinia: and I must
1220   Rid all the Sea of Pirats. Then, to send
1221   Measures of Wheate to Rome: this greed vpon,
1222   To part with vnhackt edges, and beare backe
1223   Our Targes vndinted.
1224   <S {Omnes}.> That's our offer.
1225   <S {Pom}.> Know then I came before you heere,
1226   A man prepar'd
1227   To take this offer. But {Marke Anthony},
1228   Put me to some impatience: though I loose
1229   The praise of it by telling. You must know
1230   When {Caesar} and your Brother were at blowes,
1231   Your Mother came to Cicelie, and did finde
1232   Her welcome Friendly.
1233   <S {Ant}.> I haue heard it {Pompey},
1234   And am well studied for a liberall thanks,
1235   Which I do owe you.
1236   <S {Pom}.> Let me haue your hand:
1237   I did not thinke Sir, to haue met you heere,
1238   <S {Ant}.> The beds i'th' East are soft, and thanks to you,
1239   That cal'd me timelier then my purpose hither:
1240   For I haue gained by't.
1241  *<S {Caesar}.> Since I saw you last, ther's a change vpon you.
1242   <S {Pom}.> Well, I know not,
1243   What counts harsh Fortune cast's vpon my face,
1244   But in my bosome shall she neuer come,
1245   To make my heart her vassaile.
1246   <S {Lep}.> Well met heere.
1247   <S {Pom}.> I hope so {Lepidus}, thus we are agreed:
1248   I craue our composion may be written
1249   And seal'd betweene vs,
1250   <S {Caesar}.> That's the next to do.
1251   <S {Pom}.> Weele feast each other, ere we part, and lett's
1252   Draw lots who shall begin.
1253   <S {Ant}.> That will I {Pompey}.
1254  *<S {Pompey}.> No {Anthony} take the lot: but first or last,
1255  *your fine Egyptian cookerie shall haue the fame, I haue
1256   heard that {Iulius Caesar}, grew fat with feasting there.
1257   <S {Anth}.> You haue heard much.
1258   <S {Pom}.> I haue faire meaning Sir.
1259   <S {Ant}.> And faire words to them.
1260   <S {Pom}.> Then so much haue I heard,
1261   And I haue heard {Appolodorus} carried===
1262   <S {Eno}.> No more that: he did so.
1263   <S {Pom}.> What I pray you?
1264   <S {Eno}.> A certaine Queene to {Caesar} in a Matris.
1265   <S {Pom}.> I know thee now, how far'st thou Souldier?
1266   <S {Eno}.> Well, and well am like to do, for I perceiue
      <P xx5v><C B>
1267   Foure Feasts are toward.
1268   <S {Pom}.> Let me shake thy hand,
1269   I neuer hated thee: I haue seene thee fight,
1270   When I haue enuied thy behauiour.
1271  *<S {Enob}.> Sir, I neuer lou'd you much, but I #ha' prais'd ye,
1272   When you haue well deseru'd ten times as much,
1273   As I haue said you did.
1274   <S {Pom}.> Inioy thy plainnesse,
1275   It nothing #ill becomes thee:
1276   Aboord my Gally, I inuite you all.
1277   Will you leade Lords?
1278   <S {All}.> Shew's the way, sir.
1279   <S {Pom}.> Come.  <D {Exeunt.  Manet Enob. & Menas}>
1280  *<S {Men}.> Thy Father {Pompey} would ne're haue made this
1281   Treaty. You, and I haue knowne sir.
1282   <S {Enob}.> At Sea, I thinke.
1283   <S {Men}.> We haue Sir.
1284   <S {Enob}.> You haue done well by water.
1285   <S {Men}.> And you by Land.
1286  *<S {Enob}.> I will praise any man that will praise me, thogh
1287   it cannot be denied what I haue done by Land.
1288   <S {Men}.> Nor what I haue done by water.
1289  *<S {Enob}.> Yes some- thing you can deny for your owne
1290   safety: you haue bin a great Theefe by Sea.
1291   <S {Men}.> And you by Land.
1292  *<S {Enob}.> There I deny my Land seruice: but giue mee
1293  *your hand {Menas}, if our eyes had authority, heere they
1294   might take two Theeues kissing.
1295  *<S {Men}.> All mens faces are true, whatsomere their hands
1296   are.
1297  *<S {Enob}.> But there is neuer a fayre Woman, ha's a true
1298   Face.
1299   <S {Men}.> No slander, they steale hearts.
1300   <S {Enob}.> We came hither to fight with you.
1301  *<S {Men}.> For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a Drink-ing.
1302   {#Pompey} doth this day laugh away his Fortune.
1303   <S {Enob}.> If he do, sure he cannot weep't backe againe.
1304  *<S {Men}.> Y'haue said Sir, we look'd not for {Marke An-thony}
1305   heere, pray you, is he married to {Cleopatra}?
1306   <S {Enob}.> {Caesars} Sister is call'd {Octauia}.
1307   <S {Men}.> True Sir, she was the wife of {Caius Marcellus}.
1308  *<S {Enob}.> But she is now the wife of {Marcus Anthonius}.
1309   <S {Men}.> Pray'ye sir.
1310   <S {Enob}.> 'Tis true.
1311   <S {Men}.> Then is {Caesar} and he, for euer knit together.
1312  *<S {Enob}.> If I were bound to Diuine of this vnity, I wold
1313   not Prophesie so.
1314  *<S {Men}.> I thinke the policy of that purpose, made more
1315   in the Marriage, then the loue of the parties.
1316  *<S {Enob}.> I thinke so too. But you shall finde the band
1317  *that seemes to tye their friendship together, will bee the
1318  *very strangler of their Amity: {Octauia} is of a holy, cold,
1319   and still conuersation.
1320   <S {Men}.> Who would not haue his wife so?
1321  *<S {Eno}.> Not he that himselfe is not so: which is {Marke}
1322  *{Anthony}: he will to his Egyptian dish againe: then shall
1323  *the sighes of {Octauia} blow the fire vp in {Caesar}, and (as I
1324  *said before) that which is the strength of their Amity,
1325  *shall proue the immediate Author of their variance. {An-thony}
1326  *will vse his affection where it is. Hee married but
1327   his occasion heere.
1328  *<S {Men}.> And thus it may be. Come Sir, will you aboord?
1329   I haue a health for you.
1330  *<S {Enob}.> I shall take it sir: we haue vs'd our Throats in
1331   Egypt.
1332   <S {Men}.> Come, let's away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1333   <D {Musicke playes}.
1334   {Enter two or three Seruants with a Banket}.>
1335  *<S 1> Heere they'l be man: some #o' their Plants are #ill
1336  *rooted already, the least winde i'th' world wil blow them
1337   downe.
1338   <S 2> {Lepidus} is high Coulord.
1339   <S 1> They haue made him drinke Almes drinke.
1340  *<S 2> As they pinch one another by the disposition, hee
1341  *cries out, no more; reconciles them to his entreatie, and
1342   himselfe to'th' drinke.
1343  *<S 1> But it raises the greater warre betweene him & his
1344   discretion.
1345  *<S 2> Why this it is to haue a name in great mens Fel-lowship:
1346  *I had as liue haue a Reede that will doe me no
1347   seruice, as a Partizan I could not heaue.
1348  *<S 1> To be call'd into a huge Sphere, and not to be seene
1349  *to moue in't, are the holes where eyes should bee, which
1350   pittifully disaster the cheekes.
1351   <D {A Sennet sounded}.
1352  *{Enter Caesar, Anthony, Pompey, Lepidus, Agrippa, Mecenas},
1353   {Enobarbus, Menes, with other Captaines}.>
1354  *<S {Ant}.> Thus do they Sir: they take the flow o'th' Nyle
1355   By certaine scales i'th' Pyramid: they know
1356   By'th' height, the lownesse, or the meane: If dearth
1357   Or Foizon follow. The higher Nilus swels,
1358   The more it promises: as it ebbes, the Seedsman
1359   Vpon the slime and Ooze scatters his graine,
1360   #And shortly comes to Haruest.
1361   <S {Lep}.> Y'haue strange Serpents there?
1362   <S {Anth}.> #I {Lepidus}.
1363  *<S {Lep}.> Your Serpent of Egypt, is bred now of your mud
1364   by the operation of your Sun: so is your Crocodile.
1365   <S {Ant}.> They are so.
1366   <S {Pom}.> Sit, and some Wine: A health to {Lepidus}.
1367   <S {Lep}.> I am not so well as I should be:
1368   But Ile ne're out.
1369  *<S {Enob}.> Not till you haue slept: I feare me you'l bee in
1370   till then.
1371  *<S {Lep}.> Nay certainly, I haue heard the {Ptolomies} Pyra-misis
1372  *are very goodly things: without contradiction I
1373   haue heard that.
1374   <S {Menas}.> {Pompey}, a word.
1375   <S {Pomp}.> Say in mine eare, what is't.
1376   <S {Men}.> Forsake thy seate I do beseech thee Captaine,
1377   And heare me speake a word.
1378   <S {Pom}.> Forbeare me till anon.  <D {Whispers in's Eare}.>
1379   This Wine for {Lepidus}.
1380   <S {Lep}.> What manner #o' thing is your Crocodile?
1381  *<S {Ant}.> It is shap'd sir like it selfe, and it is as broad as it
1382  *hath bredth; It is iust so high as it is, and mooues with #it
1383  *owne organs. It liues by that which nourisheth it, and
1384   the Elements once out of it, it Transmigrates.
1385   <S {Lep}.> What colour is it of?
1386   <S {Ant}.> Of #it owne colour too.
1387   <S {Lep}.> 'Tis a strange Serpent.
1388   <S {Ant}.> 'Tis so, and the teares of it are wet.
1389   <S {Caes}.> Will this description satisfie him?
1390  *<S {Ant}.> With the Health that {Pompey} giues him, else he
1391   is a very Epicure.
1392   <S {Pomp}.> Go hang sir, hang: tell me of that? Away:
1393   Do as I bid you. Where's this Cup I call'd for?
1394   <S {Men}.> If for the sake of Merit thou wilt heare mee,
      <P xx6><C E>
1395   Rise from thy stoole.
1396   <S {Pom}.> I thinke th'art mad: the matter?
1397   <S {Men}.> I haue euer held my cap off to thy Fortunes.
1398  *<S {Pom}.> Thou hast seru'd me with much faith: what's
1399   else to say? Be iolly Lords.
1400   <S {Anth}.> These Quicke- sands {Lepidus},
1401   Keepe off, them for you sinke.
1402   <S {Men}.> Wilt thou be Lord of all the world?
1403   <S {Pom}.> What saist thou?
1404   <S {Men}.> Wilt thou be Lord of the whole world?
1405   That's twice.
1406   <S {Pom}.> How should that be?
1407  *<S {Men}.> But entertaine it, and though thou thinke me
1408   poore, I am the man will giue thee all the world.
1409   <S {Pom}.> Hast thou drunke well.
1410   <S {Men}.> No {Pompey}, I haue kept me from the cup,
1411   Thou art if thou dar'st be, the earthly Ioue:
1412   What ere the Ocean pales, or skie inclippes,
1413   Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
1414   <S {Pom}.> Shew me which way?
1415  *<S {Men}.> These three World- sharers, these Competitors
1416   Are in thy vessell. Let me cut the Cable,
1417   And when we are put off, fall to their throates:
1418   All there is thine.
1419   <S {Pom}.> Ah, this thou shouldst haue done,
1420   And not haue spoke on't. In me 'tis villanie,
1421   In thee, 't had bin good seruice: thou must know,
1422   'Tis not my profit that does lead mine Honour:
1423   Mine Honour it, Repent that ere thy tongue,
1424   Hath so betraide thine acte. Being done vnknowne,
1425   I should haue found it afterwards well done,
1426   But must condemne it now: desist, and drinke.
1427   <S {Men}.> For this, Ile neuer follow
1428   Thy paul'd Fortunes more,
1429   Who seekes and will not take, when once 'tis offer'd,
1430   Shall neuer finde it more.
1431   <S {Pom}.> This health to {Lepidus}.
1432   <S {Ant}.> Beare him ashore,
1433   Ile pledge it for him {Pompey}.
1434   <S {Eno}.> Heere's to thee {Menas}.
1435   <S {Men}.> {Enobarbus}, welcome.
1436   <S {Pom}.> Fill till the cup be hid.
1437   <S {Eno}.> There's a strong Fellow {Menas}.
1438   <S {Men}.> Why?
1439  *<S {Eno}.> #A beares the third part of the world man: seest
1440   not?
1441  *<S {Men}.> The third part, then he is drunk: would it were
1442   all, that it might go on wheeles.
1443   <S {Eno}.> Drinke thou: encrease the Reeles.
1444   <S {Men}.> Come.
1445   <S {Pom}.> This is not yet an Alexandrian Feast.
1446   <S {Ant}.> It ripen's, towards it: strike the Vessells hoa.
1447   Heere's to {Caesar}.
1448  *<S {Caesar}.> I could well forbear't, it's monstrous labour
1449   when I wash my braine, and it grow fouler.
1450   <S {Ant}.> Be a Child o'th' time.
1451  *<S {Caesar}.> Possesse it, Ile make answer: but I had rather
1452   fast from all, foure dayes, then drinke so much in one.
1453  *<S {Enob}.> Ha my braue Emperour, shall we daunce now
1454   the Egyptian Backenals, and celebrate our drinke?
1455   <S {Pom}.> Let's ha't good Souldier.
1456   <S {Ant}.> Come, let's all take hands,
1457   Till that the conquering Wine hath steep't our sense,
1458   In soft and delicate Lethe.
1459   <S {Eno}.> All take hands:
1460   Make battery to our eares with the loud Musicke,
1461   The while, Ile place you, then the Boy shall sing.
1462   The holding euery man shall beate as loud,
1463   As his strong sides can volly.

1474   Let me request you #of our grauer businesse
1475   Frownes at this leuitie. Gentle Lords let's part,
1476   You see we haue burnt our cheekes. Strong {Enobarbe}
1477   Is weaker then the Wine, and mine owne tongue

1498   Make me reuenger. Beare the Kings Sonnes body,
1499   Before our Army, thy {Pacorus Orades},
1500   Paies this for {Marcus Crassus}.
1501   <S {Romaine}.> Noble {Ventidius},
1502   Whil'st yet with Parthian blood thy Sword is warme,
1503  *The Fugitiue Parthians follow. Spurre through Media,
1504   Mesapotamia, and the shelters, whether
1505   The routed flie. So thy grand Captaine {Anthony}
1506   Shall set thee on triumphant Chariots, and
1507   Put Garlands on thy head.
1508   <S {Ven}.> Oh {Sillius, Sillius},
1509   I haue done enough. A lower place note well
1510   May make too great an act. For learne this {Sillius},
1511   Better to leaue vndone, then by our deed
1512   Acquire too high a Fame, when him we serues away.
1513   {#Caesar} and {Anthony}, haue euer wonne
1514   More in their officer, then person. {Sossius}
1515   One of my place in Syria, his Lieutenant,
1516   For quicke accumulation of renowne,
1517   Which he atchiu'd by'th' minute, lost his fauour.
1518   Who does i'th' Warres more then his Captaine can,
1519   Becomes his Captaines Captaine: and Ambition
1520   (The Souldiers vertue) rather makes choise of losse
1521   Then gaine, which darkens him.
1522   I could do more to do {Anthonius} good,
1523   But 'twould offend him. And in his offence,
      <P xx6v>
1524   Should my performance perish.
1525  *<S {Rom}.> Thou hast {Ventidius} that, without the which a
1526  *Souldier and his Sword graunts scarce distinction: thou
1527   wilt write to {Anthony}.
1528   <S {Ven}.> Ile humbly signifie what in his name,
1529   That magicall word of Warre we haue effected,
1530   How with his Banners, and his well paid ranks,
1531   The nere- yet beaten Horse of Parthia,
1532   We haue iaded out o'th' Field.
1533   <S {Rom}.> Where is he now?
1534  *<S {Ven}.> He purposeth to Athens, whither with what #hast
1535   The waight we must conuay with's, will permit:
1536   We shall appeare before him. On there, passe along.
1537   <D {Exeunt}.>
1538   <D {Enter Agrippa at one doore, Enobarbus at another}.>
1539   <S {Agri}.> What are the Brothers parted?
1540   <S {Eno}.> They haue dispatcht with {Pompey}, he is gone,
1541   The other three are Sealing. {Octauia} weepes
1542   To part from Rome: {Caesar} is sad, and {Lepidus}
1543   Since {Pompey's} feast, as {Menas} saies, is troubled
1544   With the Greene- Sicknesse.
1545   <S {Agri}.> 'Tis a Noble {Lepidus}.
1546   <S {Eno}.> A very fine one: oh, how he loues {Caesar}.
1547  *<S {Agri}.> Nay but how deerely he adores {Mark Anthony}.
1548   <S {Eno}.> {Caesar}? why he's the Iupiter of men.
1549   <S {Ant}.> What's {Anthony}, the God of Iupiter?
1550   <S {Eno}.> Spake you of {Caesar}? How, the non- pareill?
1551   <S {Agri}.> Oh {Anthony}, oh thou Arabian Bird!
1552  *<S {Eno}.> Would you praise {Caesar}, say {Caesar} go no further.
1553  *<S {Agr}.> Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises.
1554   <S {Eno}.> But he loues {Caesar} best, yet he loues {Anthony}:
1555   Hoo, Hearts, Tongues, Figure,
1556   Scribes, Bards, Poets, cannot
1557   Thinke speake, cast, write, sing, number: hoo,
1558   His loue to {Anthony}. But as for {Caesar},
1559   Kneele downe, kneele downe, and wonder.
1560   <S {Agri}.> Both he loues.
1561   <S {Eno}.> They are his Shards, and he their Beetle, so:
1562   This is to horse: Adieu, Noble {Agrippa}.
1563  *<S {Agri}.> Good Fortune worthy Souldier, and farewell.
1564   <D {Enter Caesar, Anthony, Lepidus, and Octauia}.>
1565   <S {Antho}.> No further Sir.
1566   <S {Caesar}.> You take from me a great part of my selfe:
1567   Vse me well in't. Sister, proue such a wife
1568   As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest Band
1569   Shall passe on thy approofe: most Noble {Anthony},
1570   Let not the peece of Vertue which is set
1571   Betwixt vs, as the Cyment of our loue
1572   To keepe it builded, be the Ramme to batter
1573   The Fortresse of it: for better might we
1574   Haue lou'd without this meane, if on both parts
1575   This be not cherisht.
1576   <S {Ant}.> Make me not offended, in your distrust.
1577   <S {Caesar}.> I haue said.
1578   <S {Ant}.> You shall not finde,
1579   Though you be therein curious, the lest cause
1580   For what you seeme to feare, so the Gods keepe you,
1581   And make the hearts of Romaines serue your ends:
1582   We will heere part.
1583   <S {Caesar}.> Farewell my deerest Sister, fare thee well,
1584   The Elements be kind to thee, and make
1585   Thy spirits all of comfort: fare thee well.
1586   <S {Octa}.> My Noble Brother.
1587   <S {Anth}.> The Aprill's in her eyes, it is Loues spring,
1588   And these the showers to bring it on: be cheerfull.
1589  *<S {Octa}.> Sir, looke well to my Husbands house: and===
1590   <S {Caesar}.> What {Octauia}?
1591   <S {Octa}.> Ile tell you in your eare.
1592   <S {Ant}.> Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
1593   Her heart informe her tongue.
1594   The Swannes downe feather
1595   That stands vpon the Swell at the full of Tide:
1596   And neither way inclines.
1597   <S {Eno}.> Will {Caesar} weepe?
1598   <S {Agr}.> He ha's a cloud in's face.
1599  *<S {Eno}.> He were the worse for that were he a Horse, so is
1600   he being a man.
1601   <S {Agri}.> Why {Enobarbus}:
1602   When {Anthony} found {Iulius Caesar} dead,
1603   He cried almost to roaring: And he wept,
1604   When at Phillippi he found {Brutus} slaine.
1605  *<S {Eno}.> That year indeed, he was trobled with a rheume,
1606   What willingly he did confound, he wail'd,
1607   Beleeu't till I weepe too.
1608   <S {Caesar}.> No sweet {Octauia},
1609   You shall heare from me still: the time shall not
1610   Out- go my thinking on you.
1611   <S {Ant}.> Come Sir, come,
1612   Ile wrastle with you in my strength of loue,
1613   Looke heere I haue you, thus I let you go,
1614   And giue you to the Gods.
1615   <S {Caesar}.> Adieu, be happy.
1616   <S {Lep}.> Let all the number of the Starres giue light
1617   To thy faire way.
1618   <S {Caesar}.> Farewell, farewell.  <D {Kisses Octauia}.>
1619   <S {Ant}.> Farewell.  <D {Trumpets sound.  Exeunt}.>
1620   <D {Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas}.>
1621   <S {Cleo}.> Where is the Fellow?
1622   <S {Alex}.> Halfe afeard to come.
1623   <S {Cleo}.> Go #too, go #too: Come hither Sir.
1624   <D {Enter the Messenger as before}.>
1625  *<S {Alex}.> Good Maiestie: {Herod} of Iury dare not looke
1626   vpon you, but when you are well pleas'd.
1627  *<S {Cleo}.> That {Herods} head, Ile haue: but how? When
1628  *{Anthony} is gone, through whom I might commaund it:
1629   Come thou neere.
1630   <S {Mes}.> Most gratious Maiestie.
1631   <S {Cleo}.> Did'st thou behold {Octauia}?
1632   <S {Mes}.> #I dread Queene.
1633   <S {Cleo}.> Where?
1634  *<S {Mes}.> Madam in Rome, I lookt her in the face: and
1635  *saw her led betweene her Brother, and {Marke Anthony}.
1636   <S {Cleo}.> Is she as tall as me?
1637   <S {Mes}.> She is not Madam.
1638   <S {Cleo}.> Didst heare her speake?
1639   Is she shrill tongu'd or low?
1640   <S {Mes}.> Madam, I heard her speake, she is low voic'd.
1641   <S {Cleo}.> That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
1642   <S {Char}.> Like her? Oh {Isis}: 'tis impossible.
1643  *<S {Cleo}.> I thinke so {Charmian}: dull of tongue, & dwarfish
1644   What Maiestie is in her gate, remember
1645   If ere thou look'st on Maiestie.
1646  *<S {Mes}.> She creepes: her motion, & her station are as one.
1647   She shewes a body, rather then a life,
1648   A Statue, then a Breather.
1649   <S {Cleo}.> Is this certaine?
1650   <S {Mes}.> Or I haue no obseruance.
1651   <S {Cha}.> Three in Egypt cannot make better note.
1652   <S {Cleo}.> He's very knowing, I do perceiu't,
1653   There's nothing in her yet.
      <P yy1>
1654   The Fellow ha's good iudgement.
1655   <S {Char}.> Excellent.
1656   <S {Cleo}.> Guesse at her yeares, I prythee.
1657   <S {Mess}.> Madam, she was a widdow.
1658   <S {Cleo}.> Widdow? {Charmian}, hearke.
1659   <S {Mes}.> And I do thinke she's thirtie.
1660  *<S {Cle}.> Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
1661   <S {Mess}.> Round, euen to faultinesse.
1662  *<S {Cleo}.> For the most part too, they are foolish that are
1663   so. Her haire what colour?
1664   <S {Mess}.> Browne Madam: and her forehead
1665   As low as she would wish it.
1666   <S {Cleo}.> There's Gold for thee,
1667   Thou must not take my former sharpenesse #ill,
1668   I will employ thee backe againe: I finde thee
1669   Most fit for businesse. Go, make thee ready,
1670   Our Letters are prepar'd.
1671   <S {Char}.> A proper man.
1672   <S {Cleo}.> Indeed he is so: I repent me much
1673   That so I harried him. Why me think's by him,
1674   This Creature's no such thing.
1675   <S {Char}.> Nothing Madam.
1676  *<S {Cleo}.> The man hath seene some Maiesty, and should
1677   know.
1678  *<S {Char}.> Hath he seene Maiestie? {Isis} else defend: and
1679   seruing you so long.
1680  *<S {Cleopa}.> I haue one thing more to aske him yet good
1681  *{Charmian}: but 'tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me
1682   where I will write; all may be well enough.
1683   <S {Char}.> I warrant you Madam.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1684   <D {Enter Anthony and Octauia}.>
1685   <S {Ant}.> Nay, nay {Octauia}, not onely that,
1686   That were excusable, that and thousands more
1687   Of semblable import, but he hath wag'd
1688  *New Warres 'gainst {Pompey}. Made his #will, and read it,
1689   To publicke eare, spoke scantly of me,
1690   When perforce he could not
1691   But pay me tearmes of Honour: cold and sickly
1692   He vented then most narrow measure: lent me,
1693   When the best hint was giuen him: he not took't,
1694   Or did it from his teeth.
1695   <S {Octaui}.> Oh my good Lord,
1696   Beleeue not all, or if you must beleeue,
1697   Stomacke not all. A more vnhappie Lady,
1698   If this deuision chance, ne're stood betweene
1699   Praying for both parts:
1700   The good Gods wil mocke me presently,
1701   When I shall pray: Oh blesse my Lord, and Husband,
1702   Vndo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
1703  *Oh blesse my Brother. Husband winne, winne Brother,
1704   Prayes, and distroyes the prayer, no midway
1705   'Twixt these extreames at all.
1706   <S {Ant}.> Gentle {Octauia},
1707   Let your best loue draw to that point which seeks
1708   Best to preserue it: if I loose mine Honour,
1709   I loose my selfe: better I were not yours
1710   Then your so branchlesse. But as you requested,
1711   Your selfe shall go between's, the meane time Lady,
1712   Ile raise the preparation of a Warre
1713   Shall staine your Brother, make your soonest #hast,
1714   So your desires are yours.
1715   <S {Oct}.> Thanks to my Lord,
1716   The Ioue of power make me most weake, most weake,
1717   Your reconciler: Warres 'twixt you twaine would be,
1718   As if the world should cleaue, and that slaine men
1719   Should soalder vp the Rift.
1720   <S {Anth}.> When it appeeres to you where this begins,
1721   Turne your displeasure that way, for our faults
1722   Can neuer be so equall, that your loue
1723   Can equally moue with them. Prouide your going,
1724   Choose your owne company, and command what cost
1725   Your heart he's mind #too.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1726   <D {Enter Enobarbus, and Eros}.>
1727   <S {Eno}.> How now Friend {Eros}?
1728   <S {Eros}.> Ther's strange Newes come Sir.
1729   <S {Eno}.> What man?
1730  *<S {Ero}.> {Caesar} & {Lepidus} haue made warres vpon {Pompey}.
1731   <S {Eno}.> This is old, what is the successe?
1732  *<S {Eros}.> {Caesar} hauing made vse of him in the warres
1733  *'gainst {Pompey}: presently denied him riuality, would not
1734  *let him partake in the glory of the action, and not resting
1735  *here, accuses him of Letters he had formerly wrote to
1736  *{#Pompey}. Vpon his owne appeale seizes him, so the poore
1737   third is vp, till death enlarge his Confine.
1738  *<S {Eno}.> Then would thou hadst a paire of chaps no more,
1739  *and throw betweene them all the food thou hast, they'le
1740   grinde the other. Where's {Anthony}?
1741   <S {Eros}.> He's walking in the garden thus, and spurnes
1742   The rush that lies before him. Cries Foole {Lepidus},
1743   And threats the throate of that his Officer,
1744   That murdred {Pompey}.
1745   <S {Eno}.> Our great Nauies rig'd.
1746   <S {Eros}.> For Italy and {Caesar}, more {Domitius},
1747   My Lord desires you presently: my Newes
1748   I might haue told heareafter.
1749  *<S {Eno}.> 'Twillbe naught, but let it be: bring me to {Anthony}.
1750   <S {Eros}.> Come Sir,  <D {Exeunt}.>
1751   <D {Enter Agrippa, Mecenas, and Caesar}.>
1752  *<S {Caes}.> Contemning Rome he ha's done all this, & more
1753   In Alexandria: heere's the manner of't:
1754   I'th' Market- place on a Tribunall siluer'd,
1755   {Cleopatra} and himselfe in Chaires of Gold
1756   Were publikely enthron'd: at the feet, sat
1757   {Caesarion} whom they call my Fathers Sonne,
1758   And all the vnlawfull issue, that their Lust
1759   Since then hath made betweene them. Vnto her,
1760   He gaue the stablishment of Egypt, made her
1761   Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, absolute Queene.
1762   <S {Mece}.> This in the publike eye?
1763  *<S {Caesar}.> I'th' common shew place, where they exercise,
1764   His Sonnes hither proclaimed the King of Kings,
1765   Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
1766   He gaue to {Alexander}. To {Ptolomy} he assign'd,
1767   Syria, Silicia, and Phoenetia: she
1768   In th' abiliments of the Goddesse {Isis}
1769   That day appeer'd, and oft before gaue audience,
1770   As 'tis reported so.
1771   <S {Mece}.> Let Rome be thus inform'd.
1772   <S {Agri}.> Who queazie with his insolence already,
1773   Will their good thoughts call from him.
1774   <S {Caesar}.> The people knowes it,
1775   And haue now receiu'd his accusations.
1776   <S {Agri}.> Who does he accuse?
1777   <S {Caesar}.> {Caesar}, and that hauing in Cicilie
1778   {Sextus Pompeius} spoil'd, we had not rated him
1779   His part o'th' Isle. Then does he say, he lent me
1780   Some shipping vnrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
1781   That {Lepidus} of the Triumpherate, should be depos'd,
1782   And being that, we detaine all his Reuenue.
1783   <S {Agri}.> Sir, this should be answer'd.
1784   <S {Caesar}.> 'Tis done already, and the Messenger gone:
1785   I haue told him {Lepidus} was growne too cruell,
      <P yy1v><C B>
1786   That he his high Authority abus'd,
1787  *And did deserue his change: for what I haue conquer'd,
1788   I grant him part: but then in his Armenia,
1789  *And other of his conquer'd Kingdoms, I demand the like
1790   <S {Mec}.> Hee'l neuer yeeld to that.
1791   <S {Caes}.> Nor must not then be yeelded to in this.
1792   <D {Enter Octauia with her Traine}.>
1793  *<S {Octa}.> Haile {Caesar}, and my L[ord]. haile most deere {Caesar}.
1794   <S {Caesar}.> That euer I should call thee Cast- away.
1795   <S {Octa}.> You haue not call'd me so, nor haue you cause.
1796  *<S {Caes}.> Why haue you stoln vpon vs thus? you come not
1797   Like {Caesars} Sister, The wife of {Anthony}
1798   Should haue an Army for an Vsher, and
1799   The neighes of Horse to tell of her approach,
1800   Long ere she did appeare. The trees by'th' way
1801   Should haue borne men, and expectation fainted,
1802   Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
1803   Should haue ascended to the Roofe of Heauen,
1804   Rais'd by your populous Troopes: But you are come
1805   A Market- maid to Rome, and haue preuented
1806   The ostentation of our loue; which left vnshewne,
1807   Is often left vnlou'd: we should haue met you
1808   By Sea, and Land, supplying euery Stage
1809   With an augmented greeting.
1810   <S {Octa}.> Good my Lord,
1811   To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
1812   On my free- will. My Lord {Marke Anthony},
1813   Hearing that you prepar'd for Warre, acquainted
1814   My greeued eare withall: whereon I begg'd
1815   His pardon for returne.
1816   <S {Caes}.> Which soone he granted,
1817   Being an abstract 'tweene his Lust, and him.
1818   <S {Octa}.> Do not say so, my Lord.
1819   <S {Caes}.> I haue eyes vpon him,
1820  *And his affaires come to me on the wind: wher is he now?
1821   <S {Octa}.> My Lord, in Athens.
1822   <S {Caesar}.> No my most wronged Sister, {Cleopatra}
1823   Hath nodded him to her. He hath giuen his Empire
1824   Vp to a Whore, who now are leuying
1825   The Kings o'th' earth for Warre. He hath assembled,
1826   {Bochus} the King of Lybia, {Archilaus}
1827   Of Cappadocia, {Philadelphos} King
1828   Of Paphlagonia: the Thracian King {Adullas},
1829   King {Manchus} of Arabia, King of Pont,
1830   {Herod} of Iewry, {Mithridates} King
1831   Of Comageat, {Polemen} and {Amintas},
1832   The Kings of Mede, and Licoania,
1833   With a more larger List of Scepters.
1834   <S {Octa}.> Aye me most wretched,
1835   That haue my heart parted betwixt two Friends,
1836   That does afflict each other.
1837  *<S {Caes}.> Welcom hither: your Letters did with- holde our |(breaking forth
1838   Till we perceiu'd both how you were wrong led,
1839   And we in negligent danger: cheere your heart,
1840   Be you not troubled with the time, which driues
1841   O're your content, these strong necessities,
1842   But let determin'd things to destinie
1843   Hold vnbewayl'd their way. Welcome to Rome,
1844   Nothing more deere to me: You are abus'd
1845   Beyond the marke of thought: and the high Gods
1846   To do you Iustice, makes his Ministers
1847   Of vs, and those that loue you. Best of comfort,
1848   And euer welcom to vs.  <S {Agrip}.> Welcome Lady.
1849   <S {Mec}.> Welcome deere Madam,
1850   Each heart in Rome does loue and pitty you,
1851   Onely th' adulterous {Anthony}, most large
1852   In his abhominations, turnes you off,
1853   And giues his potent Regiment to a Trull
1854   That noyses it against vs.
1855   <S {Octa}.> Is it so sir?
1856   <S {Caes}.> Most certaine: Sister welcome: pray you
1857   Be euer knowne to patience. My deer'st Sister.  <D {Exeunt}>
1858   <D {Enter Cleopatra, and Enobarbus}.>
1859   <S {Cleo}.> I will be euen with thee, doubt it not.
1860   <S {Eno}.> But why, why, why?
1861  *<S {Cleo}.> Thou hast forespoke my being in these warres,
1862   And say'st it is not fit.
1863   <S {Eno}.> Well: is it, is it.
1864  *<S {Cleo}.> If not, denounc'd against vs, why should not
1865   we be there in person.
1866  *<S {Enob}.> Well, I could reply: if wee should serue with
1867  *Horse and Mares together, the Horse were meerly lost:
1868   the Mares would beare a Soldiour and his Horse.
1869   <S {Cleo}.> What is't you say?
1870   <S {Enob}.> Your presence needs must puzle {Anthony},
1871   Take from his heart, take from his Braine, from's time,
1872   What should not then be spar'd. He is already
1873   Traduc'd for Leuity, and 'tis said in Rome,
1874   That {Photinus} an Eunuch, and your Maides
1875   Mannage this warre.
1876   <S {Cleo}.> Sinke Rome, and their tongues rot
1877   That speake against vs. A Charge we beare i'th' Warre,
1878   And as the president of my Kingdome will
1879   Appeare there for a man. Speake not against it,
1880   I will not stay behinde.
1881   <D {Enter Anthony and Camidias}.>
1882   <S {Eno}.> Nay I haue done, here comes the Emperor.
1883   <S {Ant}.> Is it not strange {Camidius},
1884   That from Tarientum, and Brandusium,
1885   He could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea,
1886   And take in Troine. You haue heard on't (Sweet?)
1887   <S {Cleo}.> Celerity is neuer more admir'd,
1888   Then by the negligent.
1889   <S {Ant}.> A good rebuke,
1890   Which might haue well becom'd the best of men
1891   To taunt at slacknesse. {Camidius}, wee
1892   Will fight with him by Sea.
1893   <S {Cleo}.> By Sea, what else?
1894   <S {Cam}.> Why will my Lord, do so?
1895   <S {Ant}.> For that he dares vs too't.
1896   <S {Enob}.> So hath my Lord, dar'd him to single fight.
1897   <S {Cam}.> #I, and to wage this Battell at Pharsalia,
1898   Where {Caesar} fought with {Pompey}. But these offers
1899   Which serue not for his vantage, he shakes off,
1900   And so should you.
1901   <S {Enob}.> Your Shippes are not well mann'd,
1902   Your Marriners are Militers, Reapers, people
1903   Ingrost by swift Impresse. In {Caesars} Fleete,
1904   Are those, that often haue 'gainst {Pompey} fought,
1905   Their shippes are #yare, yours heauy: no disgrace
1906   Shall fall you for refusing him at Sea,
1907   Being prepar'd for Land.
1908   <S {Ant}.> By Sea, by Sea.
1909   <S {Eno}.> Most worthy Sir, you therein throw away
1910   The absolute Soldiership you haue by Land,
1911   Distract your Armie, which doth most consist
1912   Of Warre- markt- footmen, leaue vnexecuted
1913   Your owne renowned knowledge, quite forgoe
1914   The way which promises assurance, and
1915   Giue vp your selfe meerly to chance and hazard,
1916   From firme Securitie.
1917   <S {Ant}.> Ile fight at Sea.
      <P yy2>
1918   <S {Cleo}.> I haue sixty Sailes, {Caesar} none better.
1919   <S {Ant}.> Our ouer- plus of shipping will we burne,
1920   And with the rest full mann'd, from th' head of Action
1921   Beate th' approaching {Caesar}. But if we faile,
1922   We then can doo't at Land.  <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1923   Thy Businesse?
1924   <S {Mes}.> The Newes is true, my Lord, he is descried,
1925   {#Caesar} ha's taken Toryne.
1926   <S {Ant}.> Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible
1927   Strange, that his power should be. {Camidius},
1928   Our nineteene Legions thou shalt hold by Land,
1929   And our twelue thousand Horse. Wee'l to our Ship,
1930   Away my {Thetis}.
1931   <D {Enter a Soldiour}.>
1932   How now worthy Souldier?
1933   <S {Soul}.> Oh Noble Emperor, do not fight by Sea,
1934   Trust not to rotten plankes: Do you misdoubt
1935   This Sword, and these my Wounds; let th' Egyptians
1936   And the Phoenicians go #a ducking: wee
1937   Haue vs'd to conquer standing on the earth,
1938   And fighting foot to foot.
1939   <S {Ant}.> Well, well, away.  <D {exit Ant. Cleo. & Enob}.>
1940   <S {Soul}.> By {Hercules} I thinke I am i'th' right.
1941  *<S {Cam}.> Souldier thou art: but his whole action growes
1942   Not in the power on't: so our Leaders leade,
1943   And we are Womens mens.
1944  *<S {Soul}.> You keepe by Land the Legions and the Horse
1945   whole, do you not?
1946   <S {Ven}.> {Marcus Octauius, Marcus Iusteus},
1947   {Publicola}, and {Celius}, are for Sea:
1948   But we keepe whole by Land. This speede of {Caesars}
1949   Carries beyond beleefe.
1950   <S {Soul}.> While he was yet in Rome,
1951   His power went out in such distractions,
1952   As beguilde all Spies.
1953   <S {Cam}.> Who's his Lieutenant, heare you?
1954   <S {Soul}.> They say, one {Towrus}.
1955   <S {Cam}.> Well, I know the man.
1956   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
1957   <S {Mes}.> The Emperor cals {Camidius}.
1958   <S {Cam}.> With Newes the times with Labour,
1959   And throwes forth each minute, some.  <D {exeunt}>
1960   <D {Enter Caesar with his Army, marching}.>
1961   <S {Caes}.> {Towrus}?
1962   <S {Tow}.> My Lord.
1963   <S {Caes}.> Strike not by Land,
1964   Keepe whole, prouoke not Battaile
1965   Till we haue done at Sea. Do not exceede
1966   The Prescript of this Scroule: Our fortune lyes
1967   Vpon this iumpe. <D {exit}.>
1968   <D {Enter Anthony, and Enobarbus}.>
1969   <S {Ant}.> Set we our Squadrons on yond side o'th' Hill,
1970   In eye of {Caesars} battaile, from which place
1971   We may the number of the Ships behold,
1972   And so proceed accordingly.  <D {exit}.>
1973  *<D {Camidius Marcheth with his Land Army one way ouer the}
1974   {stage, and Towrus the Lieutenant of Caesar the other way}:
1975   {After their going in, is heard the noise of a Sea fight}.
1976   {Alarum. Enter Enobarbus and Scarus}.>
1977  *<S {Eno}.> Naught, naught, al naught, I can behold no longer:
1978   {Thantoniad}, the Egyptian Admirall,
1979   With all their sixty flye, and turne the Rudder:
1980   To see't, mine eyes are blasted.
1981   <D {Enter Scarrus}.>
1982  *<S {Scar}.> Gods, & Goddesses, all the whol synod of them!
1983   <S {Eno}.> What's thy passion.
1984   <S {Scar}.> The greater Cantle of the world, is lost
1985   With very ignorance, we haue kist away
1986   Kingdomes, and Prouinces.
1987   <S {Eno}.> How appeares the Fight?
1988   <S {Scar}.> On our side, like the Token'd Pestilence,
1989   Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred Nagge of Egypt,
1990   (Whom Leprosie o're- take) i'th' midst o'th' fight,
1991   When vantage like a payre of Twinnes appear'd
1992   Both as the same, or rather ours the elder;
1993   (The Breeze vpon her) like a Cow in Iune,
1994   Hoists Sailes, and flyes.
1995   <S {Eno}.> That I beheld:
1996   Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
1997   Indure a further view.
1998   <S {Scar}.> She once being looft,
1999   The Noble ruine of her Magicke, {Anthony},
2000   Claps on his Sea- wing, and (like a doting Mallard)
2001   Leauing the Fight in heighth, flyes after her:
2002   I neuer saw an Action of such shame;
2003   Experience, Man- hood, Honor, ne're before,
2004   Did violate so it selfe.
2005   <S {Enob}.> Alacke, alacke.
2006   <D {Enter Camidius}.>
2007   <S {Cam}.> Our Fortune on the Sea is out of breath,
2008   And sinkes most lamentably. Had our Generall
2009   Bin what he knew himselfe, it had gone well:
2010   Oh #his ha's giuen example for our flight,
2011   Most grossely by his owne.
2012  *<S {Enob}.> #I, are you thereabouts? Why then goodnight
2013   indeede.
2014   <S {Cam}.> Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
2015   <S {Scar}.> 'Tis easie toot,
2016   And there I will attend what further comes.
2017   <S {Camid}.> To {Caesar} will I render
2018   My Legions and my Horse, sixe Kings alreadie
2019   Shew me the way of yeelding.
2020   <S {Eno}.> Ile yet follow
2021   The wounded chance of {Anthony}, though my reason
2022   Sits in the winde against me.
2023   <D {Enter Anthony with Attendants}.>
2024  *<S {Ant}.> Hearke, the Land bids me tread no more vpon't,
2025   It is asham'd to beare me. Friends, come hither,
2026   I am so lated in the world, that I
2027   Haue lost my way for euer. I haue a shippe,
2028   Laden with Gold, take that, diuide it: flye,
2029   And make your peace with {Caesar}.
2030   <S {Omnes}.> Fly? Not wee.
2031  *<S {Ant}.> I haue fled my selfe, and haue instructed cowards
2032   To runne, and shew their shoulders. Friends be gone,
2033   I haue my selfe resolu'd vpon a course,
2034   Which has no neede of you. Be gone,
2035   My Treasure's in the Harbour. Take it: Oh,
2036   I follow'd that I blush to looke vpon,
2037   My very haires do mutiny: for the white
2038   Reproue the browne for rashnesse, and they them
2039   For feare, and doting. Friends be gone, you shall
2040   Haue Letters from me to some Friends, that will
2041   Sweepe your way for you. Pray you looke not sad,
2042   Nor make replyes of loathnesse, take the hint
2043   Which my dispaire proclaimes. Let them be left
2044   Which leaues it selfe, to the Sea- side straight way;
2045   I will possesse you of that ship and Treasure.
      <P yy2v>
2046   Leaue me, I pray a little: pray you now,
2047   Nay do so: for indeede I haue lost command,
2048   Therefore I pray you, Ile see you #by and by.  <D {Sits downe}>
2049   <D {Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian and Eros}.>
2050   <S {Eros}.> Nay gentle Madam, to him, comfort him.
2051   <S {Iras}.> Do most deere Queene.
2052   <S {Char}.> Do, why, what else?
2053   <S {Cleo}.> Let me sit downe: Oh {Iuno}.
2054   <S {Ant}.> No, no, no, no, no.
2055   <S {Eros}.> See you heere, Sir?
2056   <S {Ant}.> Oh fie, fie, fie.
2057   <S {Char}.> Madam.
2058   <S {Iras}.> Madam, oh good Empresse.
2059   <S {Eros}.> Sir, sir.
2060   <S {Ant}.> Yes my Lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
2061   His sword e'ne like a dancer, while I strooke
2062   The leane and wrinkled {Cassius}, and 'twas I
2063   That the mad {Brutus} ended: he alone
2064   Dealt on Lieutenantry, and no practise had
2065   In the braue squares of Warre: yet now: no matter.
2066   <S {Cleo}.> Ah stand by.
2067   <S {Eros}.> The Queene my Lord, the Queene.
2068   <S {Iras}.> Go to him, Madam, speake to him,
2069   Hee's vnqualitied with very shame.
2070   <S {Cleo}.> Well then, sustaine me: Oh.
2071  *<S {Eros}.> Most Noble Sir arise, the Queene approaches,
2072   Her head's declin'd, and death will cease her, but
2073   Your comfort makes the rescue.
2074   <S {Ant}.> I haue offended Reputation,
2075   A most vnnoble sweruing.
2076   <S {Eros}.> Sir, the Queene.
2077   <S {Ant}.> Oh whether hast thou lead me Egypt, see
2078   How I conuey my shame, out of thine eyes,
2079   By looking backe what I haue left behinde
2080   Stroy'd in dishonor.
2081   <S {Cleo}.> Oh my Lord, my Lord,
2082   Forgiue my fearfull sayles, I little thought
2083   You would haue followed.
2084   <S {Ant}.> Egypt, thou knew'st too well,
2085   My heart was to thy Rudder tyed by'th' strings,
2086   And thou should'st towe me after. O're my spirit
2087   The full supremacie thou knew'st, and that
2088   Thy becke, might from the bidding of the Gods
2089   Command mee.
2090   <S {Cleo}.> Oh my pardon.
2091   <S {Ant}.> Now I must
2092   To the young man send humble Treaties, dodge
2093   And palter in the shifts of lownes, who
2094   With halfe the bulke o'th' world plaid as I pleas'd,
2095   Making, and marring Fortunes. You did know
2096   How much you were my Conqueror, and that
2097   My Sword, made weake by my affection, would
2098   Obey it on all cause.
2099   <S {Cleo}.> Pardon, pardon.
2100   <S {Ant}.> Fall not a teare I say, one of them rates
2101   All that is wonne and lost: Giue me a kisse,
2102   Euen this repayes me.
2103   We sent our Schoolemaster, is #a come backe?
2104   Loue I am full of Lead: some Wine
2105   Within there, and our Viands: Fortune knowes,
2106  *We scorne her most, when most she offers blowes.  <D {Exeunt}>
2107   <D {Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Dollabello, with others}.>
2108   <S {Caes}.> Let him appeare that's come from {Anthony}.
2109   Know you him.
2110   <S {Dolla}.> {Caesar}, 'tis his Schoolemaster,
2111   An argument that he is pluckt, when hither
2112   He sends so poore a Pinnion of his Wing,
2113   Which had superfluous Kings for Messengers,
2114   Not many Moones gone by.
2115   <D {Enter Ambassador from Anthony}.>
2116   <S {Caesar}.> Approach, and speake.
2117   <S {Amb}.> Such as I am, I come from {Anthony}:
2118   I was of late as petty to his ends,
2119   As is the Morne- dew on the Mertle leafe
2120   To his grand Sea.
2121   <S {Caes}.> Bee't so, declare thine office.
2122   <S {Amb}.> Lord of his Fortunes he salutes thee, and
2123   Requires to liue in Egypt, which not granted
2124   He Lessons his Requests, and to thee sues
2125   To let him breath betweene the Heauens and Earth
2126   A priuate man in Athens: this for him.
2127   Next, {Cleopatra} does confesse thy Greatnesse,
2128   Submits her to thy #might, and of thee craues
2129   The Circle of the {Ptolomies} for her heyres,
2130   Now hazarded to thy Grace.
2131   <S {Caes}.> For {Anthony},
2132   I haue no eares to his request. The Queene,
2133   Of Audience, nor Desire shall faile, so shee
2134   From Egypt driue her all- disgraced Friend,
2135   Or take his life there. This if shee performe,
2136   She shall not sue vnheard. So to them both.
2137   <S {Amb}.> Fortune pursue thee.
2138   <S {Caes}.> Bring him through the Bands:
2139   To try thy Eloquence, now 'tis time, dispatch,
2140   From {Anthony} winne {Cleopatra}, promise
2141   And in our Name, what she requires, adde more
2142   From thine inuention, offers. Women are not
2143   In their best Fortunes strong; but want will periure
2144   The ne're touch'd Vestall. Try thy cunning {Thidias},
2145   Make thine owne Edict for thy paines, which we
2146   Will answer as a Law.
2147   <S {Thid}.> {Caesar}. I go.
2148   <S {Caesar}.> Obserue how {Anthony} becomes his flaw,
2149   And what thou think'st his very action speakes
2150   In euery power that mooues.
2151   <S {Thid}.> {Caesar}, I shall.  <D {exeunt}.>
2152   <D {Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, & Iras}.>
2153   <S {Cleo}.> What shall we do, {Enobarbus}?
2154   <S {Eno}.> Thinke, and dye.
2155   <S {Cleo}.> Is {Anthony}, or we in fault for this?
2156   <S {Eno}.> {Anthony} onely, that would make his #will
2157   Lord of his Reason. What though you fled,
2158   From that great face of Warre, whose seuerall ranges
2159   Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
2160   The itch of his Affection should not then
2161   Haue nickt his Captain- ship, at such a point,
2162   When halfe to halfe the world oppos'd, he being
2163   The meered question? 'Twas a shame no lesse
2164   Then was his losse, to course your flying Flagges,
2165   And leaue his Nauy gazing.
2166   <S {Cleo}.> Prythee peace.
2167   <D {Enter the Ambassador, with Anthony}.>
2168   <S {Ant}.> Is that his answer? <S {Amb}.> #I my Lord.
2169   <S {Ant}.> The Queene shall then haue courtesie,
2170   So she will yeeld vs vp.
2171   <S {Am}.> He sayes so.
2172  *<S {Antho}.> Let her know't. To the Boy {Caesar} send this
2173  *grizled head, and he will fill thy wishes to the brimme,
2174   With Principalities.
2175   <S {Cleo}.> That head my Lord?
      <P yy3>
2176   <S {Ant}.> To him againe, tell him he weares the Rose
2177  *Of youth vpon him: from which, the world should note
2178   Something particular: His Coine, Ships, Legions,
2179   May be a Cowards, whose Ministers would preuaile
2180   Vnder the seruice of a Childe, as soone
2181   As i'th' Command of {Caesar}. I dare him therefore
2182   To lay his gay Comparisons a- part,
2183   And answer me declin'd, Sword against Sword,
2184   Our selues alone: Ile write it: Follow me.
2185   <S {Eno}.> Yes like enough: hye battel'd {Caesar} will
2186   Vnstate his happinesse, and be Stag'd to'th' shew
2187   Against a Sworder. I see mens Iudgements are
2188   A parcell of their Fortunes, and things outward
2189   Do draw the inward quality after them
2190   To suffer all alike, that he should dreame,
2191   Knowing all measures, the full {Caesar} will
2192   Answer his emptinesse; {Caesar} thou hast subdu'de
2193   His iudgement too.
2194   <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
2195   <S {Ser}.> A Messenger from {Caesar}.
2196   <S {Cleo}.> What no more Ceremony? See my Women,
2197   Against the blowne Rose may they stop their nose,
2198   That kneel'd vnto the Buds. Admit him sir.
2199   <S {Eno}.> Mine honesty, and I, beginne to square,
2200   The Loyalty well held to Fooles, does make
2201   Our Faith meere folly: yet he that can endure
2202   To follow with Allegeance a falne Lord,
2203   Does conquer him that did his Master conquer,
2204   And earnes a place i'th' Story.
2205   <D {Enter Thidias}.>
2206   <S {Cleo}.> {Caesars} #will.
2207   <S {Thid}.> Heare it apart.
2208   <S {Cleo}.> None but Friends: say boldly.
2209   <S {Thid}.> So haply are they Friends to {Anthony}.
2210   <S {Enob}.> He needs as many (Sir) as {Caesar} ha's,
2211   Or needs not vs. If {Caesar} please, our Master
2212   Will leape to be his Friend: For vs you know,
2213   Whose he is, we are, and that is {Caesars}.
2214  *<S {Thid}.> So. Thus then thou most renown'd, {Caesar} intreats,
2215   Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
2216   Further then he is {Caesars}.
2217   <S {Cleo}.> Go on, right Royall.
2218   <S {Thid}.> He knowes that you embrace not {Anthony}
2219   As you did loue, but as you feared him.
2220   <S {Cleo}.> Oh.
2221   <S {Thid}.> The scarre's vpon your Honor, therefore he
2222   Does pitty, as constrained blemishes,
2223   Not as deserued.
2224   <S {Cleo}.> He is a God,
2225   And knowes what is most right. Mine Honour
2226   Was not yeelded, but conquer'd meerely.
2227   <S {Eno}.> To be sure of that, I will aske {Anthony}.
2228   Sir, sir, thou art so leakie
2229   That we must leaue thee to thy sinking, for
2230   Thy deerest quit thee.  <D {Exit Enob}.>
2231   <S {Thid}.> Shall I say to {Caesar},
2232   What you require of him: for he partly begges
2233   To be desir'd to giue. It much would please him,
2234   That of his Fortunes you should make a staffe
2235   To leane vpon. But it would warme his spirits
2236   To heare from me you had left {Anthony},
2237  *And put your selfe vnder his shrowd, the vniuersal Land-|(lord.
2238   <S {Cleo}.> What's your name?
2239   <S {Thid}.> My name is {Thidias}.
2240   <S {Cleo}.> Most kinde Messenger,
2241   Say to great {Caesar} this in disputation,
2242   I kisse his conqu'ring hand: Tell him, I am prompt
2243   To lay my Crowne at's feete, and there to kneele.
2244   Tell him, from his all- obeying breath, I heare
2245   The doome of Egypt.
2246   <S {Thid}.> 'Tis your Noblest course:
2247   Wisedome and Fortune combatting together,
2248   If that the former dare but what it can,
2249   No chance may shake it. Giue me grace to lay
2250   My dutie on your hand.
2251   <S {Cleo}.> Your {Caesars} Father oft,
2252   (When he hath mus'd of taking kingdomes in)
2253   Bestow'd his lips on that vnworthy place,
2254   As it rain'd kisses.
2255   <D {Enter Anthony and Enobarbus}.>
2256  *<S {Ant}.> Fauours? By Ioue that thunders. What art thou |(Fellow?
2257   <S {Thid}.> One that but performes
2258   The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
2259   To haue command obey'd.
2260   <S {Eno}.> You will be whipt.
2261  *<S {Ant}.> Approch there: ah you Kite. Now Gods & diuels
2262   Authority melts from me of late. When I cried hoa,
2263   Like Boyes vnto a musse, Kings would start forth,
2264   And cry, your #will. Haue you no eares?
2265  *I am {Anthony} yet. Take hence this Iack, and whip him.
2266   <D {Enter a Seruant}.>
2267   <S {Eno}.> 'Tis better playing with a Lions whelpe,
2268   Then with an old one dying.
2269   <S {Ant}.> Moone and Starres,
2270   Whip him: #wer't twenty of the greatest Tributaries
2271   That do acknowledge {Caesar}, should I finde them
2272   So sawcy with the hand of she heere, what's her name
2273   Since she was {Cleopatra}? Whip him Fellowes,
2274   Till like a Boy you see him crindge his face,
2275   And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
2276   <S {Thid}.> {Marke Anthony}.
2277   <S {Ant}.> Tugge him away: being whipt
2278   Bring him againe, the Iacke of {Caesars} shall
2279   Beare vs an arrant to him.  <D {Exeunt with Thidius}.>
2280   You were halfe blasted ere I knew you: Ha?
2281   Haue I my pillow left vnprest in Rome,
2282   Forborne the getting of a lawfull Race,
2283   And by a Iem of women, to be abus'd
2284   By one that lookes on Feeders?
2285   <S {Cleo}.> Good my Lord.
2286   <S {Ant}.> You haue beene a boggeler euer,
2287   But when we in our viciousnesse grow hard
2288   (Oh misery on't) the wise Gods seele our eyes
2289   In our owne filth, drop our cleare iudgements, make vs
2290   Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
2291   To our confusion.
2292   <S {Cleo}.> Oh, is't come to this?
2293   <S {Ant}.> I found you as a Morsell, cold vpon
2294   Dead {Caesars} Trencher: Nay, you were a Fragment
2295   Of {Gneius Pompeyes}, besides what hotter houres
2296   Vnregistred in vulgar Fame, you haue
2297   Luxuriously pickt out. For I am sure,
2298   Though you can guesse what Temperance should be,
2299   You know not what it is.
2300   <S {Cleo}.> Wherefore is this?
2301   <S {Ant}.> To let a Fellow that will take rewards,
2302   And say, God quit you, be familiar with
2303   My play- fellow, your hand; this Kingly Seale,
2304   And plighter of high hearts. O that I were
2305   Vpon the hill of Basan, to out- roare
2306   The horned Heard, for I haue sauage cause,
2307   And to proclaime it ciuilly, were like
      <P yy3v>
2308   A halter'd necke, which do's the Hangman thanke,
2309   For being #yare about him. Is he whipt?
2310   <D {Enter a Seruant with Thidias}.>
2311   <S {Ser}.> Soundly, my Lord.
2312   <S {Ant}.> Cried he? and begg'd a Pardon?
2313   <S {Ser}.> He did aske fauour.
2314   <S {Ant}.> If that thy Father liue, let him repent
2315   Thou was't not made his daughter, and be thou sorrie
2316   To follow {Caesar} in his Triumph, since
2317   Thou hast bin whipt. For following him, henceforth
2318   The white hand of a Lady Feauer thee,
2319   Shake thou to looke on't. Get thee backe to {Caesar},
2320   Tell him thy entertainment: looke thou say
2321   He makes me angry with him. For he seemes
2322   Proud and disdainfull, harping on what I am,
2323   Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,
2324   And at this time most easie 'tis to doo't:
2325   When my good Starres, that were my former guides
2326   Haue empty left their Orbes, and shot their Fires
2327   Into th' Abisme of #hell. If he mislike,
2328   My speech, and what is done, tell him he has
2329   {Hiparchus}, my enfranched Bondman, whom
2330   He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
2331   As he shall like to quit me. Vrge it thou:
2332   Hence with thy stripes, be gone.  <D {Exit Thid}.>
2333   <S {Cleo}.> Haue you done yet?
2334   <S {Ant}.> Alacke our Terrene Moone is now Eclipst,
2335   And it portends alone the fall of {Anthony}.
2336   <S {Cleo}.> I must stay his time?
2337   <S {Ant}.> To flatter {Caesar}, would you mingle eyes
2338   With one that tyes his points.
2339   <S {Cleo}.> Not know me yet?
2340   <S {Ant}.> Cold- hearted toward me?
2341   <S {Cleo}.> Ah (Deere) if I be so,
2342   From my cold heart let Heauen ingender haile,
2343   And poyson it in the sourse, and the first stone
2344   Drop in my necke: as it determines so
2345   Dissolue my life, the next Caesarian smile,
2346   Till by degrees the memory of my wombe,
2347   Together with my braue Egyptians all,
2348   By the discandering of this pelleted storme,
2349   Lye grauelesse, till the Flies and Gnats of Nyle
2350   Haue buried them for prey.
2351   <S {Ant}.> I am satisfied:
2352   {#Caesar} sets downe in Alexandria, where
2353   I will oppose his Fate. Our force by Land,
2354   Hath Nobly held, our seuer'd Nauie too
2355   Haue knit againe, and Fleete, threatning most Sea- like.
2356   Where hast thou bin my heart? Dost thou heare Lady?
2357   If from the Field I shall returne once more
2358   To kisse these Lips, I will appeare in Blood,
2359   I, and my Sword, will earne our Chronicle,
2360   There's hope in't yet.
2361   <S {Cleo}.> That's my braue Lord.
2362   <S {Ant}.> I will be trebble- sinewed, hearted, breath'd,
2363   And fight maliciously: for when mine houres
2364   Were nice and lucky, men did ransome liues
2365   Of me for iests: But now, Ile set my teeth,
2366   And send to darkenesse all that stop me. Come,
2367   Let's haue one other gawdy night: Call to me
2368   All my sad Captaines, fill our Bowles once more:
2369   Let's mocke the midnight Bell.
2370   <S {Cleo}.> It is my Birth- day,
2371   I had thought t'haue held it poore. But since my Lord
2372   Is {Anthony} againe, I will be {Cleopatra}.
2373   <S {Ant}.> We will yet do well.
2374   <S {Cleo}.> Call all his Noble Captaines to my Lord.
2375   <S {Ant}.> Do so, wee'l speake to them,
2376   And to night Ile force
2377   The Wine peepe through their scarres.
2378   Come on (my Queene)
2379   There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
2380   Ile make death loue me: for I will contend
2381   Euen with his pestilent Sythe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2382  *<S {Eno}.> Now hee'l out- stare the Lightning, to be furious
2383   Is to be frighted out of feare, and in that moode
2384   The Doue will pecke the Estridge; and I see still
2385   A diminution in our Captaines braine,
2386   Restores his heart; when valour prayes in reason,
2387   It eates the Sword it fights with: I will seeke
2388   Some way to leaue him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2389   <D {Enter Caesar, Agrippa, & Mecenas with his Army},
2390   {Caesar reading a Letter}.>
2391   <S {Caes}.> He calles me Boy, and chides as he had power
2392   To beate me out of Egypt. My Messenger
2393  *He hath whipt with Rods, dares me to personal Combat.
2394   {#Caesar} to {Anthony}: let the old Ruffian know,
2395   I haue many other wayes to dye: meane time
2396   Laugh at his Challenge.
2397   <S {Mece}.> {Caesar} must thinke,
2398   When one so great begins to rage, hee's hunted
2399   Euen to falling. Giue him no breath, but now
2400   Make boote of his distraction: Neuer anger
2401   Made good guard for it selfe.
2402   <S {Caes}.> Let our best heads know,
2403   That to morrow, the last of many Battailes
2404   We meane to fight. Within our Files there are,
2405   Of those that seru'd {Marke Anthony} but late,
2406   Enough to fetch him in. See it done,
2407   And Feast the Army, we haue store to doo't,
2408  *And they haue earn'd the waste. Poore {Anthony}.  <D {Exeunt}>
2409   <D {Enter Anthony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian},
2410   {Iras, Alexas, with others}.>
2411   <S {Ant}.> He will not fight with me, {Domitian}?
2412   <S {Eno}.> No?
2413   <S {Ant}.> Why should he not?
2414  *<S {Eno}.> He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
2415   He is twenty men to one.
2416   <S {Ant}.> To morrow Soldier,
2417   By Sea and Land Ile fight: or I will liue,
2418   Or bathe my dying Honor in the blood
2419   Shall make it liue againe. Woo't thou fight well.
2420   <S {Eno}.> Ile strike, and cry, Take all.
2421   <S {Ant}.> Well said, come on:
2422   Call forth my Houshold Seruants, lets to night
2423   <D {Enter} 3 {or} 4 {Seruitors}.>
2424   Be bounteous at our Meale. Giue me thy hand,
2425   Thou hast bin rightly honest, so hast thou,
2426   Thou, and thou, and thou: you haue seru'd me well,
2427   And Kings haue beene your fellowes.
2428   <S {Cleo}.> What meanes this?
2429  *<S {Eno}.> 'Tis one of those odde tricks which sorow shoots
2430   Out of the minde.
2431   <S {Ant}.> And thou art honest too:
2432   I wish I could be made so many men,
2433   And all of you clapt vp together, in
2434   An {Anthony}: that I might do you seruice,
2435   So good as you haue done.
      <P yy4>
2436   <S {Omnes}.> The Gods forbid.
2437  *<S {Ant}.> Well, my good Fellowes, wait on me to night:
2438   Scant not my Cups, and make as much of me,
2439   As when mine Empire was your Fellow too,
2440   And suffer'd my command.
2441   <S {Cleo}.> What does he meane?
2442   <S {Eno}.> To make his Followers weepe.
2443   <S {Ant}.> Tend me to night;
2444   May be, it is the period of your duty,
2445   Haply you shall not see me more, or if,
2446   A mangled shadow. Perchance to morrow,
2447   You'l serue another Master. I looke on you,
2448   As one that takes his leaue. Mine honest Friends,
2449   I turne you not away, but like a Master
2450   Married to your good seruice, stay till death:
2451   Tend me to night two houres, I aske no more,
2452   And the Gods yeeld you for't.
2453   <S {Eno}.> What meane you (Sir)
2454   To giue them this discomfort? Looke they weepe,
2455   And I an Asse, am Onyon- ey'd; for shame,
2456   Transforme vs not to women.
2457   <S {Ant}.> Ho, ho, ho:
2458   Now the Witch take me, if I meant it thus.
2459   Grace grow where those drops fall (my hearty Friends)
2460   You take me in too dolorous a sense,
2461   For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
2462   To burne this night with Torches: Know (my hearts)
2463   I hope well of to morrow, and will leade you,
2464   Where rather Ile expect victorious life,
2465   Then death, and Honor. Let's to Supper, come,
2466   And drowne consideration.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2467   <D {Enter a Company of Soldiours}.>
2468   <S 1.{Sol}.> Brother, goodnight: to morrow is the day.
2469   <S 2.{Sol}.> It will determine one way: Fare you well.
2470   Heard you of nothing strange about the streets.
2471   <S 1> Nothing: what newes?
2472   <S 2> Belike 'tis but a Rumour, good night to you.
2473   <S 1> Well sir, good night.
2474   <D {They meete other Soldiers}.>
2475   <S 2> Souldiers, haue carefull Watch.
2476   <S 1> And you: Goodnight, goodnight.
2477   <D {They place themselues in euery corner of the Stage}.>
2478   <S 2> Heere we: and if to morrow
2479   Our Nauie thriue, I haue an absolute hope
2480   Our Landmen will stand vp.
2481   <S 1> 'Tis a braue Army, and full of purpose.
2482   <D {Musicke of the Hoboyes is vnder the Stage}.>
2483   <S 2> Peace, what noise?
2484   <S 1> List, list.
2485   <S 2> Hearke.
2486   <S 1> Musicke i'th' Ayre.
2487   <S 3> Vnder the earth.
2488   <S 4> It signes well, do's it not?
2489   <S 3> No.
2490   <S 1> Peace I say: What should this meane?
2491   <S 2> 'Tis the God {Hercules}, whom {Anthony} loued,
2492   Now leaues him.
2493   <S 1> Walke, let's see if other Watchmen
2494   Do heare what we do?
2495   <S 2> How now Maisters? <D {Speak together}.>
2496   <S {Omnes}.> How now? how now? do you heare this?
2497   <S 1> #I, is't not strange?
2498   <S 3> Do you heare Masters? Do you heare?
2499   <S 1> Follow the noyse so farre as we haue quarter.
2500   Let's see how it will giue off.
2501   <S {Omnes}.> Content: 'Tis strange. <D {Exeunt}.>
2502   <D {Enter Anthony and Cleopatra, with others}.>
2503   <S {Ant}.> {Eros}, mine Armour {Eros}.
2504   <S {Cleo}.> Sleepe a little.
2505   <S {Ant}.> No my Chucke. {Eros}, come mine Armor {Eros}.
2506   <D {Enter Eros}.>
2507   Come good Fellow, put thine Iron on,
2508   If Fortune be not ours to day, it is
2509   Because we braue her. Come.
2510   <S {Cleo}.> Nay, Ile helpe too, {Anthony}.
2511   What's this for? Ah let be, let be, thou art
2512   The Armourer of my heart: False, false: This, this,
2513   Sooth- law Ile helpe: Thus it must bee.
2514   <S {Ant}.> Well, well, we shall thriue now.
2515   Seest thou my good Fellow. Go, put on thy defences.
2516   <S {Eros}.> Briefely Sir.
2517   <S {Cleo}.> Is not this buckled well?
2518   <S {Ant}.> Rarely, rarely:
2519   He that vnbuckles this, till we do please
2520   To daft for our Repose, shall heare a storme.
2521   Thou fumblest {Eros}, and my Queenes a Squire
2522   More tight at this, then thou: Dispatch. O Loue,
2523   That thou couldst see my Warres to day, and knew'st
2524   The Royall Occupation, thou should'st see
2525   A Workeman in't.
2526   <D {Enter an Armed Soldier}.>
2527   Good morrow to thee, welcome,
2528   Thou look'st like him that knowes a warlike Charge:
2529   To businesse that we loue, we rise betime,
2530   And go too't with delight.
2531  *<S {Soul}.> A thousand Sir, early though't be, haue on their

2535   <S {Alex}.> The Morne is faire: Good morrow Generall.
2536   <S {All}.> Good morrow Generall.
2537   <S {Ant}.> 'Tis well blowne Lads.
2538   This Morning, like the spirit of a youth
2539   That meanes to be of note, begins betimes.
2540   So, so: Come giue me that, this way, well- sed.
2541   Fare thee well Dame, what ere becomes of me,
2542   This is a Soldiers kisse: rebukeable,
2543   And worthy shamefull checke it were, to stand
2544   On more Mechanicke Complement, Ile leaue thee.
2545   Now like a man of Steele, you that will fight,
2546   Follow me close, Ile bring you too't: Adieu. <D {Exeunt}.>
2547   <S {Char}.> Please you retyre to your Chamber?
2548   <S {Cleo}.> Lead me:
2549   He goes forth gallantly: That he and {Caesar} might
2550   Determine this great Warre in single fight;
2551   Then {Anthony}; but now. Well on. <D {Exeunt}>
2552   <D {Trumpets sound. Enter Anthony, and Eros}.>
2553   <S {Eros}.> The Gods make this a happy day to {Anthony}.
2554  *<S {Ant}.> Would thou, & those thy scars had once preuaild
2555   To make me fight at Land.
2556   <S {Eros}.> Had'st thou done so,
2557   The Kings that haue reuolted, and the Soldier
2558   That has this morning left thee, would haue still
2559   Followed thy heeles.
2560   <S {Ant}.> Whose gone this morning?
2561   <S {Eros}.> Who? one euer neere thee, call for {Enobarbus},
      <P yy4v>
2562   He shall not heare thee, or from {Caesars} Campe,
2563   Say I am none of thine.
2564   <S {Ant}.> What sayest thou?
2565   <S {Sold}.> Sir he is with {Caesar}.
2566  *<S {Eros}.> Sir, his Chests and Treasure he has not with him.
2567   <S {Ant}.> Is he gone?
2568   <S {Sol}.> Most certaine.
2569   <S {Ant}.> Go {Eros}, send his Treasure after, do it,
2570   Detaine no iot I charge thee: write to him,
2571   (I will subscribe) gentle adieu's, and greetings;
2572   Say, that I wish he neuer finde more cause
2573   To change a Master. Oh my Fortunes haue
2574   Corrupted honest men. Dispatch {Enobarbus}.  <D {Exit}>
2575   <D {Flourish. Enter Agrippa, Caesar, with Enobarbus},
2576   {and Dollabella}.>
2577   <S {Caes}.> Go forth {Agrippa}, and begin the fight:
2578   Our #will is {Anthony} be tooke aliue:
2579   Make it so knowne.
2580   <S {Agrip}.> {Caesar}, I shall.
2581   <S {Caesar}.> The time of vniuersall peace is neere:
2582   Proue this a prosp'rous day, the three nook'd world
2583   Shall beare the Oliue freely.
2584   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2585   <S {Mes}.> {Anthony} is come into the Field.
2586   <S {Caes}.> Go charge {Agrippa},
2587   Plant those that haue reuolted in the Vant,
2588   That {Anthony} may seeme to spend his Fury
2589   Vpon himselfe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2590   <S {Enob}.> {Alexas} did reuolt, and went to {Iewry} on
2591   Affaires of {Anthony}, there did disswade
2592   Great {Herod} to incline himselfe to {Caesar},
2593   And leaue his Master {Anthony}. For this paines,
2594   {#Caesar} hath hang'd him: {Camindius} and the rest
2595   That fell away, haue entertainment, but
2596   No honourable trust: I haue done #ill,
2597   Of which I do accuse my selfe so sorely,
2598   That I will ioy no more.
2599   <D {Enter a Soldier of Caesars}.>
2600   <S {Sol}.> {Enobarbus}, {Anthony}
2601   Hath after thee sent all thy Treasure, with
2602   His Bounty ouer- plus. The Messenger
2603   Came on my guard, and at thy Tent is now
2604   Vnloading of his Mules.
2605   <S {Eno}.> I giue it you.
2606   <S {Sol}.> Mocke not {Enobarbus},
2607   I tell you true: Best you saf't the bringer
2608   Out of the hoast, I must attend mine Office,
2609   Or would haue done't my selfe. Your Emperor
2610   Continues still a Ioue.  <D {Exit}>
2611   <S {Enob}.> I am alone the Villaine of the earth,
2612   And feele I am so most. Oh {Anthony},
2613   Thou #Mine of Bounty, how would'st thou haue payed
2614   My better seruice, when my turpitude
2615  *Thou dost so Crowne with Gold. This blowes my hart,
2616   If swift thought breake it not: a swifter meane
2617  *Shall out- strike thought, but thought will doo't. I feele
2618   I fight against thee: No I will go seeke
2619   Some Ditch, wherein to dye: the foul'st best fits
2620   My latter part of life. <D {Exit}.>
2621   <D {Alarum, Drummes and Trumpets}.
2622   {Enter Agrippa}.>
2623  *<S {Agrip}.> Retire, we haue engag'd our selues too farre:
2624   {#Caesar} himselfe ha's worke, and our oppression
2625   Exceeds what we expected.  <D {Exit}.>
2626   <D {Alarums}.
2627   {Enter Anthony, and Scarrus wounded}.>
2628   <S {Scar}.> O my braue Emperor, this is fought indeed,
2629   Had we done so at first, we had drouen them home
2630   With clowts about their heads.  <D {Far off}.>
2631   <S {Ant}.> Thou bleed'st apace.
2632   <S {Scar}.> I had a wound heere that was like a T,
2633   But now 'tis made an H.
2634   <S {Ant}.> They do retyre.
2635   <S {Scar}.> Wee'l beat 'em into Bench- holes, I haue yet
2636   Roome for six scotches more.
2637   <D {Enter Eros}.>
2638  *<S {Eros}.> They are beaten Sir, and our aduantage serues
2639   For a faire victory.
2640   <S {Scar}.> Let vs score their backes,
2641   And snatch 'em vp, as we take Hares behinde,
2642   'Tis sport to maul a Runner.
2643   <S {Ant}.> I will reward thee
2644   Once for thy sprightly comfort, and ten- fold
2645   For thy good valour. Come thee on.
2646   <S {Scar}.> Ile halt after.  <D {Exeunt}>
2647   <D {Alarum. Enter Anthony againe in a March}.
2648   {Scarrus, with others}.>
2649  *<S {Ant}.> We haue beate him to his Campe: Runne one
2650  *Before, & let the Queen know of our guests: to morrow
2651   Before the Sun shall see's, wee'l spill the blood
2652   That ha's to day escap'd. I thanke you all,
2653   For doughty handed are you, and haue fought
2654   Not as you seru'd the Cause, but as't had beene
2655   Each mans like mine: you haue shewne all {Hectors}.
2656   Enter the Citty, clip your Wiues, your Friends,
2657   Tell them your feats, whil'st they with ioyfull teares
2658   Wash the congealement from your wounds, and kisse
2659   The Honour'd- gashes whole.
2660   <D {Enter Cleopatra}.>
2661   Giue me thy hand,
2662   To this great Faiery, Ile commend thy acts,
2663  *Make her thankes blesse thee. Oh thou day o'th' world,
2664   Chaine mine arm'd necke, leape thou, Attyre and all
2665   Through proofe of Harnesse to my heart, and there
2666   Ride on the pants triumphing.
2667   <S {Cleo}.> Lord of Lords.
2668   Oh infinite Vertue, comm'st thou smiling from
2669   The worlds great snare vncaught.
2670   <S {Ant}.> Mine Nightingale,
2671   We haue beate them to their Beds.
2672   What Gyrle, though gray
2673  *Do somthing mingle with our yonger brown, yet #ha we
2674   A Braine that nourishes our Nerues, and can
2675   Get gole for gole of youth. Behold this man,
2676   Commend vnto his Lippes thy fauouring hand,
2677   Kisse it my Warriour: He hath fought to day,
2678   As if a God in hate of Mankinde, had
2679   Destroyed in such a shape.
2680   <S {Cleo}.> Ile giue thee Friend
2681   An Armour all of Gold: it was a Kings.
2682   <S {Ant}.> He has deseru'd it, were it Carbunkled
2683   Like holy Phoebus Carre. Giue me thy hand,
2684   Through Alexandria make a iolly March,
2685   Beare our hackt Targets, like the men that owe them.
2686   Had our great Pallace the capacity
2687   To Campe this hoast, we all would sup together,
2688   And drinke Carowses to the next dayes Fate
      <P yy5>
2689   Which promises Royall perill, Trumpetters
2690   With brazen dinne blast you the Citties eare,
2691   Make mingle with our ratling Tabourines,
2692  *That heauen and earth may strike their sounds together,
2693   Applauding our approach.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2694   <D {Enter a Centerie, and his Company, Enobarbus followes}.>
2695   <S {Cent}.> If we be not releeu'd within this houre,
2696   We must returne to'th' Court of Guard: the night
2697   Is shiny, and they say, we shall embattaile
2698   By'th' second houre i'th' Morne.
2699   <S 1.{Watch}.> This last day was a shrew'd one too's.
2700   <S {Enob}.> Oh beare me witnesse night.
2701   <S 2> What man is this?
2702   <S 1> Stand close, and list him.
2703   <S {Enob}.> Be witnesse to me (O thou blessed Moone)
2704   When men reuolted shall vpon Record
2705   Beare hatefull memory: poore {Enobarbus} did
2706   Before thy face repent.
2707   <S {Cent}.> {Enobarbus}?
2708   <S 2> Peace: Hearke further.
2709   <S {Enob}.> Oh Soueraigne Mistris of true Melancholly,
2710   The poysonous dampe of night dispunge vpon me,
2711   That Life, a very Rebell to my #will,
2712   May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
2713   Against the flint and hardnesse of my fault,
2714   Which being dried with greefe, will breake to powder,
2715   And finish all foule thoughts. Oh {Anthony},
2716   Nobler then my reuolt is Infamous,
2717   Forgiue me in thine owne particular,
2718   But let the world ranke me in Register
2719   A Master leauer, and a fugitiue:
2720   Oh {Anthony}! Oh {Anthony}!
2721   <S 1> Let's speake to him.
2722   <S {Cent}.> Let's heare him, for the things he speakes
2723   May concerne {Caesar}.
2724   <S 2> Let's do so; but he sleepes.
2725   <S {Cent}.> Swoonds rather, for so bad a Prayer as his
2726   Was neuer yet for sleepe.
2727   <S 1> Go we to him.
2728   <S 2> Awake sir, awake, speake to vs.
2729   <S 1> Heare you sir?
2730   <S {Cent}.> The hand of death hath raught him.
2731   <D {Drummes afarre off}.>
2732   Hearke the Drummes demurely wake the sleepers:
2733   Let vs beare him to'th' Court of Guard: he is of note:
2734   Our houre is fully out.
2735   <S 2> Come on then, he may recouer yet.  <D {exeunt}>
2736   <D {Enter Anthony and Scarrus, with their Army}.>
2737   <S {Ant}.> Their preparation is to day by Sea,
2738   We please them not by Land.
2739   <S {Scar}.> For both, my Lord.
2740   <S {Ant}.> I would they'ld fight i'th' Fire, or i'th' Ayre,
2741   Wee'ld fight there too. But this it is, our Foote
2742   Vpon the hilles adioyning to the Citty
2743   Shall stay with vs. Order for Sea is giuen,
2744   They haue put forth the Hauen:
2745   Where their appointment we may best discouer,
2746   And looke on their endeuour.  <D {exeunt}>
2747   <D {Enter Caesar, and his Army}.>
2748   <S {Caes}.> But being charg'd, we will be still by Land,
2749   Which as I tak't we shall, for his best force
2750   Is forth to Man his Gallies. To the Vales,
2751   And hold our best aduantage.  <D {exeunt}.>
2752   <D {Alarum afarre off, as at a Sea- fight}.
2753   {Enter Anthony, and Scarrus}.>
2754   <S {Ant}.> Yet they are not ioyn'd:
2755   Where yon'd Pine does stand, I shall discouer all.
2756   Ile bring thee word straight, how 'tis like to go.  <D {exit}.>
2757   <S {Scar}.> Swallowes haue built
2758   In {Cleopatra's} Sailes their nests. The Auguries
2759   Say, they know not, they cannot tell, looke grimly,
2760   And dare not speake their knowledge. {Anthony},
2761   Is valiant, and deiected, and by starts
2762   His fretted Fortunes giue him hope and feare
2763   Of what he has, and has not.
2764   <D {Enter Anthony}.>
2765   <S {Ant}.> All is lost:
2766   This fowle Egyptian hath betrayed me:
2767   My Fleete hath yeelded to the Foe, and yonder
2768   They cast their Caps vp, and Carowse together
2769   Like Friends long lost. Triple- turn'd Whore, 'tis thou
2770   Hast sold me to this Nouice, and my heart
2771   Makes onely Warres on thee. Bid them all flye:
2772   For when I am reueng'd vpon my Charme,
2773   I haue done all. Bid them all flye, be gone.
2774   Oh Sunne, thy vprise shall I see no more,
2775   Fortune, and {Anthony} part heere, euen heere
2776   Do we shake hands? All come to this? The hearts
2777   That pannelled me at heeles, to whom I gaue
2778   Their wishes, do dis- Candie, melt their sweets
2779   On blossoming {Caesar}: And this Pine is barkt,
2780   That ouer- top'd them all. Betray'd I am.
2781   Oh this false Soule of Egypt! this graue Charme,
2782   Whose eye beck'd forth my Wars, & cal'd them home:
2783   Whose Bosome was my Crownet, my chiefe end,
2784   Like a right Gypsie, hath at fast and loose
2785   Beguil'd me, to the very heart of losse.
2786   What {Eros}, {Eros}?
2787   <D {Enter Cleopatra}.>
2788   Ah, thou Spell! Auaunt.
2789   <S {Cleo}.> Why is my Lord enrag'd against his Loue?
2790   <S {Ant}.> Vanish, or I shall giue thee thy deseruing,
2791   And blemish {Caesars} Triumph. Let him take thee,
2792   And hoist thee vp to the shouting Plebeians,
2793   Follow his Chariot, like the greatest spot
2794   Of all thy Sex. Most Monster- like be shewne
2795   For poor'st Diminitiues, for Dolts, and let
2796   Patient {Octauia}, plough thy visage vp
2797   With her prepared nailes.  <D {exit Cleopatra}.>
2798   'Tis well th'art gone,
2799   If it be well to liue. But better 'twere
2800   Thou fell'st into my furie, for one death
2801   Might haue preuented many. {Eros}, hoa!
2802   The shirt of {Nessus} is vpon me, teach me
2803   {Alcides}, thou mine Ancestor, thy rage.
2804   Let me lodge {Licas} on the hornes o'th' Moone,
2805   And with those hands that graspt the heauiest Club,
2806   Subdue my worthiest selfe: The Witch shall die,
2807   To the young Roman Boy she hath sold me, and I fall
2808   Vnder this plot: She dyes for't. {Eros} hoa?  <D {exit}.>
2809   <D {Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, Mardian}.>
2810   <S {Cleo}.> Helpe me my women: Oh hee's more mad
2811   Then {Telamon} for his Shield, the Boare of Thessaly
2812   Was neuer so imbost.
2813   <S {Char}.> To'th' Monument, there locke your selfe,
2814   And send him word you are dead:
      <P yy5v>
2815   The Soule and Body riue not more in parting,
2816   Then greatnesse going off.
2817   <S {Cleo}.> To'th' Monument:
2818   {Mardian}, go tell him I haue slaine my selfe:
2819   Say, that the last I spoke was {Anthony},
2820   And word it (prythee) pitteously. Hence {Mardian},
2821   And bring me how he takes my death to'th' Monument.
2822   <D {Exeunt}.>
2823   <D {Enter Anthony, and Eros}.>
2824   <S {Ant}.> {Eros}, thou yet behold'st me?
2825   <S {Eros}.> #I Noble Lord.
2826   <S {Ant}.> Sometime we see a clowd that's Dragonish,
2827   A vapour sometime, like a Beare, or Lyon,
2828   A toward Cittadell, a pendant Rocke,
2829   A forked Mountaine, or blew Promontorie
2830   With Trees vpon't, that nodde vnto the world,
2831   And mocke our eyes with Ayre.
2832   Thou hast seene these Signes,
2833   They are blacke Vespers Pageants.
2834   <S {Eros}.> #I my Lord.
2835  *<S {Ant}.> That which is now a Horse, euen with a thoght
2836   the Racke dislimes, and makes it indistinct
2837   As water is in water.
2838   <S {Eros}.> It does my Lord.
2839   <S {Ant}.> My good Knaue {Eros}, now thy Captaine is
2840   Euen such a body: Heere I am {Anthony},
2841   Yet cannot hold this visible shape (my Knaue)
2842   I made these warres for Egypt, and the Queene,
2843   Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine:
2844   Which whil'st it was mine, had annext vntoo't
2845   A Million moe, (now lost:) shee {Eros} has
2846   Packt Cards with {Caesars}, and false plaid my Glory
2847   Vnto an Enemies triumph.
2848   Nay, weepe not gentle {Eros}, there is left vs
2849   Our selues to end our selues.
2850   <D {Enter Mardian}.>
2851   Oh thy vilde Lady, she has rob'd me of my Sword.
2852   <S {Mar}.> No {Anthony},
2853   My Mistris lou'd thee, and her Fortunes mingled
2854   with thine intirely.
2855  *<S {Ant}.> Hence sawcy Eunuch peace, she hath betraid me,
2856   And shall dye the death.
2857   <S {Mar}.> Death of one person, can be paide but once,
2858   And that she ha's discharg'd. What thou would'st do
2859   Is done vnto thy hand: the last she spake
2860   Was {Anthony}, most Noble {Anthony}.
2861   Then in the midd'st a tearing grone did breake
2862   The name of {Anthony}: it was diuided
2863   Betweene her heart, and lips: she tendred life
2864   Thy name so buried in her.
2865   <S {Ant}.> Dead then?
2866   <S {Mar}.> Dead.
2867   <S {Ant}.> Vnarme {Eros}, the long dayes taske is done,
2868   And we must sleepe: That thou depart'st hence safe
2869   Does pay thy labour richly: Go.  <D {exit Mardian}.>
2870   Off, plucke off,
2871   The seuen- fold shield of {Aiax} cannot keepe
2872   The battery from my heart. Oh cleaue my sides.
2873   Heart, once be stronger then thy Continent,
2874   Cracke thy fraile Case. Apace {Eros}, apace;
2875   No more a Soldier: bruised peeces go,
2876  *You haue bin Nobly borne. From me awhile.  <D {exit Eros}>
2877   I will o're- take thee {Cleopatra}, and
2878   Weepe for my pardon. So it must be, for now
2879   All length is Torture: since the Torch is out,
2880   Lye downe and stray no farther. Now all labour
2881   Marres what it does: yea, very force entangles
2882   It selfe with strength: Seale then and all is done.
2883   {Eros}? I come my Queene. {Eros}? Stay for me,
2884  *Where Soules do couch on Flowers, wee'l hand in hand,
2885   And with our sprightly Port make the Ghostes gaze:
2886   {Dido}, and her {Aeneas} shall want Troopes,
2887   And all the haunt be ours. Come {Eros}, {Eros}.
2888   <D {Enter Eros}.>
2889   <S {Eros}.> What would my Lord?
2890   <S {Ant}.> Since {Cleopatra} dyed,
2891   I haue liu'd in such dishonour, that the Gods
2892   Detest my basenesse. I, that with my Sword,
2893   Quarter'd the World, and o're greene Neptunes backe
2894   With Ships, made Cities; condemne my selfe, to lacke
2895   The Courage of a Woman, lesse Noble minde
2896   Then she which by her death, our {Caesar} telles
2897   I am Conqueror of my selfe. Thou art sworne {Eros},
2898   That when the exigent should come, which now
2899   Is come indeed: When I should see behinde me
2900   Th' ineuitable prosecution of disgrace and horror,
2901   That on my command, thou then would'st kill me.
2902   Doo't, the time is come: Thou strik'st not me,
2903   'Tis {Caesar} thou defeat'st. Put colour in thy Cheeke.
2904   <S {Eros}.> The Gods with- hold me,
2905   Shall I do that which all the Parthian Darts,
2906   (Though Enemy) lost ayme, and could not.
2907   <S {Ant}.> {Eros},
2908   Would'st thou be window'd in great Rome, and see
2909   Thy Master thus with pleacht Armes, bending downe
2910   His corrigible necke, his face subdu'de
2911   To penetratiue shame; whil'st the wheel'd seate
2912   Of Fortunate {Caesar} drawne before him, branded
2913   His Basenesse that ensued.
2914   <S {Eros}.> I would not see't.
2915  *<S {Ant}.> Come then: for with a wound I must be cur'd.
2916   Draw that thy honest Sword, which thou hast worne
2917   Most vsefull for thy Country.
2918   <S {Eros}.> Oh sir, pardon me.
2919  *<S {Ant}.> When I did make thee free, swor'st y not then
2920   To do this when I bad thee? Do it at once,
2921   Or thy precedent Seruices are all
2922   But accidents vnpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
2923   <S {Eros}.> Turne from me then that Noble countenance,
2924   Wherein the worship of the whole world lyes.
2925   <S {Ant}.> Loe thee.
2926   <S {Eros}.> My sword is drawne.
2927   <S {Ant}.> Then let it do at once
2928   The thing why thou hast drawne it.
2929   <S {Eros}.> My deere Master,
2930   My Captaine, and my Emperor. Let me say
2931   Before I strike this bloody stroke, Farwell.
2932   <S {Ant}.> 'Tis said man, and farewell.
2933   <S {Eros}.> Farewell great Chiefe. Shall I strike now?
2934   <S {Ant}.> Now {Eros}.  <D {Killes himselfe}.>
2935   <S {Eros}.> Why there then:
2936   Thus I do escape the sorrow of {Anthonies} death.
2937   <S {Ant}.> Thrice- Nobler then my selfe,
2938   Thou teachest me: Oh valiant {Eros}, what
2939   I should, and thou could'st not, my Queene and {Eros}
2940   Haue by their braue instruction got vpon me
2941   A Noblenesse in Record. But I will bee
2942   A Bride- groome in my death, and run intoo't
2943   As to a Louers bed. Come then, and {Eros},
2944   Thy Master dies thy Scholler; to do thus
2945   I learnt of thee. How, not dead? Not dead?
2946   The Guard, how? Oh dispatch me.
      <P yy6>
2947   <D {Enter a Guard}.>
2948   <S 1.{Guard}.> What's the noise?
2949   <S {Ant}.> I haue done my worke #ill Friends:
2950   Oh make an end of what I haue begun.
2951   <S 2> The Starre is falne.
2952   <S 1> And time is at his Period.
2953   <S {All}.> Alas, and woe.
2954   <S {Ant}.> Let him that loues me, strike me dead.
2955   <S 1> Not I.
2956   <S 2> Nor I.
2957   <S 3> Nor any one.  <D {exeunt}>
2958  *<S {Decretus}.> Thy death and fortunes bid thy folowers fly
2959   This sword but shewne to {Caesar} with this tydings,
2960   Shall enter me with him.
2961   <D {Enter Diomedes}.>
2962   <S {Dio}.> Where's {Anthony}?
2963   <S {Decre}.> There {Diomed} there.
2964   <S {Diom}.> Liues he: wilt thou not answer man?
2965   <S {Ant}.> Art thou there {Diomed}?
2966   Draw thy sword, and giue mee,
2967   Suffising strokes for death.
2968   <S {Diom}.> Most absolute Lord:
2969   My Mistris {Cleopatra} sent me to thee.
2970   <S {Ant}.> When did shee send thee?
2971   <S {Diom}.> Now my Lord.
2972   <S {Anth}.> Where is she?
2973  *<S {Diom}.> Lockt in her Monument: she had a Prophesying |(feare
2974   Of what hath come to passe: for when she saw
2975   (Which neuer shall be found) you did suspect
2976   She had dispos'd with {Caesar}, and that your rage
2977  *Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead:
2978   But fearing since how it might worke, hath sent
2979   Me to proclaime the truth, and I am come
2980   I dread, too late.
2981  *<S {Ant}.> Too late good {Diomed}: call my Guard I prythee.
2982   <S {Dio}.> What hoa: the Emperors Guard,
2983   The Guard, what hoa? Come, your Lord calles.
2984   <D {Enter} 4. {or} 5. {of the Guard of Anthony}.>
2985   <S {Ant}.> Beare me good Friends where {Cleopatra} bides,
2986   'Tis the last seruice that I shall command you.
2987   <S 1> Woe, woe are we sir, you may not liue to weare
2988   All your true Followers out.
2989   <S {All}.> Most heauy day.
2990  *<S {Ant}.> Nay good my Fellowes, do not please sharp fate
2991   To grace it with your sorrowes. Bid that welcome
2992   Which comes to punish vs, and we punish it
2993   Seeming to beare it lightly. Take me vp,
2994   I haue led you oft, carry me now good Friends,
2995   And haue my thankes for all.  <D {Exit bearing Anthony}>
2996   <D {Enter Cleopatra, and her Maides aloft, with}
2997   {Charmian & Iras}.>
2998   <S {Cleo}.> Oh {Charmian}, I will neuer go from hence.
2999   <S {Char}.> Be comforted deere Madam.
3000   <S {Cleo}.> No, I will not:
3001   All strange and terrible euents are welcome,
3002   But comforts we dispise; our size of sorrow
3003   Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
3004   As that which makes it.
3005   <D {Enter Diomed}.>
3006   How now? is he dead?
3007   <S {Diom}.> His death's vpon him, but not dead.
3008   Looke out o'th other side your Monument,
3009   His Guard haue brought him thither.
3010   <D {Enter Anthony, and the Guard}.>
3011   <S {Cleo}.> Oh Sunne,
3012   Burne the great Sphere thou mou'st in, darkling stand
3013  *The varrying shore o'th' world. O {Antony, Antony, Antony}
3014   Helpe {Charmian}, helpe {Iras} helpe: helpe Friends
3015   Below, let's draw him hither.
3016   <S {Ant}.> Peace,
3017   Not {Caesars} Valour hath o'rethrowne {Anthony},
3018   But {Anthonie's} hath Triumpht on it selfe.
3019   <S {Cleo}.> So it should be,
3020   That none but {Anthony} should conquer {Anthony},
3021   But woe 'tis so.
3022   <S {Ant}.> I am dying Egypt, dying; onely
3023   I heere importune death a- while, vntill
3024   Of many thousand kisses, the poore last
3025   I lay vpon thy lippes.
3026   <S {Cleo}.> I dare not Deere,
3027   Deere my Lord pardon: I dare not,
3028   Least I be taken: nor th' Imperious shew
3029   Of the full- Fortun'd {Caesar}, euer shall
3030   Be brooch'd with me, if Knife, Drugges, Serpents haue
3031   Edge, sting, or operation. I am safe:
3032   Your Wife {Octauia}, with her modest eyes,
3033   And still Conclusion, shall acquire no Honour
3034   Demuring vpon me: but come, come {Anthony},
3035   Helpe me my women, we must draw thee vp:
3036   Assist good Friends.
3037   <S {Ant}.> Oh quicke, or I am gone.
3038   <S {Cleo}.> Heere's sport indeede:
3039   How heauy weighes my Lord?
3040   Our strength is all gone into heauinesse,
3041   That makes the waight. Had I great {Iuno's} power,
3042   The strong wing'd Mercury should fetch thee vp,
3043   And set thee by Ioues side. Yet come a little,
3044   Wishers were euer Fooles. Oh come, come, come,
3045   <D {They heaue Anthony aloft to Cleopatra}.>
3046   And welcome, welcome. Dye when thou hast liu'd,
3047   Quicken with kissing: had my lippes that power,
3048   Thus would I weare them out.
3049   <S {All}.> #A heauy sight.
3050   <S {Ant}.> I am dying Egypt, dying.
3051   Giue me some Wine, and let me speake a little.
3052   <S {Cleo}.> No, let me speake, and let me rayle so hye,
3053   That the false Huswife Fortune, breake her Wheele,
3054   Prouok'd by my offence.
3055   <S {Ant}.> One word (sweet Queene)
3056   Of {Caesar} seeke your Honour, with your safety. Oh.
3057   <S {Cleo}.> They do not go together.
3058   <S {Ant}.> Gentle heare me,
3059   None about {Caesar} trust, but {Proculeius}.
3060   <S {Cleo}.> My Resolution, and my hands, Ile trust,
3061   None about {Caesar}.
3062   <S {Ant}.> The miserable change now at my end,
3063   Lament nor sorrow at: but please your thoughts
3064   In feeding them with those my former Fortunes
3065   Wherein I liued. The greatest Prince o'th' world,
3066   The Noblest: and do now not basely dye,
3067   Not Cowardly put off my Helmet to
3068   My Countreyman. A Roman, by a Roman
3069   Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my Spirit is going,
3070   I can no more.
3071   <S {Cleo}.> Noblest of men, woo't dye?
3072   Hast thou no care of me, shall I abide
3073   In this dull world, which in thy absence is
3074   No better then a Stye? Oh see my women:
3075   The Crowne o'th' earth doth melt. My Lord?
3076   Oh wither'd is the Garland of the Warre,
      <P yy6v>
3077   The Souldiers pole is falne: young Boyes and Gyrles
3078   Are leuell now with men: The oddes is gone,
3079   And there is nothing left remarkeable
3080   Beneath the visiting Moone.
3081   <S {Char}.> Oh quietnesse, Lady.
3082   <S {Iras}.> She's dead too, our Soueraigne.
3083   <S {Char}.> Lady.
3084   <S {Iras}.> Madam.
3085   <S {Char}.> Oh Madam, Madam, Madam.
3086   <S {Iras}.> Royall Egypt: Empresse.
3087   <S {Char}.> Peace, peace, {Iras}.
3088   <S {Cleo}.> No more but in a Woman, and commanded
3089   By such poore passion, as the Maid that Milkes,
3090   And doe's the meanest chares. It were for me,
3091   To throw my Scepter at the iniurious Gods,
3092   To tell them that this World did equall theyrs,
3093   Till they had stolne our Iewell. All's but naught:
3094   Patience is sortish, and impatience does
3095   Become a Dogge that's mad: Then is it sinne,
3096   To rush into the secret house of death,
3097   Ere death dare come to vs. How do you Women?
3098   What, what good cheere? Why how now {Charmian}?
3099   My Noble Gyrles? Ah Women, women! Looke
3100   Our Lampe is spent, it's out. Good sirs, take heart,
3101   Wee'l bury him: And then, what's braue, what's Noble,
3102   Let's doo't after the high Roman fashion,
3103   And make death proud to take vs. Come, away,
3104   This case of that huge Spirit now is cold.
3105   Ah Women, Women! Come, we haue no Friend
3106   But Resolution, and the breefest end.
3107   <D {Exeunt, bearing #of Anthonies body}.>
3108   <D {Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Dollabella, Menas, with}
3109   {his Counsell of Warre}.>
3110   <S {Caesar}.> Go to him {Dollabella}, bid him yeeld,
3111   Being so frustrate, tell him,
3112   He mockes the pawses that he makes.
3113   <S {Dol}.> {Caesar}, I shall.
3114   <D {Enter Decretas with the sword of Anthony}.>
3115  *<S {Caes}.> Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
3116   Appeare thus to vs?
3117   <S {Dec}.> I am call'd {Decretas},
3118   {Marke Anthony} I seru'd, who best was worthie
3119   Best to be seru'd: whil'st he stood vp, and spoke
3120   He was my Master, and I wore my life
3121   To spend vpon his haters. If thou please
3122   To take me to thee, as I was to him,
3123   Ile be to {Caesar}: if y pleasest not, I yeild thee vp my life.
3124   <S {Caesar}.> What is't thou say'st?
3125   <S {Dec}.> I say (Oh {Caesar}) {Anthony} is dead.
3126  *<S {Caesar}.> The breaking of so great a thing, should make
3127   A greater cracke. The round World
3128   Should haue shooke Lyons into ciuill streets,
3129   And Cittizens to their dennes. The death of {Anthony}
3130   Is not a single doome, in the name lay
3131   A moity of the world.
3132   <S {Dec}.> He is dead {Caesar},
3133   Not by a publike minister of Iustice,
3134   Nor by a hyred Knife, but that selfe- hand
3135   Which writ his Honor in the Acts it did,
3136   Hath with the Courage which the heart did lend it,
3137   Splitted the heart. This is his Sword,
3138   I robb'd his wound of it: behold it stain'd
3139   With his most Noble blood.
3140   <S {Caes}.> Looke you sad Friends,
3141   The Gods rebuke me, but it is Tydings
3142   To wash the eyes of Kings.
3143   <S {Dol}.> And strange it is,
3144   That Nature must compell vs to lament
3145   Our most persisted deeds.
3146  *<S {Mec}.> His taints and Honours, wag'd equal with him.
3147   <S {Dola}.> A Rarer spirit neuer
3148   Did steere humanity: but you Gods will giue vs
3149   Some faults to make vs men. {Caesar} is touch'd.
3150  *<S {Mec}.> When such a spacious Mirror's set before him,
3151   He needes must see him selfe.
3152   <S {Caesar}.> Oh {Anthony},
3153   I haue followed thee to this, but we do launch
3154   Diseases in our Bodies. I must perforce
3155   Haue shewne to thee such a declining day,
3156   Or looke on thine: we could not stall together,
3157   In the whole world. But yet let me lament
3158   With teares as Soueraigne as the blood of hearts,
3159   That thou my Brother, my Competitor,
3160   In top of all designe; my Mate in Empire,
3161   Friend and Companion in the front of Warre,
3162   The Arme of mine owne Body, and the Heart
3163   Where mine his thoughts did kindle; that our Starres
3164   Vnreconciliable, should diuide our equalnesse to this.
3165   Heare me good Friends,
3166   But I will tell you at some meeter Season,
3167   The businesse of this man lookes out of him,
3168   Wee'l heare him what he sayes.
3169   <D {Enter an Aegyptian}.>
3170   Whence are you?
3171  *<S {Aegyp}.> A poore Egyptian yet, the Queen my mistris
3172   Confin'd in all, she has her Monument
3173   Of thy intents, desires, instruction,
3174   That she preparedly may frame her selfe
3175   To'th' way shee's forc'd #too.
3176   <S {Caesar}.> Bid her haue good heart,
3177   She soone shall know of vs, by some of ours,
3178   How honourable, and how kindely Wee
3179  *Determine for her. For {Caesar} cannot leaue to be vngentle
3180   <S {Aegypt}.> So the Gods preserue thee. <D {Exit}.>
3181   <S {Caes}.> Come hither {Proculeius}. Go and say
3182   We purpose her no shame: giue her what comforts
3183   The quality of her passion shall require;
3184   Least in her greatnesse, by some mortall stroke
3185   She do defeate vs. For her life in Rome,
3186   Would be eternall in our Triumph: Go,
3187   And with your speediest bring vs what she sayes,
3188   And how you finde of her.
3189   <S {Pro}.> {Caesar} I shall.  <D {Exit Proculeius}.>
3190  *<S {Caes}.> {Gallus}, go you along: where's {Dolabella}, to se-cond
3191   {Proculeius}?
3192   <S {All}.> {Dolabella}.
3193   <S {Caes}.> Let him alone: for I remember now
3194   How hee's imployd: he shall in time be ready.
3195   Go with me to my Tent, where you shall see
3196   How hardly I was drawne into this Warre,
3197   How calme and gentle I proceeded still
3198   In all my Writings. Go with me, and see
3199   What I can shew in this.  <D {Exeunt}.>
3200   <D {Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian}.>
3201   <S {Cleo}.> My desolation does begin to make
3202   A better life: Tis paltry to be {Caesar}:
3203   Not being Fortune, hee's but Fortunes knaue,
3204   A minister of her #will: and it is great
      <P zz1>
3205   To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
3206   Which shackles accedents, and bolts vp change;
3207   Which sleepes, and neuer pallates more the dung,
3208   The beggers Nurse, and {Caesars}.
3209   <D {Enter Proculeius}.>
3210   <S {Pro}.> {Caesar} sends greeting to the Queene of Egypt,
3211   And bids thee study on what faire demands
3212   Thou mean'st to haue him grant thee.
3213   <S {Cleo}.> What's thy name?
3214   <S {Pro}.> My name is {Proculeius}.
3215   <S {Cleo}.> {Anthony}
3216   Did tell me of you, bad me trust you, but
3217   I do not greatly care to be deceiu'd
3218   That haue no vse for trusting. If your Master
3219   Would haue a Queene his begger, you must tell him,
3220   That Maiesty to keepe {decorum}, must
3221   No lesse begge then a Kingdome: If he please
3222   To giue me conquer'd Egypt for my Sonne,
3223   He giues me so much of mine owne, as I
3224   Will kneele to him with thankes.
3225   <S {Pro}.> Be of good cheere:
3226   Y'are falne into a Princely hand, feare nothing,
3227   Make your full reference freely to my Lord,
3228   Who is so full of Grace, that it flowes ouer
3229   On all that neede. Let me report to him
3230   Your sweet dependancie, and you shall finde
3231   A Conqueror that will pray in ayde for kindnesse,
3232   Where he for grace is kneel'd #too.
3233   <S {Cleo}.> Pray you tell him,
3234   I am his Fortunes Vassall, and I send him
3235   The Greatnesse he has got. I hourely learne
3236   A Doctrine of Obedience, and would gladly
3237   Looke him i'th' Face.
3238   <S {Pro}.> This Ile report (deere Lady)
3239   Haue comfort, for I know your plight is pittied
3240   Of him that caus'd it.
3241   <S {Pro}.> You see how easily she may be surpriz'd:
3242   Guard her till {Caesar} come.
3243   <S {Iras}.> Royall Queene.
3244   <S {Char}.> Oh {Cleopatra}, thou art taken Queene.
3245   <S {Cleo}.> Quicke, quicke, good hands.
3246   <S {Pro}.> Hold worthy Lady, hold:
3247   Doe not your selfe such wrong, who are in this
3248   Releeu'd, but not betraid.
3249  *<S {Cleo}.> What of death too that rids our dogs of languish
3250  *<S {Pro}.>  {Cleopatra}, do not abuse my Masters bounty, by
3251   Th' vndoing of your selfe: Let the World see
3252   His Noblenesse well acted, which your death
3253   Will neuer let come forth.
3254   <S {Cleo}.> Where art thou Death?
3255   Come hither come; Come, come, and take a Queene
3256   Worth many Babes and Beggers.
3257   <S {Pro}.> Oh temperance Lady.
3258   <S {Cleo}.> Sir, I will eate no meate, Ile not drinke sir,
3259   If idle talke will once be necessary
3260   Ile not sleepe neither. This mortall house Ile ruine,
3261   Do {Caesar} what he can. Know sir, that I
3262   Will not waite pinnion'd at your Masters Court,
3263   Nor once be chastic'd with the sober eye
3264   Of dull {Octauia}. Shall they hoyst me vp,
3265   And shew me to the showting Varlotarie
3266   Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt.
3267   Be gentle graue vnto me, rather on Nylus mudde
3268   Lay me starke- nak'd, and let the water- Flies
3269   Blow me into abhorring; rather make
3270   My Countries high pyramides my Gibbet,
3271   And hang me vp in Chaines.
3272   <S {Pro}.> You do extend
3273   These thoughts of horror further then you shall
3274   Finde cause in {Caesar}.
3275   <D {Enter Dolabella}.>
3276   <S {Dol}.> {Proculeius},
3277   What thou hast done, thy Master {Caesar} knowes,
3278   And he hath sent for thee: for the Queene,
3279   Ile take her to my Guard.
3280   <S {Pro}.> So {Dolabella},
3281   It shall content me best: Be gentle to her,
3282   To {Caesar} I will speake, what you shall please,
3283   If you'l imploy me to him.  <D {Exit Proculeius}>
3284   <S {Cleo}.> Say, I would dye.
3285   <S {Dol}.> Most Noble Empresse, you haue heard of me.
3286   <S {Cleo}.> I cannot tell.
3287   <S {Dol}.> Assuredly you know me.
3288   <S {Cleo}.> No matter sir, what I haue heard or knowne:
3289   You laugh when Boyes or Women tell their Dreames,
3290   Is't not your tricke?
3291   <S {Dol}.> I vnderstand not, Madam.
3292   <S {Cleo}.> I dreampt there was an Emperor {Anthony}.
3293   Oh such another sleepe, that I might see
3294   But such another man.
3295   <S {Dol}.> If it might please ye.
3296   <S {Cleo}.> His face was as the Heau'ns, and therein stucke
3297  *A Sunne and Moone, which kept their course, & lighted
3298   The little o'th' earth.
3299   <S {Dol}.> Most Soueraigne Creature.
3300   <S {Cleo}.> His legges bestrid the Ocean, his rear'd arme
3301   Crested the world: His voyce was propertied
3302   As all the tuned Spheres, and that to Friends:
3303   But when he meant to quaile, and shake the Orbe,
3304   He was as ratling Thunder. For his Bounty,
3305   There was no winter in't. An {Anthony} it was,
3306   That grew the more by reaping: His delights
3307   Were Dolphin- like, they shew'd his backe aboue
3308   The Element they liu'd in: In his Liuery
3309  *Walk'd Crownes and Crownets: Realms & Islands were
3310   As plates dropt from his pocket.
3311   <S {Dol}.> {Cleopatra}.
3312   <S {Cleo}.> Thinke you there was, or might be such a man
3313   As this I dreampt of?
3314   <S {Dol}.> Gentle Madam, no.
3315   <S {Cleo}.> You Lye vp to the hearing of the Gods:
3316   But if there be, not euer were one such
3317   It's past the size of dreaming: Nature wants stuffe
3318   To vie strange formes with fancie, yet t' imagine
3319   An {Anthony} were Natures peece, 'gainst Fancie,
3320   Condemning shadowes quite.
3321   <S {Dol}.> Heare me, good Madam:
3322   Your losse is as your selfe, great; and you beare it
3323   As answering to the waight, would I might neuer
3324   Ore- take pursu'de successe: But I do feele
3325   By the rebound of yours, a greefe that suites
3326   My very heart at roote.
3327   <S {Cleo}.> I thanke you sir:
3328   Know you what {Caesar} meanes to do with me?
3329  *<S {Dol}.> I am loath to tell you what, I would you knew.
3330   <S {Cleo}.> Nay pray you sir.
3331   <S {Dol}.> Though he be Honourable.
3332   <S {Cleo}.> Hee'l leade me then in Triumph.
3333   <S {Dol}.> Madam he will, I know't.  <D {Flourish}.>
3334   <D {Enter Proculeius, Caesar, Gallus, Mecenas},
3335   {and others of his Traine}.>
3336   <S {All}.> Make way there {Caesar}.
      <P zz1v>
3337   <S {Caes}.> Which is the Queene of Egypt.
3338   <S {Dol}.> It is the Emperor Madam.  <D {Cleo. kneeles}.>
3339   <S {Caesar}.> Arise, you shall not kneele:
3340   I pray you rise, rise Egypt.
3341   <S {Cleo}.> Sir, the Gods will haue it thus,
3342   My Master and my Lord I must obey,
3343   <S {Caesar}.> Take to you no hard thoughts,
3344   The Record of what iniuries you did vs,
3345   Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
3346   As things but done by chance.
3347   <S {Cleo}.> Sole #Sir o'th' World,
3348   I cannot proiect mine owne cause so well
3349   To make it cleare, but do confesse I haue
3350   Bene laden with like frailties, which before
3351   Haue often sham'd our Sex.
3352   <S {Caesar}.> {Cleopatra} know,
3353   We will extenuate rather then inforce:
3354   If you apply your selfe to our intents,
3355   Which towards you are most gentle, you shall finde
3356   A benefit in this change: but if you seeke
3357   To lay on me a Cruelty, by taking
3358   {Anthonies} course, you shall bereaue your selfe
3359   Of my good purposes, and put your children
3360   To that destruction which Ile guard them from,
3361   If thereon you relye. Ile take my leaue.
3362  *<S {Cleo}.> And may through all the world: tis yours, & we
3363   your Scutcheons, and your signes of Conquest shall
3364   Hang in what place you please. Here my good Lord.
3365   <S {Caesar}.> You shall aduise me in all for {Cleopatra}.
3366   <S {Cleo}.> This is the breefe: of Money, Plate, & Iewels
3367   I am possest of, 'tis exactly valewed,
3368   Not petty things admitted. Where's {Seleucus}?
3369   <S {Seleu}.> Heere Madam.
3370  *<S {Cleo}.> This is my Treasurer, let him speake (my Lord)
3371   Vpon his perill, that I haue reseru'd
3372   To my selfe nothing. Speake the truth {Seleucus}.
3373   <S {Seleu}.> Madam, I had rather seele my lippes,
3374   Then to my perill speake that which is not.
3375   <S {Cleo}.> What haue I kept backe.
3376  *<S {Sel}.> Enough to purchase what you haue made known
3377   <S {Caesar}.> Nay blush not {Cleopatra}, I approue
3378   Your Wisedome in the deede.
3379   <S {Cleo}.> See {Caesar}: Oh behold,
3380   How pompe is followed: Mine will now be yours,
3381   And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
3382   The ingratitude of this {Seleucus}, does
3383   Euen make me wilde. Oh Slaue, of no more trust
3384   Then loue that's hyr'd? What goest thou backe, y shalt
3385   Go backe I warrant thee: but Ile catch thine eyes
3386  *Though they had wings. Slaue, Soule- lesse, Villain, Dog.
3387   O rarely base!
3388   <S {Caesar}.> Good Queene, let vs intreat you.
3389   <S {Cleo}.> O {Caesar}, what a wounding shame is this,
3390   That thou vouchsafing heere to visit me,
3391   Doing the Honour of thy Lordlinesse
3392   To one so meeke, that mine owne Seruant should
3393   Parcell the summe of my disgraces, by
3394   Addition of his Enuy. Say (good {Caesar})
3395   That I some Lady trifles haue reseru'd,
3396   Immoment toyes, things of such Dignitie
3397   As we greet moderne Friends withall, and say
3398   Some Nobler token I haue kept apart
3399   For {Liuia} and {Octauia}, to induce
3400   Their mediation, must I be vnfolded
3401   With one that I haue bred: The Gods! it smites me
3402   Beneath the fall I haue. Prythee go hence,
3403   Or I shall shew the Cynders of my spirits
3404   Through th' Ashes of my chance: Wer't thou a man,
3405   Thou would'st haue mercy on me.
3406   <S {Caesar}.> Forbeare {Seleucus}.
3407  *<S {Cleo}.> Be it known, that we the greatest are mis- thoght
3408   For things that others do: and when we fall,
3409   We answer others merits, in our name
3410   Are therefore to be pittied.
3411   <S {Caesar}.> {Cleopatra},
3412   Not what you haue reseru'd, nor what acknowledg'd
3413   Put we i'th' Roll of Conquest: still bee't yours,
3414   Bestow it at your pleasure, and beleeue
3415   {Caesar}s no Merchant, to make prize with you
3416   Of things that Merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd,
3417  *Make not your thoughts your prisons: No deere Queen,
3418   For we intend so to dispose you, as
3419   Your selfe shall giue vs counsell: Feede, and sleepe:
3420   Our care and pitty is so much vpon you,
3421   That we remaine your Friend, and so adieu.
3422   <S {Cleo}.> My Master, and my Lord.
3423   <S {Caesar}.> Not so: Adieu.  <D {Flourish}.
3424   {Exeunt Caesar, and his Traine}.>
3425   <S {Cleo}.> He words me Gyrles, he words me,
3426   That I should not be Noble to my selfe.
3427   But hearke thee {Charmian}.
3428   <S {Iras}.> Finish good Lady, the bright day is done,
3429   And we are for the darke.
3430   <S {Cleo}.> Hye thee againe,
3431   I haue spoke already, and it is prouided,
3432   Go put it to the haste.
3433   <S {Char}.> Madam, I will.
3434   <D {Enter Dolabella}.>
3435   <S {Dol}.> Where's the Queene?
3436   <S {Char}.> Behold sir.
3437   <S {Cleo}.> {Dolabella}.
3438   <S {Dol}.> Madam, as thereto sworne, by your command
3439   (Which my loue makes Religion to obey)
3440   I tell you this: {Caesar} through Syria
3441   Intends his iourney, and within three dayes,
3442   You with your Children will he send before,
3443   Make your best vse of this. I haue perform'd
3444   Your pleasure, and my promise.
3445   <S {Cleo}.> {Dolabella}, I shall remaine your debter.
3446   <S {Dol}.> I your Seruant:
3447   Adieu good Queene, I must attend on {Caesar}.  <D {Exit}>
3448   <S {Cleo}.> Farewell, and thankes.
3449   Now {Iras}, what think'st thou?
3450   Thou, an Egyptian Puppet shall be shewne
3451   In Rome aswell as I: Mechanicke Slaues
3452   With greazie Aprons, Rules, and Hammers shall
3453   Vplift vs to the view. In their thicke breathes,
3454   Ranke of grosse dyet, shall we be enclowded,
3455   And forc'd to drinke their vapour.
3456   <S {Iras}.> The Gods forbid.
3457   <S {Cleo}.> Nay, 'tis most certaine {Iras}: sawcie Lictors
3458   Will catch at vs like Strumpets, and scald Rimers
3459   Ballads vs out #a Tune. The quicke Comedians
3460   Extemporally will stage vs, and present
3461   Our Alexandrian Reuels: {Anthony}
3462   Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
3463   Some squeaking {Cleopatra} Boy my greatnesse
3464   I'th' posture of a Whore.
3465   <S {Iras}.> O the good Gods!
3466   <S {Cleo}.> Nay that's certaine.
3467   <S {Iras}.> Ile neuer see't? for I am sure mine Nailes
3468   Are stronger then mine eyes.
      <P zz2>
3469  *<S {Cleo}.> Why that's the way to foole their preparation,
3470   And to conquer their most absurd intents.
3471   <D {Enter Charmian}.>
3472   Now {Charmian}.
3473   Shew me my Women like a Queene: Go fetch
3474   My best Attyres. I am againe for {Cidrus},
3475   To meete {Marke Anthony}. Sirra {Iras}, go
3476   (Now Noble {Charmian}, wee'l dispatch indeede,)
3477   And when thou hast done this chare, Ile giue thee leaue
3478   To play till Doomesday: bring our Crowne, and all.
3479   <D {A noise within}.>
3480   Wherefore's this noise?
3481   <D {Enter a Guardsman}.>
3482   <S {Gards}.> Heere is a rurall Fellow,
3483   That will not be deny'de your Highnesse presence,
3484   He brings you Figges.
3485   <S {Cleo}.> Let him come in.  <D {Exit Guardsman}.>
3486   What poore an Instrument
3487   May do a Noble deede: he brings me liberty:
3488   My Resolution's plac'd, and I haue nothing
3489   Of woman in me: Now from head to foote
3490   I am Marble constant: now the fleeting Moone
3491   No Planet is of mine.
3492   <D {Enter Guardsman, and Clowne}.>
3493   <S {Guards}.> This is the man.
3494   <S {Cleo}.> Auoid, and leaue him.  <D {Exit Guardsman}.>
3495   Hast thou the pretty worme of Nylus there,
3496   That killes and paines not?
3497  *<S {Clow}.> Truly I haue him: but I would not be the par-tie
3498  *that should desire you to touch him, for his byting is
3499  *immortall: those that doe dye of it, doe seldome or ne-uer
3500   recouer.
3501   <S {Cleo}.> Remember'st thou any that haue dyed on't?
3502  *<S {Clow}.> Very many, men and women too. I heard of
3503  *one of them no longer then yesterday, a very honest wo-man,
3504  *but something giuen to lye, as a woman should not
3505  *do, but in the way of honesty, how she dyed of the by-ting
3506  *of it, what paine she felt: Truely, she makes a verie
3507  *good report o'th' worme: but he that wil beleeue all that
3508  *they say, shall neuer be saued by halfe that they do: but
3509   this is most falliable, the Worme's an odde Worme.
3510   <S {Cleo}.> Get thee hence, farewell.
3511   <S {Clow}.> I wish you all ioy of the Worme.
3512   <S {Cleo}.> Farewell.
3513   <S {Clow}.> You must thinke this (looke you,) that the
3514   Worme will do his kinde.
3515   <S {Cleo}.> #I, #I, farewell.
3516  *<S {Clow}.> Looke you, the Worme is not to bee trusted,
3517  *but in the keeping of wise people: for indeede, there is
3518   no goodnesse in the Worme.
3519   <S {Cleo}.> Take thou no care, it shall be heeded.
3520  *<S {Clow}.> Very good: giue it nothing I pray you, for it
3521   is not worth the feeding.
3522   <S {Cleo}.> Will it eate me?
3523  *<S {Clow}.> You must not think I am so simple, but I know
3524  *the diuell himselfe will not eate a woman: I know, that
3525  *a woman is a dish for the Gods, if the diuell dresse her
3526  *not. But truly, these same whorson diuels doe the Gods
3527  *great harme in their women: for in euery tenne that they
3528   make, the diuels marre fiue.
3529   <S {Cleo}.> Well, get thee gone, farewell.
3530  *<S {Clow}.> Yes forsooth: I wish you ioy o'th' worm.  <D {Exit}>
3531   <S {Cleo}.> Giue me my Robe, put on my Crowne, I haue
3532   Immortall longings in me. Now no more
3533   The iuyce of Egypts Grape shall moyst this lip.
3534   #Yare, #yare, good {Iras}; quicke: Me thinkes I heare
3535   {Anthony} call: I see him rowse himselfe
3536   To praise my Noble Act. I heare him mock
3537   The lucke of {Caesar}, which the Gods giue men
3538   To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come:
3539   Now to that name, my Courage proue my Title.
3540   I am Fire, and Ayre; my other Elements
3541   I giue to baser life. So, haue you done?
3542   Come then, and take the last warmth of my Lippes.
3543   Farewell kinde {Charmian}, {Iras}, long farewell.
3544   Haue I the Aspicke in my lippes? Dost fall?
3545   If thou, and Nature can so gently part,
3546   The stroke of death is as a Louers pinch,
3547   Which hurts, and is desir'd. Dost thou lye still?
3548   If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world,
3549   It is not worth leaue- taking.
3550  *<S {Char}.> Dissolue thicke clowd, & Raine, that I may say
3551   The Gods themselues do weepe.
3552   <S {Cleo}.> This proues me base:
3553   If she first meete the Curled {Anthony},
3554   Hee'l make demand of her, and spend that kisse
3555  *Which is my heauen to haue. Come thou mortal wretch,
3556   With thy sharpe teeth this knot intrinsicate,
3557   Of life at once vntye: Poore venomous Foole,
3558   Be angry, and dispatch. Oh could'st thou speake,
3559  *That I might heare thee call great {Caesar} Asse, vnpolicied.
3560   <S {Char}.> Oh Easterne Starre.
3561   <S {Cleo}.> Peace, peace:
3562   Dost thou not see my Baby at my breast,
3563   That suckes the Nurse asleepe.
3564   <S {Char}.> O breake! O breake!
3565   <S {Cleo}.> As sweet as Balme, as soft as Ayre, as gentle.
3566   O {Anthony}! Nay I will take thee too.
3567   What should I stay===  <D {Dyes}.>
3568   <S {Char}.> In this wilde World? So fare thee well:
3569   Now boast thee Death, in thy possession lyes
3570   A Lasse vnparalell'd. Downie Windowes cloze,
3571   And golden Phoebus, neuer be beheld
3572   Of eyes againe so Royall: your Crownes away,
3573   Ile mend it, and then play===
3574   <D {Enter the Guard rustling in; and Dolabella}.>
3575   <S 1.{Guard}.> Where's the Queene?
3576   <S {Char}.> Speake softly, wake her not.
3577   <S 1> {Caesar} hath sent
3578   <S {Char}.> Too slow a Messenger.
3579   Oh come apace, dispatch, I partly feele thee.
3580   <S 1> Approach hoa,
3581   All's not well: {Caesar}'s beguild.
3582   <S 2> There's {Dolabella} sent from {Caesar}: call him.
3583   <S 1> What worke is heere {Charmian}?
3584   Is this well done?
3585   <S {Char}.> It is well done, and fitting for a Princesse
3586   Descended of so many Royall Kings.
3587   Ah Souldier.  <D {Charmian dyes}.>
3588   <D {Enter Dolabella}.>
3589   <S {Dol}.> How goes it heere?
3590   <S 2.{Guard}.> All dead.
3591   <S {Dol}.> {Caesar}, thy thoughts
3592   Touch their effects in this: Thy selfe art comming
3593   To see perform'd the dreaded Act which thou
3594   So sought'st to hinder.
3595   <D {Enter Caesar and all his Traine, marching}.>
3596   <S {All}.> A way there, a way for {Caesar}.
      <P zz2v>
3597   <S {Dol}.> Oh sir, you are too sure an Augurer:
3598   That you did feare, is done.
3599   <S {Caesar}.> Brauest at the last,
3600   She leuell'd at our purposes, and being Royall
3601   Tooke her owne way: the manner of their deaths,
3602   I do not see them bleede.
3603   <S {Dol}.> Who was last with them?
3604  *<S 1.{Guard}.> A simple Countryman, that broght hir Figs:
3605   This was his Basket.
3606   <S {Caesar}.> Poyson'd then.
3607   <S 1.{Guard}.> Oh {Caesar}:
3608   This {Charmian} liu'd but now, she stood and spake:
3609   I found her trimming vp the Diadem;
3610   On her dead Mistris tremblingly she stood,
3611   And on the sodaine dropt.
3612   <S {Caesar}.> Oh Noble weakenesse:
3613   If they had swallow'd poyson, 'twould appeare
3614   By externall swelling: but she lookes like sleepe,
3615   As she would catch another {Anthony}
3616   In her strong toyle of Grace.
3617   <S {Dol}.> Heere on her brest,
3618   There is a vent of Bloud, and something blowne,
3619   The like is on her Arme.
3620   <S 1.{Guard}.> This is an Aspickes traile,
3621   And these Figge- leaues haue slime vpon them, such
3622   As th' Aspicke leaues vpon the Caues of Nyle.
3623   <S {Caesar}.> Most probable
3624   That so she dyed: for her Physitian tels mee
3625   She hath pursu'de Conclusions infinite
3626   Of easie wayes to dye. Take vp her bed,
3627   And beare her Women from the Monument,
3628   She shall be buried by her {Anthony}.
3629   No Graue vpon the earth shall clip in it
3630   A payre so famous: high euents as these
3631   Strike those that make them: and their Story is
3632   No lesse in pitty, then his Glory which
3633   Brought them to be lamented. Our Army shall
3634   In solemne shew, attend this Funerall,
3635   And then to Rome. Come {Dolabella}, see
3636   High Order, in this great Solemnity.  <D {Exeunt omnes}>
