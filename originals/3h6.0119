3      <D {Enter Plantagenet, Edward, Richard, Norfolke, Mount-ague},
4      {Warwicke, and Souldiers}.>
5      <S {Warwicke}.>
6      I Wonder how the King escap'd our hands?
7     *<S {Pl}.> While we pursu'd the Horsmen of y North,
8      He slyly stole away, and left his men:
9      Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
10     Whose Warlike eares could neuer brooke retreat,
11     Chear'd vp the drouping Army, and himselfe.
12     Lord {Clifford} and Lord {Stafford} all a- brest
13     Charg'd our maine Battailes Front: and breaking in,
14     Were by the Swords of common Souldiers slaine.
15     <S {Edw}.> Lord {Staffords} Father, Duke of {Buckingham},
16     Is either slaine or wounded dangerous.
17     I cleft his Beauer with a down- right blow:
18     That this is true (Father) behold his blood.
19     <S {Mount}.> And Brother, here's the Earle of Wiltshires |(blood,
20     Whom I encountred as the Battels ioyn'd.
21     <S {Rich}.> Speake thou for me, and tell them what I did.
22     <S {Plan}.> {Richard} hath best deseru'd of all my sonnes:
23     But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
24     <S {Nor}.> Such hope haue all the line of {Iohn of Gaunt}.
25     <S {Rich}.> Thus do I hope to shake King {Henries} head.
26     <S {Warw}.> And so doe I, victorious Prince of {Yorke}.
27     Before I see thee seated in that Throne,
28     Which now the House of {Lancaster} vsurpes,
29     I vow by Heauen, these eyes shall neuer close.
30     This is the Pallace of the fearefull King,
31     And this the Regall Seat: possesse it {Yorke},
32     For this is thine, and not King {Henries} Heires.
33     <S {Plant}.> Assist me then, sweet {Warwick}, and I will,
34     For hither we haue broken in by force.
35     <S {Norf}.> Wee'le all assist you: he that flyes, shall dye.
36     <S {Plant}.> Thankes gentle {Norfolke}, stay by me my Lords,
37     And Souldiers stay and lodge by me this Night.
38     <D {They goe vp}.>
39    *<S {Warw}.> And when the King comes, offer him no violence,
40     Vnlesse he seeke to thrust you out perforce.
41     <S {Plant}.> The Queene this day here holds her Parliament,
42     But little thinkes we shall be of her counsaile,
43     By words or blowes here let vs winne our right.
44     <S {Rich}.> Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this House.
45     <S {Warw}.> The bloody Parliament shall this be call'd,
46     Vnlesse {Plantagenet}, Duke of Yorke, be King,
47     And bashfull {Henry} depos'd, whose Cowardize
48     Hath made vs by- words to our enemies.
49     <S {Plant}.> Then leaue me not, my Lords be resolute,
50     I meane to take possession of my Right.
51     <S {Warw}.> Neither the King, nor he that loues him best,
52     The prowdest #hee that holds vp {Lancaster},
53     Dares stirre a Wing, if {Warwick} shake his Bells.
54     Ile plant {Plantagenet}, root him vp who dares:
55     Resolue thee {Richard}, clayme the English Crowne.
56     <D {Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland},
57     {Westmerland, Exeter, and the rest}.>
58    *<S {Henry}.> My Lords, looke where the sturdie Rebell sits,
59     Euen in the Chayre of State: belike he meanes,
60     Backt by the power of {Warwicke}, that false Peere,
61     To aspire vnto the Crowne, and reigne as King.
62     Earle of Northumberland, he slew thy Father,
63    *And thine, Lord {Clifford}, & you both haue vow'd reuenge
64     On him, his sonnes, his fauorites, and his friends.
65     <S {Northumb}.> If I be not, Heauens be reueng'd on me.
66    *<S {Clifford}.> The hope thereof, makes {Clifford} mourne in
67     Steele.
68    *<S {Westm}.> What, shall we suffer this? lets pluck him down,
69     My heart for anger burnes, I cannot brooke it.
70     <S {Henry}.> Be patient, gentle Earle of Westmerland.
71     <S {Clifford}.> Patience is for Poultroones, such as he:
72     He durst not sit there, had your Father liu'd.
73     My gracious Lord, here in the Parliament
74     Let vs assayle the Family of {Yorke}.
75     <S {North}.> Well hast thou spoken, Cousin be it so.
76     <S {Henry}.> Ah, know you not the Citie fauours them,
77     And they haue troupes of Souldiers at their beck?
78    *<S {Westm}.> But when the Duke is slaine, they'le quickly
79     flye.
80    *<S {Henry}.> Farre be the thought of this from {Henries} heart,
81     To make a Shambles of the Parliament House.
82     Cousin of Exeter, frownes, words, and threats,
83     Shall be the Warre that {Henry} meanes to vse.
84     Thou factious Duke of Yorke descend my Throne,
85     And kneele for grace and mercie at my feet,
86     I am thy Soueraigne.
87     <S {Yorke}.> I am thine.
88    *<S {Exet}.> For shame come downe, he made thee Duke of
89     Yorke.
90     <S {Yorke}.> It was my Inheritance, as the Earledome was.
      <P o4v>
91     <S {Exet}.> Thy Father was a Traytor to the Crowne.
92     <S {Warw}.> {Exeter} thou art a Traytor to the Crowne,
93     In following this vsurping {Henry}.
94    *<S {Clifford}.> Whom should hee follow, but his naturall
95     King?
96     <S {Warw}.> True {Clifford}, that's {Richard} Duke of Yorke.
97     <S {Henry}.> And shall I stand, and thou sit in my Throne?
98     <S {Yorke}.> It must and shall be so, content thy selfe.
99     <S {Warw}.> Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.
100    <S {Westm}.> He is both King, and Duke of Lancaster,
101    And that the Lord of Westmerland shall maintaine.
102    <S {Warw}.> And {Warwick} shall disproue it. You forget,
103    That we are those which chas'd you from the field,
104    And slew your Fathers, and with Colours spread
105    Marcht through the Citie to the Pallace Gates.
106    <S {Northumb}.> Yes {Warwicke}, I remember it to my griefe,
107    And by his Soule, thou and thy House shall rue it.
108    <S {Westm}.> {Plantagenet}, of thee and these thy Sonnes,
109    Thy Kinsmen, and thy Friends, Ile haue more liues
110    Then drops of bloud were in my Fathers Veines.
111    <S {Cliff}.> Vrge it no more, lest that in stead of words,
112    I send thee, {Warwicke}, such a Messenger,
113    As shall reuenge his death, before I stirre.
114   *<S {Warw}.> Poore {Clifford}, how I scorne his worthlesse
115    Threats.
116    <S {Plant}.> Will you we shew our Title to the Crowne?
117    If not, our Swords shall pleade it in the field.
118   *<S {Henry}.> What Title hast thou Traytor to the Crowne?
119    My Father was as thou art, Duke of Yorke,
120    Thy Grandfather {Roger Mortimer}, Earle of March.
121    I am the Sonne of {Henry} the Fift,
122    Who made the Dolphin and the French to stoupe,
123    And seiz'd vpon their Townes and Prouinces.
124    <S {Warw}.> Talke not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
125    <S {Henry}.> The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
126    When I was crown'd, I was but nine moneths old.
127    <S {Rich}.> You are old enough now,
128    And yet me thinkes you loose:
129    Father teare the Crowne from the Vsurpers Head.
130    <S {Edward}.> Sweet Father doe so, set it on your Head.
131    <S {Mount}.> Good Brother,
132    As thou lou'st and honorest Armes,
133    Let's fight it out, and not stand cauilling thus.
134   *<S {Richard}.> Sound Drummes and Trumpets, and the
135    King will flye.
136    <S {Plant}.> Sonnes peace.
137   *<S {Henry}.> Peace thou, and giue King {Henry} leaue to
138    speake.
139   *<S {Warw}.> {Plantagenet} shal speake first: Heare him Lords,
140    And be you silent and attentiue too,
141    For he that interrupts him, shall not liue.
142   *<S {Hen}.> Think'st thou, that I will leaue my Kingly Throne,
143    Wherein my Grandsire and my Father sat?
144    No: first shall Warre vnpeople this my Realme;
145    #I, and their Colours often borne in France,
146    And now in England, to our hearts great sorrow,
147    Shall be my Winding- sheet. Why faint you Lords?
148    My Title's good, and better farre then his.
149    <S {Warw}.> Proue it {Henry}, and thou shalt be King.
150   *<S {Hen}.> {Henry} the Fourth by Conquest got the Crowne.
151    <S {Plant}.> 'Twas by Rebellion against his King.
152    <S {Henry}.> I know not what to say, my Titles weake:
153    Tell me, may not a King adopt an Heire?
154    <S {Plant}.> What then?
155    <S {Henry}.> #And if he may, then am I lawfull King:
156    For {Richard}, in the view of many Lords,
157    Resign'd the Crowne to {Henry} the Fourth,
158    Whose Heire my Father was, and I am his.
159    <S {Plant}.> He rose against him, being his Soueraigne,
160    And made him to resigne his Crowne perforce.
161    <S {Warw}.> Suppose, my Lords, he did it vnconstrayn'd,
162    Thinke you 'twere preiudiciall to his Crowne?
163    <S {Exet}.> No: for he could not so resigne his Crowne,
164    But that the next Heire should succeed and reigne.
165    <S {Henry}.> Art thou against vs, Duke of Exeter?
166    <S {Exet}.> His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
167    <S {Plant}.> Why whisper you, my Lords, and answer not?
168    <S {Exet}.> My Conscience tells me he is lawfull King.
169    <S {Henry}.> All will reuolt from me, and turne to him.
170    <S {Northumb}.> {Plantagenet}, for all the Clayme thou lay'st,
171    Thinke not, that {Henry} shall be so depos'd.
172    <S {Warw}.> Depos'd he shall be, in despight of all.
173    <S {Northumb}.> Thou art deceiu'd:
174    'Tis not thy Southerne power
175    Of Essex, Norfolke, Suffolke, nor of Kent,
176    Which makes thee thus presumptuous and prowd,
177    Can set the Duke vp in despight of me.
178    <S {Clifford}.> King {Henry}, be thy Title right or wrong,
179    Lord {Clifford} vowes to fight in thy defence:
180    May that ground gape, and swallow me aliue,
181    Where I shall kneele to him that slew my Father.
182    <S {Henry}.> Oh {Clifford}, how thy words reuiue my heart.
183    <S {Plant}.> {Henry} of Lancaster, resigne thy Crowne:
184    What mutter you, or what conspire you Lords?
185    <S {Warw}.> Doe right vnto this Princely Duke of Yorke,
186    Or I will fill the House with armed men,
187    And ouer the Chayre of State, where now he sits,
188    Write vp his Title with vsurping blood.
189    <D {He stampes with his foot, and the Souldiers}
190    {shew themselues}.>
191    <S {Henry}.> My Lord of Warwick, heare but one word,
192    Let me for this my life time reigne as King.
193   *<S {Plant}.> Confirme the Crowne to me and to mine Heires,
194    And thou shalt reigne in quiet while thou liu'st.
195    <S {Henry}.> I am content: {Richard Plantagenet}
196    Enioy the Kingdome after my decease.
197   *<S {Clifford}.> What wrong is this vnto the Prince, your
198    Sonne?
199    <S {Warw}.> What good is this to England, and himselfe?
200    <S {Westm}.> Base, fearefull, and despayring {Henry}.
201    <S {Clifford}.> How hast thou iniur'd both thy selfe and vs?
202    <S {Westm}.> I cannot stay to heare these Articles.
203    <S {Northumb}.> Nor I.
204   *<S {Clifford}.> Come Cousin, let vs tell the Queene these
205    Newes.
206    <S {Westm}.> Farwell faint- hearted and degenerate King,
207    In whose cold blood no sparke of Honor bides.
208    <S {Northumb}.> Be thou a prey vnto the House of {Yorke},
209    And dye in Bands, for this vnmanly deed.
210    <S {Cliff}.> In dreadfull Warre may'st thou be ouercome,
211    Or liue in peace abandon'd and despis'd.
212    <S {Warw}.> Turne this way {Henry}, and regard them not.
213   *<S {Exeter}.> They seeke reuenge, and therefore will not
214    yeeld?
215    <S {Henry}.> Ah {Exeter}.
216    <S {Warw}.> Why should you sigh, my Lord?
217   *<S {Henry}.> Not for my selfe Lord {Warwick}, but my Sonne,
218    Whom I vnnaturally shall dis- inherite.
219    But be it as it may: I here entayle
220    The Crowne to thee and to thine Heires for euer,
221    Conditionally, that heere thou take an Oath,
222    To cease this Ciuill Warre: and whil'st I liue,
      <P o5>
223    To honor me as thy King, and Soueraigne:
224    And neyther by Treason nor Hostilitie,
225    To seeke to put me downe, and reigne thy selfe.
226    <S {Plant}.> This Oath I willingly take, and will performe.
227   *<S {Warw}.> Long liue King {Henry}: {Plantagenet} embrace
228    him.
229   *<S {Henry}.> And long liue thou, and these thy forward
230    Sonnes.
231    <S {Plant}.> Now {Yorke} and {Lancaster} are reconcil'd.
232    <S {Exet}.> Accurst be he that seekes to make them foes.
233    <D {Senet. Here they come downe}.>
234    <S {Plant}.> Farewell my gracious Lord, Ile to my Castle.
235    <S {Warw}.> And Ile keepe London with my Souldiers.
236    <S {Norf}.> And I to Norfolke with my followers.
237    <S {Mount}.> And I vnto the Sea, from whence I came.
238    <S {Henry}.> And I with griefe and sorrow to the Court.
239    <D {Enter the Queene}.>
240    <S {Exeter}.> Heere comes the Queene,
241    Whose Lookes bewray her anger:
242    Ile steale away.
243    <S {Henry}.> {Exeter} so will I.
244    <S {Queene}.> Nay, goe not from me, I will follow thee.
245    <S {Henry}.> Be patient gentle Queene, and I will stay.
246    <S {Queene}.> Who can be patient in such extreames?
247    Ah wretched man, would I had dy'de a Maid?
248    And neuer seene thee, neuer borne thee Sonne,
249    Seeing thou hast prou'd so vnnaturall a Father.
250    Hath he deseru'd to loose his Birth- right thus?
251    Hadst thou but lou'd him halfe so well as I,
252    Or felt that paine which I did for him once,
253    Or nourisht him, as I did with my blood;
254    Thou would'st haue left thy dearest heart- blood there,
255    Rather then haue made that sauage Duke thine Heire,
256    And dis- inherited thine onely Sonne.
257    <S {Prince}.> Father, you cannot dis- inherite me:
258    If you be King, why should not I succeede?
259   *<S {Henry}.> Pardon me {Margaret}, pardon me sweet Sonne,
260    The Earle of Warwick and the Duke enforc't me.
261   *<S {Quee}.> Enforc't thee? Art thou King, and wilt be forc't?
262    I shame to heare thee speake: ah timorous Wretch,
263    Thou hast vndone thy selfe, thy Sonne, and me,
264    And giu'n vnto the House of {Yorke} such head,
265    As thou shalt reigne but by their sufferance.
266    To entayle him and his Heires vnto the Crowne,
267    What is it, but to make thy Sepulcher,
268    And creepe into it farre before thy time?
269    {Warwick} is Chancelor, and the Lord of Callice,
270    Sterne {Falconbridge} commands the Narrow Seas,
271    The Duke is made Protector of the Realme,
272    And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safetie findes
273    The trembling Lambe, inuironned with Wolues.
274    Had I beene there, which am a silly Woman,
275    The Souldiers should haue toss'd me on their Pikes,
276    Before I would haue granted to that Act.
277    But thou preferr'st thy Life, before thine Honor.
278    And seeing thou do'st, I here diuorce my selfe,
279    Both from thy Table {Henry}, and thy Bed,
280    Vntill that Act of Parliament be repeal'd,
281    Whereby my Sonne is dis- inherited.
282   *The Northerne Lords, that haue forsworne thy Colours,
283    Will follow mine, if once they see them spread:
284    And spread they shall be, to thy foule disgrace,
285    And vtter ruine of the House of {Yorke}.
286    Thus doe I leaue thee: Come Sonne, let's away,
287    Our Army is ready; come, wee'le after them.
288    <S {Henry}.> Stay gentle {Margaret}, and heare me speake.
289   *<S {Queene}.> Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee
290    gone.
291    <S {Henry}.> Gentle Sonne {Edward}, thou wilt stay me?
292    <S {Queene}.> #I, to be murther'd by his Enemies.
293    <S {Prince}.> When I returne with victorie to the field,
294    Ile see your Grace: till then, Ile follow her.
295    <S {Queene}.> Come Sonne away, we may not linger thus.
296    <S {Henry}.> Poore Queene,
297    How loue to me, and to her Sonne,
298    Hath made her breake out into termes of Rage.
299    Reueng'd may she be on that hatefull Duke,
300    Whose haughtie spirit, winged with desire,
301    Will cost my Crowne, and like an emptie Eagle,
302    Tyre on the flesh of me, and of my Sonne.
303    The losse of those three Lords torments my heart:
304    Ile write vnto them, and entreat them faire;
305    Come Cousin, you shall be the Messenger.
306    <S {Exet}.> And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.  <D {Exit}.>
307    <D {Flourish. Enter Richard, Edward, and}
308    {Mountague}.>
309   *<S {Richard}.> Brother, though I bee youngest, giue mee
310    leaue.
311    <S {Edward}.> No, I can better play the Orator.
312    <S {Mount}.> But I haue reasons strong and forceable.
313    <D {Enter the Duke of Yorke}.>
314   *<S {Yorke}.> Why how now Sonnes, and Brother, at a strife?
315    What is your Quarrell? how began it first?
316    <S {Edward}.> No Quarrell, but a slight Contention.
317    <S {Yorke}.> About what?
318   *<S {Rich}.> About that which concernes your Grace and vs,
319    The Crowne of England, Father, which is yours.
320    <S {Yorke}.> Mine Boy? not till King {Henry} be dead.
321   *<S {Richard}.> Your Right depends not on his life, or death.
322    <S {Edward}.> Now you are Heire, therefore enioy it now:
323    By giuing the House of {Lancaster} leaue to breathe,
324    It will out- runne you, Father, in the end.
325   *<S {Yorke}.> I tooke an Oath, that hee should quietly
326    reigne.
327   *<S {Edward}.> But for a Kingdome any Oath may be broken:
328    I would breake a thousand Oathes, to reigne one yeere.
329   *<S {Richard}.> No: God forbid your Grace should be for-sworne.
330   _
331    <S {Yorke}.> I shall be, if I clayme by open Warre.
332   *<S {Richard}.> Ile proue the contrary, if you'le heare mee
333    speake.
334    <S {Yorke}.> Thou canst not, Sonne: it is impossible.
335    <S {Richard}.> An Oath is of no moment, being not tooke
336    Before a true and lawfull Magistrate,
337    That hath authoritie ouer him that sweares.
338    {#Henry} had none, but did vsurpe the place.
339    Then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
340    Your Oath, my Lord, is vaine and friuolous.
341    Therefore to Armes: and Father doe but thinke,
342    How sweet a thing it is to weare a Crowne,
343    Within whose Circuit is {Elizium},
344    And all that Poets faine of Blisse and Ioy.
345    Why doe we linger thus? I cannot rest,
346    Vntill the White Rose that I weare, be dy'de
347    Euen in the luke- warme blood of {Henries} heart.
348    <S {Yorke}.> {Richard} ynough: I will be King, or dye.
349    Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
350    And whet on {Warwick} to this Enterprise.
      <P o5v>
351    Thou {Richard} shalt to the Duke of Norfolke,
352    And tell him priuily of our intent.
353    You {Edward} shall vnto my Lord {Cobham},
354    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise.
355    In them I trust: for they are Souldiors,
356    Wittie, courteous, liberall, full of spirit.
357    While you are thus imploy'd, what resteth more?
358    But that I seeke occasion how to rise,
359    And yet the King not priuie to my Drift,
360    Nor any of the House of {Lancaster}.
361    <D {Enter Gabriel}.>
362   *But stay, what Newes? Why comm'st thou in such
363    poste?
364    <S {Gabriel}.> The Queene,
365    With all the Northerne Earles and Lords,
366    Intend here to besiege you in your Castle.
367    She is hard by, with twentie thousand men:
368    And therefore fortifie your Hold, my Lord.
369    <S {Yorke}.> #I, with my Sword.
370    What? think'st thou, that we feare them?
371    {#Edward} and {Richard}, you shall stay with me,
372    My Brother {Mountague} shall poste to London.
373    Let Noble {Warwicke}, {Cobham}, and the rest,
374    Whom we haue left Protectors of the King,
375    With powrefull Pollicie strengthen themselues,
376    And trust not simple {Henry}, nor his Oathes.
377    <S {Mount}.> Brother, I goe: Ile winne them, feare it not.
378    And thus most humbly I doe take my leaue.
379    <D {Exit Mountague}.>
380    <D {Enter Mortimer, and his Brother}.>
381    <S {York}.> Sir {Iohn}, and Sir {Hugh Mortimer}, mine Vnckles,
382    You are come to Sandall in a happie houre.
383    The Armie of the Queene meane to besiege vs.
384   *<S {Iohn}.> Shee shall not neede, wee'le meete her in the
385    field.
386    <S {Yorke}.> What, with fiue thousand men?
387    <S {Richard}.> #I, with fiue hundred, Father, for a neede.
388    A Woman's generall: what should we feare?
389    <D {A March afarre off}.>
390    <S {Edward}.> I heare their Drummes:
391    Let's set our men in order,
392    And issue forth, and bid them Battaile straight.
393   *<S {Yorke}.> Fiue men to twentie: though the oddes be great,
394    I doubt not, Vnckle, of our Victorie.
395    Many a Battaile haue I wonne in France,
396    When as the Enemie hath beene tenne to one:
397    Why should I not now haue the like successe?
398    <D {Alarum. Exit}.>
399    <D {Enter Rutland, and his Tutor}.>
400   *<S {Rutland}.> Ah, whither shall I flye, to scape their hands?
401    Ah Tutor, looke where bloody {Clifford} comes.
402    <D {Enter Clifford}.>
403   *<S {Clifford}.> Chaplaine away, thy Priesthood saues thy life.
404    As for the Brat of this accursed Duke,
405    Whose Father slew my Father, he shall dye.
406    <S {Tutor}.> And I, my Lord, will beare him company.
407    <S {Clifford}.> Souldiers, away with him.
408    <S {Tutor}.> Ah {Clifford}, murther not this innocent Child,
409    Least thou be hated both of God and Man.  <D {Exit}.>
410    <S {Clifford}.> How now? is he dead alreadie?
411    Or is it feare, that makes him close his eyes?
412    Ile open them.
413   *<S {Rutland}.> So looks the pent- vp Lyon o're the Wretch,
414    That trembles vnder his deuouring Pawes:
415    And so he walkes, insulting o're his Prey,
416    And so he comes, to rend his Limbes asunder.
417    Ah gentle {Clifford}, kill me with thy Sword,
418    And not with such a cruell threatning Looke.
419    Sweet {Clifford} heare me speake, before I dye:
420    I am too meane a subiect for thy Wrath,
421    Be thou reueng'd on men, and let me liue.
422    <S {Clifford}.> In vaine thou speak'st, poore Boy:
423    My Fathers blood hath stopt the passage
424    Where thy words should enter.
425    <S {Rutland}.> Then let my Fathers blood open it againe,
426    He is a man, and {Clifford} cope with him.
427   *<S {Clifford}.> Had I thy Brethren here, their liues and thine
428    Were not reuenge sufficient for me:
429    No, if I digg'd vp thy fore- fathers Graues,
430    And hung their rotten Coffins vp in Chaynes,
431    It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
432    The sight of any of the House of {Yorke},
433    Is as a furie to torment my Soule:
434    And till I root out their accursed Line,
435    And leaue not one aliue, I liue in #Hell.
436    Therefore===
437    <S {Rutland}.> Oh let me pray, before I take my death:
438    To thee I pray; sweet {Clifford} pitty me.
439    <S {Clifford}.> Such pitty as my Rapiers point affords.
440   *<S {Rutland}.> I neuer did thee harme: why wilt thou slay
441    me?
442    <S {Clifford}.> Thy Father hath.
443    <S {Rutland}.> But 'twas ere I was borne.
444    Thou hast one Sonne, for his sake pitty me,
445    Least in reuenge thereof, sith God is iust,
446    He be as miserably slaine as I.
447    Ah, let me liue in Prison all my dayes,
448    And when I giue occasion of offence,
449    Then let me dye, for now thou hast no cause.
450   *<S {Clifford}.> No cause? thy Father slew my Father: there-fore
451    dye.
452    <S {Rutland}.> {Dij faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae}.
453    <S {Clifford}.> {Plantagenet}, I come {Plantagenet}:
454    And this thy Sonnes blood cleauing to my Blade,
455    Shall rust vpon my Weapon, till thy blood
456    Congeal'd with this, doe make me wipe off both.  <D {Exit}.>
457    <D {Alarum. Enter Richard, Duke of Yorke}.>
458    <S {Yorke}.> The Army of the Queene hath got the field:
459    My Vnckles both are slaine, in rescuing me;
460    And all my followers, to the eager foe
461    Turne back, and flye, like Ships before the Winde,
462    Or Lambes pursu'd by hunger- starued Wolues.
463    My Sonnes, God knowes what hath bechanced them:
464    But this I know, they haue demean'd themselues
465    Like men borne to Renowne, by Life or Death.
466    Three times did {Richard} make a Lane to me,
467    And thrice cry'de, Courage Father, fight it out:
468    And full as oft came {Edward} to my side,
469    With Purple Faulchion, painted to the Hilt,
470    In blood of those that had encountred him:
471    And when the hardyest Warriors did retyre,
472    {#Richard} cry'de, Charge, and giue no foot of ground,
473    And cry'de, A Crowne, or else a glorious Tombe,
      <P o6>
474    A Scepter, or an Earthly Sepulchre.
475    With this we charg'd againe: but out alas,
476    We bodg'd againe, as I haue seene a Swan
477    With bootlesse labour swimme against the Tyde,
478    And spend her strength with ouer- matching Waues.
479    <D {A short Alarum within}.>
480    Ah hearke, the fatall followers doe pursue,
481    And I am faint, and cannot flye their furie:
482    And were I strong, I would not shunne their furie,
483    The Sands are numbred, that makes vp my Life,
484    Here must I stay, and here my Life must end.
485    <D {Enter the Queene, Clifford, Northumberland},
486    {the young Prince, and Souldiers}.>
487    Come bloody {Clifford}, rough {Northumberland},
488    I dare your quenchlesse furie to more rage:
489    I am your Butt, and I abide your Shot.
490    <S {Northumb}.> Yeeld to our mercy, proud {Plantagenet}.
491    <S {Clifford}.> #I, to such mercy, as his ruthlesse Arme
492    With downe- right payment, shew'd vnto my Father.
493    Now {Phaeton} hath tumbled from his Carre,
494    And made an Euening at the Noone- tide Prick.
495    <S {Yorke}.> My ashes, as the Phoenix, may bring forth
496    A Bird, that will reuenge vpon you all:
497    And in that hope, I throw mine eyes to Heauen,
498    Scorning what ere you can afflict me with.
499    Why come you not? what, multitudes, and feare?
500   *<S {Cliff}.> So Cowards fight, when they can flye no further,
501    So Doues doe peck the Faulcons piercing Tallons,
502    So desperate Theeues, all hopelesse of their Liues,
503    Breathe out Inuectiues 'gainst the Officers.
504    <S {Yorke}.> Oh {Clifford}, but bethinke thee once againe,
505    And in thy thought ore- run my former time:
506    And if thou canst, for blushing, view this face,
507   *And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with Cowardice,
508    Whose frowne hath made thee faint and flye ere this.
509    <S {Clifford}.> I will not bandie with thee word for word,
510    But buckler with thee blowes twice two for one.
511    <S {Queene}.> Hold valiant {Clifford}, for a thousand causes
512    I would prolong #a while the Traytors Life:
513    Wrath makes him deafe; speake thou {Northumberland}.
514    <S {Northumb}.> Hold {Clifford}, doe not honor him so much,
515    To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.
516    What valour were it, when a Curre doth grinne,
517    For one to thrust his Hand betweene his Teeth,
518    When he might spurne him with his Foot away?
519    It is Warres prize, to take all Vantages,
520    And tenne to one, is no impeach of Valour.
521   *<S {Clifford}.> #I, #I, so striues the Woodcocke with the
522    Gynne.
523   *<S {Northumb}.> So doth the Connie struggle in the
524    Net.
525   *<S {York}.> So triumph Theeues vpon their conquer'd Booty,
526    So True men yeeld with Robbers, so o're- matcht.
527   *<S {Northumb}.> What would your Grace haue done vnto
528    him now?
529   *<S {Queene}.> Braue Warriors, {Clifford} and {Northumberland},
530    Come make him stand vpon this Mole- hill here,
531    That raught at Mountaines with out- stretched Armes,
532    Yet parted but the shadow with his Hand.
533    What, was it you that would be Englands King?
534    #Was't you that reuell'd in our Parliament,
535    And made a Preachment of your high Descent?
536    Where are your Messe of Sonnes, to back you now?
537    The wanton {Edward}, and the lustie {George}?
538    And where's that valiant Crook- back Prodigie,
539    {Dickie}, your Boy, that with his grumbling voyce
540    Was wont to cheare his Dad in Mutinies?
541    Or with the rest, where is your Darling, {Rutland}?
542    Looke {Yorke}, I stayn'd this Napkin with the blood
543    That valiant {Clifford}, with his Rapiers point,
544    Made issue from the Bosome of the Boy:
545    And if thine eyes can water for his death,
546    I giue thee this to drie thy Cheekes withall.
547    Alas poore {Yorke}, but that I hate thee deadly,
548    I should lament thy miserable state.
549    I prythee grieue, to make me merry, {Yorke}.
550    What, hath thy fierie heart so parcht thine entrayles,
551    That not a Teare can fall, for {Rutlands} death?
552    Why art thou patient, man? thou should'st be mad:
553    And I, to make thee mad, doe mock thee thus.
554    Stampe, raue, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
555    Thou would'st be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
556    {#Yorke} cannot speake, vnlesse he weare a Crowne.
557    A Crowne for {Yorke}; and Lords, bow lowe to him:
558    Hold you his hands, whilest I doe set it on.
559    #I marry Sir, now lookes he like a King:
560    #I, this is he that tooke King {Henries} Chaire,
561    And this is he was his adopted Heire.
562    But how is it, that great {Plantagenet}
563    Is crown'd so soone, and broke his solemne Oath?
564    As I bethinke me, you should not be King,
565    Till our King {Henry} had shooke hands with Death.
566    And will you pale your head in {Henries} Glory,
567    And rob his Temples of the Diademe,
568    Now in his Life, against your holy Oath?
569    Oh 'tis a fault too too vnpardonable.
570    Off with the Crowne; and with the Crowne, his Head,
571    And whilest we breathe, take time to doe him dead.
572    <S {Clifford}.> That is my Office, for my Fathers sake.
573   *<S {Queene}.> Nay stay, let's heare the Orizons hee
574    makes.
575    <S {Yorke}.> Shee- Wolfe of France,
576    But worse then Wolues of France,
577    Whose Tongue more poysons then the Adders Tooth:
578    How ill- beseeming is it in thy Sex,
579    To triumph like an Amazonian Trull,
580    Vpon their Woes, whom Fortune captiuates?
581    But that thy Face is Vizard- like, vnchanging,
582    Made impudent with vse of euill deedes.
583    I would assay, prowd Queene, to make thee blush.
584    To tell thee whence thou cam'st, of whom deriu'd,
585    Were shame enough, to shame thee,
586    Wert thou not shamelesse.
587    Thy Father beares the type of King of Naples,
588    Of both the Sicils, and Ierusalem,
589    Yet not so wealthie as an English Yeoman.
590    Hath that poore Monarch taught thee to insult?
591    It needes not, nor it bootes thee not, prowd Queene,
592    Vnlesse the Adage must be verify'd,
593    That Beggers mounted, runne their Horse to death.
594    'Tis Beautie that doth oft make Women prowd,
595    But God he knowes, thy share thereof is small.
596    'Tis Vertue, that doth make them most admir'd,
597    The contrary, doth make thee wondred at.
598    'Tis Gouernment that makes them seeme Diuine,
599    The want thereof, makes thee abhominable.
600    Thou art as opposite to euery good,
601    As the {Antipodes} are vnto vs,
602    Or as the South to the {Septentrion}.
603    Oh Tygres Heart, wrapt in a Womans Hide,
      <P o6v>
604    How could'st thou drayne the Life- blood of the Child,
605    To bid the Father wipe his eyes withall,
606    And yet be seene to beare a Womans face?
607    Women are soft, milde, pittifull, and flexible;
608    Thou, sterne, obdurate, flintie, rough, remorselesse.
609    Bidst thou me rage? why now thou hast thy wish.
610    Would'st haue me weepe? why now thou hast thy #will.
611    For raging Wind blowes vp incessant showers,
612    And when the Rage allayes, the Raine begins.
613    These Teares are my sweet {Rutlands} Obsequies,
614    And euery drop cryes vengeance for his death,
615    'Gainst thee fell {Clifford}, and thee false French- woman.
616   *<S {Northumb}.> Beshrew me, but his passions moues me so,
617    That hardly can I check my eyes from Teares.
618    <S {Yorke}.> That Face of his,
619    The hungry Caniballs would not haue toucht,
620    Would not haue stayn'd with blood:
621    But you are more inhumane, more inexorable,
622    Oh, tenne times more then Tygers of Hyrcania.
623    See, ruthlesse Queene,  a haplesse Fathers Teares:
624    This Cloth thou dipd'st in blood of my sweet Boy,
625    And I with Teares doe wash the blood away.
626    Keepe thou the Napkin, and goe boast of this,
627    And if thou tell'st the heauie storie right,
628    Vpon my Soule, the hearers will shed Teares:
629    Yea, euen my Foes will shed fast- falling Teares,
630    And say, Alas, it was a pittious deed.
631   *There, take the Crowne, and with the Crowne, my Curse,
632    And in thy need, such comfort come to thee,
633    As now I reape at thy too cruell hand.
634    Hard- hearted {Clifford}, take me from the World,
635    My Soule to Heauen, my Blood vpon your Heads.
636   *<S {Northumb}.> Had he been slaughter- man to all my Kinne,
637    I should not for my Life but weepe with him,
638    To see how inly Sorrow gripes his Soule.
639   *<S {Queen}.> What, weeping ripe, my Lord {Northumberland}?
640    Thinke but vpon the wrong he did vs all,
641    And that will quickly drie thy melting Teares.
642   *<S {Clifford}.> Heere's for my Oath, heere's for my Fathers
643    Death.
644   *<S {Queene}.> And heere's to right our gentle- hearted
645    King.
646    <S {Yorke}.> Open thy Gate of Mercy, gracious God,
647   *My Soule flyes through these wounds, to seeke out thee.
648    <S {Queene}.> Off with his Head, and set it on Yorke Gates,
649    So {Yorke} may ouer- looke the Towne of Yorke.
650    <D {Flourish. Exit}.>
651    <D {A March. Enter Edward, Richard},
652    {and their power}.>
653    <S {Edward}.> I wonder how our Princely Father scap't:
654    Or whether he be scap't away, or no,
655    From {Cliffords} and {Northumberlands} pursuit?
656    Had he been ta'ne, we should haue heard the newes;
657    Had he beene slaine, we should haue heard the newes:
658    Or had he scap't, me thinkes we should haue heard
659    The happy tidings of his good escape.
660    How fares my Brother? why is he so sad?
661    <S {Richard}.> I cannot ioy, vntill I be resolu'd
662    Where our right valiant Father is become.
663    I saw him in the Battaile range about,
664    And watcht him how he singled {Clifford} forth.
665    Me thought he bore him in the thickest troupe,
666    As doth a Lyon in a Heard of Neat,
667    Or as a Beare encompass'd round with Dogges:
668    Who hauing pincht a few, and made them cry,
669    The rest stand all aloofe, and barke at him.
670    So far'd our Father with his Enemies,
671    So fled his Enemies my Warlike Father:
672    Me thinkes 'tis prize enough to be his Sonne.
673    See how the Morning opes her golden Gates,
674    And takes her farwell of the glorious Sunne.
675    How well resembles it the prime of Youth,
676    Trimm'd like a Yonker, prauncing to his Loue?
677    <S {Ed}.> Dazle mine eyes, or doe I see three Sunnes?
678   *<S {Rich}.> Three glorious Sunnes, each one a perfect Sunne,
679    Not seperated with the racking Clouds,
680    But seuer'd in a pale cleare- shining Skye.
681    See, see, they ioyne, embrace, and seeme to kisse,
682    As if they vow'd some League inuiolable.
683    Now are they but one Lampe, one Light, one Sunne:
684    In this, the Heauen figures some euent.
685    <S {Edward}.> 'Tis wondrous strange,
686    The like yet neuer heard of.
687    I thinke it cites vs (Brother) to the field,
688    That wee, the Sonnes of braue {Plantagenet},
689    Each one alreadie blazing by our meedes,
690    Should notwithstanding ioyne our Lights together,
691    And ouer- shine the Earth, as this the World.
692    What ere it bodes, hence- forward will I beare
693    Vpon my Targuet three faire shining Sunnes.
694    <S {Richard}.> Nay, beare three Daughters:
695    By your leaue, I speake it,
696    You loue the Breeder better then the Male.
697    <D {Enter one blowing}.>
698    But what art thou, whose heauie Lookes fore- tell
699    Some dreadfull story hanging on thy Tongue?
700    <S {Mess}.> Ah, one that was a wofull looker on,
701    When as the Noble Duke of Yorke was slaine,
702    Your Princely Father, and my louing Lord.
703   *<S {Edward}.> Oh speake no more, for I haue heard too
704    much.
705    <S {Richard}.> Say how he dy'de, for I will heare it all.
706    <S {Mess}.> Enuironed he was with many foes,
707    And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
708    Against the Greekes, that would haue entred Troy.
709    But {Hercules} himselfe must yeeld to oddes:
710    And many stroakes, though with a little Axe,
711    Hewes downe and fells the hardest- tymber'd Oake.
712    By many hands your Father was subdu'd,
713    But onely slaught'red by the irefull Arme
714    Of vn- relenting {Clifford}, and the Queene:
715    Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despight,
716    Laugh'd in his face: and when with griefe he wept,
717    The ruthlesse Queene gaue him, to dry his Cheekes,
718    A Napkin, steeped in the harmelesse blood
719    Of sweet young {Rutland}, by rough {Clifford} slaine:
720    And after many scornes, many foule taunts,
721    They tooke his Head, and on the Gates of Yorke
722    They set the same, and there it doth remaine,
723    The saddest spectacle that ere I view'd.
724   *<S {Edward}.> Sweet Duke of Yorke, our Prop to leane vpon,
725    Now thou art gone, wee haue no Staffe, no Stay.
726    Oh {Clifford}, boyst'rous {Clifford}, thou hast slaine
727    The flowre of Europe, for his Cheualrie,
728    And trecherously hast thou vanquisht him,
729    For hand to hand he would haue vanquisht thee.
730    Now my Soules Pallace is become a Prison:
731    Ah, would she breake from hence, that this my body
      <P p1><C B>
732    Might in the ground be closed vp in rest:
733    For neuer henceforth shall I ioy againe:
734    Neuer, oh neuer shall I see more ioy.
735    <S {Rich}.> I cannot weepe: for all my bodies moysture
736    Scarse serues to quench my Furnace- burning hart:
737    Nor can my tongue vnloade my hearts great burthen,
738    For selfe- same winde that I should speake withall,
739    Is kindling coales that fires all my brest,
740   *And burnes me vp with flames, that tears would quench.
741    To weepe, is to make lesse the depth of greefe:
742    Teares then for Babes; Blowes, and Reuenge for mee.
743    {#Richard}, I beare thy name, Ile venge thy death,
744    Or dye renowned by attempting it.
745    <S {Ed}.> His name that valiant Duke hath left with thee:
746    His Dukedome, and his Chaire with me is left.
747    <S {Rich}.> Nay, if thou be that Princely Eagles Bird,
748    Shew thy descent by gazing 'gainst the Sunne:
749    For Chaire and Dukedome, Throne and Kingdome say,
750    Either that is thine, or else thou wer't not his.
751    <D {March. Enter Warwicke, Marquesse Mountacute},
752    {and their Army}.>
753   *<S {Warwick}.> How now faire Lords? What faire? What
754    newes abroad?
755   *<S {Rich}.> Great Lord of Warwicke, if we should recompt
756    Our balefull newes, and at each words deliuerance
757    Stab Poniards in our flesh, till all were told,
758    The words would adde more anguish then the wounds.
759    O valiant Lord, the Duke of Yorke is slaine.
760    <S {Edw}.> O Warwicke, Warwicke, that {Plantagenet}
761    Which held thee deerely, as his Soules Redemption,
762    Is by the sterne Lord {Clifford} done to death.
763   *<S {War}.> Ten dayes ago, I drown'd these newes in teares.
764    And now to adde more measure to your woes,
765    I come to tell you things sith then befalne.
766    After the bloody Fray at Wakefield fought,
767    Where your braue Father breath'd his latest gaspe,
768    Tydings, as swiftly as the Postes could runne,
769    Were brought me of your Losse, and his Depart.
770    I then in London, keeper of the King,
771    Muster'd my Soldiers, gathered flockes of Friends,
772    Marcht toward S[aint]. Albons, to intercept the Queene,
773    Bearing the King in my behalfe along:
774    For by my Scouts, I was aduertised
775    That she was comming with a full intent
776    To dash our late Decree in Parliament,
777    Touching King {Henries} Oath, and your Succession:
778    Short Tale to make, we at S[aint]. Albons met,
779    Our Battailes ioyn'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
780    But whether 'twas the coldnesse of the King,
781    Who look'd full gently on his warlike Queene,
782    That robb'd my Soldiers of their heated Spleene.
783    Or whether 'twas report of her successe,
784    Or more then common feare of {Cliffords} Rigour,
785    Who thunders to his Captiues, Blood and Death,
786    I cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,
787    Their Weapons like to Lightning, came and went:
788    Our Souldiers like the Night- Owles lazie flight,
789    Or like a lazie Thresher with a Flaile,
790    Fell gently downe, as if they strucke their Friends.
791    I cheer'd them vp with iustice of our Cause,
792    With promise of high pay, and great Rewards:
793    But all in vaine, they had no heart to fight,
794    And we (in them) no hope to win the day,
795    So that we fled: the King vnto the Queene,
796    Lord {George}, your Brother, Norfolke, and my Selfe,
797    In haste, post haste, are come to ioyne with you:
798    For in the Marches heere we heard you were,
799    Making another Head, to fight againe.
800   *<S {Ed}.> Where is the Duke of Norfolke, gentle Warwick?
801    And when came {George} from Burgundy to England?
802   *<S {War}.> Some six miles off the Duke is with the Soldiers,
803    And for your Brother he was lately sent
804    From your kinde Aunt Dutchesse of Burgundie,
805    With ayde of Souldiers to this needfull Warre.
806   *<S {Rich}.> 'Twas oddes belike, when valiant Warwick fled;
807    Oft haue I heard his praises in Pursuite,
808    But ne're till now, his Scandall of Retire.
809   *<S {War}.> Nor now my Scandall {Richard}, dost thou heare:
810    For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine,
811    Can plucke the Diadem from faint {Henries} head,
812    And wring the awefull Scepter from his Fist,
813    Were he as famous, and as bold in Warre,
814    As he is fam'd for Mildnesse, Peace, and Prayer.
815    <S {Rich}.> I know it well Lord Warwick, blame me not,
816    'Tis loue I beare thy glories make me speake:
817    But in this troublous time, what's to be done?
818    Shall we go throw away our Coates of Steele,
819    And wrap our bodies in blacke mourning Gownes,
820    Numb'ring our Aue- Maries with our Beads?
821    Or shall we on the Helmets of our Foes
822    Tell our Deuotion with reuengefull Armes?
823    If for the last, say #I, and to it Lords.
824   *<S {War}.> Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out,
825    And therefore comes my Brother {Mountague}:
826    Attend me Lords, the proud insulting Queene,
827    With {Clifford}, and the haught Northumberland,
828    And of their Feather, many moe proud Birds,
829    Haue wrought the easie- melting King, like Wax.
830    He swore consent to your Succession,
831    His Oath enrolled in the Parliament.
832    And now to London all the crew are gone,
833    To frustrate both his Oath, and what beside
834    May make against the house of Lancaster.
835    Their power (I thinke) is thirty thousand strong:
836    Now, if the helpe of Norfolke, and my selfe,
837    With all the Friends that thou braue Earle of March,
838    Among'st the louing Welshmen can'st procure,
839    Will but amount to fiue and twenty thousand,
840    Why Via, to London will we march,
841    And once againe, bestride our foaming Steeds,
842    And once againe cry Charge vpon our Foes,
843    But neuer once againe turne backe and flye.
844   *<S {Rich}.> #I, now me thinks I heare great Warwick speak;
845    Ne're may he liue to see a Sun- shine day,
846    That cries Retire, if Warwicke bid him stay.
847    <S {Ed}.> Lord Warwicke, on thy shoulder will I leane,
848    And when thou failst (as God forbid the houre)
849    Must {Edward} fall, which perill heauen forefend.
850   *<S {War}.> No longer Earle of March, but Duke of Yorke:
851    The next degree, is Englands Royall Throne:
852    For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
853    In euery Burrough as we passe along,
854    And he that throwes not vp his cap for ioy,
855    Shall for the Fault make forfeit of his head.
856    King {Edward}, valiant {Richard Mountague}:
857    Stay we no longer, dreaming of Renowne.
858    But sound the Trumpets, and about our Taske.
859   *<S {Rich}.> Then {Clifford}, were thy heart as hard as Steele,
860    As thou hast shewne it flintie by thy deeds,
861    I come to pierce it, or to giue thee mine.
862    <S {Ed}.> Then strike vp Drums, God and S[aint]. George for vs.
      <P p1v>
863    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
864    <S {War}.> How now? what newes?
865   *<S {Mes}.> The Duke of Norfolke sends you word by me,
866    The Queene is comming with a puissant Hoast,
867    And craues your company, for speedy counsell.
868    <S {War}.> Why then it sorts, braue Warriors, let's away.
869    <D {Exeunt Omnes}.>
870   *<D {Flourish. Enter the King, the Queene, Clifford, Northum-[berland]}
871    {and Yong Prince, with Drumme and}
872    {Trumpettes}.>
873   *<S {Qu}.> Welcome my Lord, to this braue town of Yorke,
874    Yonders the head of that Arch- enemy,
875    That sought to be incompast with your Crowne.
876    Doth not the obiect cheere your heart, my Lord.
877   *<S {K}.> #I, as the rockes cheare them that feare their wrack,
878    To see this sight, it irkes my very soule:
879    With- hold reuenge (deere God) 'tis not my fault,
880    Nor wittingly haue I infring'd my Vow.
881    <S {Clif}.> My gracious Liege, this too much lenity
882    And harmfull pitty must be layd aside:
883    To whom do Lyons cast their gentle Lookes?
884    Not to the Beast, that would vsurpe their Den.
885    Whose hand is that the Forrest Beare doth licke?
886    Not his that spoyles her yong before her face.
887    Who scapes the lurking Serpents mortall sting?
888    Not he that sets his foot vpon her backe.
889    The smallest Worme will turne, being troden on,
890    And Doues will pecke in safegard of their Brood.
891    Ambitious Yorke, did leuell at thy Crowne,
892    Thou smiling, while he knit his angry browes.
893    He but a Duke, would haue his Sonne a King,
894    And raise his issue like a louing Sire.
895    Thou being a King, blest with a goodly sonne,
896    Did'st yeeld consent to disinherit him:
897    Which argued thee a most vnlouing Father.
898    Vnreasonable Creatures feed their young,
899    And though mans face be fearefull to their eyes,
900    Yet in protection of their tender ones,
901    Who hath not seene them euen with those wings,
902    Which sometime they haue vs'd with fearfull flight,
903    Make warre with him that climb'd vnto their nest,
904    Offering their owne liues in their yongs defence?
905    For shame, my Liege, make them your President:
906    Were it not pitty that this goodly Boy
907    Should loose his Birth- right by his Fathers fault,
908    And long heereafter say vnto his childe,
909    What my great Grandfather, and Grandsire got,
910    My carelesse Father fondly gaue away.
911    Ah, what a shame were this? Looke on the Boy,
912    And let his manly face, which promiseth
913    Successefull Fortune steele thy melting heart,
914    To hold thine owne, and leaue thine owne with him.
915    <S {King}.> Full well hath {Clifford} plaid the Orator,
916    Inferring arguments of mighty force:
917    But {Clifford} tell me, did'st thou neuer heare,
918    That things #ill got, had euer bad successe.
919    And happy alwayes was it for that Sonne,
920    Whose Father for his hoording went to #hell:
921    Ile leaue my Sonne my Vertuous deeds behinde,
922    And would my Father had left me no more:
923    For all the rest is held at such a Rate,
924    As brings a thousand fold more care to keepe,
925    Then in possession any iot of pleasure.
926    Ah Cosin Yorke, would thy best Friends did know,
927    How it doth greeue me that thy head is heere.
928   *<S {Qu}.> My Lord cheere vp your spirits, our foes are nye,
929    And this soft courage makes your Followers faint:
930    You promist Knighthood to our forward sonne,
931    Vnsheath your sword, and dub him presently.
932    {#Edward}, kneele downe.
933    <S {King}.> {Edward Plantagenet}, arise a Knight,
934    And learne this Lesson; Draw thy Sword in right.
935    <S {Prin}.> My gracious Father, by your Kingly leaue,
936    Ile draw it as Apparant to the Crowne,
937    And in that quarrell, vse it to the death.
938    <S {Clif}.> Why that is spoken like a toward Prince.
939    <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
940    <S {Mess}.> Royall Commanders, be in readinesse,
941    For with a Band of thirty thousand men,
942    Comes Warwicke backing of the Duke of Yorke,
943    And in the Townes as they do march along,
944    Proclaimes him King, and many flye to him,
945    Darraigne your battell, for they are at hand.
946    <S {Clif}.> I would your Highnesse would depart the field,
947    The Queene hath best successe when you are absent.
948    <S {Qu}.> #I good my Lord, and leaue vs to our Fortune.
949    <S {King}.> Why, that's my fortune too, therefore Ile stay.
950    <S {North}.> Be it with resolution then to fight.
951    <S {Prin}.> My Royall Father, cheere these Noble Lords,
952    And hearten those that fight in your defence:
953    Vnsheath your Sword, good Father: Cry S[aint]. George.
954    <D {March. Enter Edward, Warwicke, Richard, Clarence},
955    {Norfolke, Mountague, and Soldiers}.>
956   *<S {Edw}.> Now periur'd {Henry}, wilt thou kneel for grace?
957    And set thy Diadem vpon my head?
958    Or bide the mortall Fortune of the field.
959    <S {Qu}.> Go rate thy Minions, proud insulting Boy,
960    Becomes it thee to be thus bold in termes,
961    Before thy Soueraigne, and thy lawfull King?
962    <S {Ed}.> I am his King, and he should bow his knee:
963    I was adopted Heire by his consent.
964    <S {Cla}.> Since when, his Oath is broke: for as I heare,
965    You that are King, though he do weare the Crowne,
966    Haue caus'd him by new Act of Parliament,
967    To blot out me, and put his owne Sonne in.
968    <S {Clif}.> And reason too,
969    Who should succeede the Father, but the Sonne.
970    <S {Rich}.> Are you there Butcher? O, I cannot speake.
971    <S {Clif}.> #I Crooke- back, here I stand to answer thee,
972    Or any #he, the proudest of thy sort.
973   *<S {Rich}.> 'Twas you that kill'd yong Rutland, was it not?
974    <S {Clif}.> #I, and old Yorke, and yet not satisfied.
975    <S {Rich}.> For Gods sake Lords giue signall to the fight.
976    <S {War}.> What say'st thou {Henry},
977    Wilt thou yeeld the Crowne?
978   *<S {Qu}.> Why how now long- tongu'd Warwicke, dare |(you speak?
979    When you and I, met at S[aint]. {Albons} last,
980    Your legges did better seruice then your hands.
981   *<S {War}.> Then 'twas my turne to fly, and now 'tis thine:
982    <S {Clif}.> You said so much before, and yet you fled.
983   *<S {War}.> 'Twas not your valor {Clifford} droue me thence.
984   *<S {Nor}.> No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
985    <S {Rich}.> Northumberland, I hold thee reuerently,
986    Breake off the parley, for scarse I can refraine
987    The execution of my big- swolne heart
988    Vpon that {Clifford}, that cruell Child- killer.
989    <S {Clif}.> I slew thy Father, cal'st thou him a Child?
      <P p2>
990    <S {Rich}.> #I like a Dastard, and a treacherous Coward,
991    As thou didd'st kill our tender Brother Rutland,
992    But ere Sunset, Ile make thee curse the deed.
993   *<S {King}.> Haue done with words (my Lords) and heare
994    me speake.
995    <S {Qu}.> Defie them then, or els hold close thy lips.
996    <S {King}.> I prythee giue no limits to my Tongue,
997    I am a King, and priuiledg'd to speake.
998   *<S {Clif}.> My Liege, the wound that bred this meeting here,
999    Cannot be cur'd by Words, therefore be still.
1000   <S {Rich}.> Then Executioner vnsheath thy sword:
1001   By him that made vs all, I am resolu'd,
1002   That {Cliffords} Manhood, lyes vpon his tongue.
1003   <S {Ed}.> Say {Henry}, shall I haue my right, or no:
1004   A thousand men haue broke their Fasts to day,
1005   That ne're shall dine, vnlesse thou yeeld the Crowne.
1006   <S {War}.> If thou deny, their Blood vpon thy head,
1007   For Yorke in iustice put's his Armour on.
1008  *<S {Pr.Ed}.> If that be right, which Warwick saies is right,
1009   There is no wrong, but euery thing is right.
1010   <S {War}.> Who euer got thee, there thy Mother stands,
1011   For well I wot, thou hast thy Mothers tongue.
1012   <S {Qu}.> But thou art neyther like thy Sire nor Damme,
1013   But like a foule mishapen Stygmaticke,
1014   Mark'd by the Destinies to be auoided,
1015   As venome Toades, or Lizards dreadfull stings.
1016   <S {Rich}.> Iron of Naples, hid with English gilt,
1017   Whose Father beares the Title of a King,
1018   (As if a Channell should be call'd the Sea)
1019   Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
1020   To let thy tongue detect thy base- borne heart.
1021  *<S {Ed}.> A wispe of straw were worth a thousand Crowns,
1022   To make this shamelesse Callet know her selfe:
1023   {Helen} of Greece was fayrer farre then thou,
1024   Although thy Husband may be {Menelaus};
1025   And ne're was {Agamemnons} Brother wrong'd
1026   By that false Woman, as this King by thee.
1027   His Father reuel'd in the heart of France,
1028   And tam'd the King, and made the Dolphin stoope:
1029   And had he match'd according to his State,
1030   He might haue kept that glory to this day.
1031   But when he tooke a begger to his bed,
1032   And grac'd thy poore Sire with his Bridall day,
1033   Euen then that Sun- shine brew'd a showre for him,
1034   That washt his Fathers fortunes forth of France,
1035   And heap'd sedition on his Crowne at home:
1036   For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy Pride?
1037   Had'st thou bene meeke, our Title still had slept,
1038   And we in pitty of the Gentle King,
1039   Had slipt our Claime, vntill another Age.
1040  *<S {Cla}.> But when we saw, our Sunshine made thy Spring,
1041   And that thy Summer bred vs no increase,
1042   We set the Axe to thy vsurping Roote:
1043   And though the edge hath something hit our selues,
1044   Yet know thou, since we haue begun to strike,
1045   Wee'l neuer leaue, till we haue hewne thee downe,
1046   Or bath'd thy growing, with our heated bloods.
1047   <S {Edw}.> And in this resolution, I defie thee,
1048   Not willing any longer Conference,
1049   Since thou denied'st the gentle King to speake.
1050   Sound Trumpets, let our bloody Colours waue,
1051   And either Victorie, or else a Graue.
1052   <S {Qu}.> Stay {Edward}.
1053   <S {Ed}.> No wrangling Woman, wee'l no longer stay,
1054   These words will cost ten thousand liues this day.
1055   <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
1056   <D {Alarum. Excursions. Enter Warwicke}.>
1057  *<S {War}.> Fore- spent with Toile, as Runners with a Race,
1058   I lay me downe a little while to breath:
1059   For strokes receiu'd, and many blowes repaid,
1060   Haue robb'd my strong knit sinewes of their strength,
1061   And spight of spight, needs must I rest a- while.
1062   <D {Enter Edward running}.>
1063   <S {Ed}.> Smile gentle heauen, or strike vngentle death,
1064   For this world frownes, and {Edwards} Sunne is clowded.
1065  *<S {War}.> How now my Lord, what happe? what hope of
1066   good?
1067   <D {Enter Clarence}.>
1068   <S {Cla}.> Our hap is losse, our hope but sad dispaire,
1069   Our rankes are broke, and ruine followes vs.
1070   What counsaile giue you? whether shall we flye?
1071   <S {Ed}.> Bootlesse is flight, they follow vs with Wings,
1072   And weake we are, and cannot shun pursuite.
1073   <D {Enter Richard}.>
1074  *<S {Rich}.> Ah Warwicke, why hast y withdrawn thy selfe?
1075   Thy Brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
1076   Broach'd with the Steely point of {Cliffords} Launce:
1077   And in the very pangs of death, he cryde,
1078   Like to a dismall Clangor heard from farre,
1079   Warwicke, reuenge; Brother, reuenge my death.
1080   So vnderneath the belly of their Steeds,
1081   That stain'd their Fetlockes in his smoaking blood,
1082   The Noble Gentleman gaue vp the ghost.
1083   <S {War}.> Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
1084   Ile kill my Horse, because I will not flye:
1085   Why stand we like soft- hearted women heere,
1086   Wayling our losses, whiles the Foe doth Rage,
1087   And looke vpon, as if the Tragedie
1088   Were plaid in iest, by counterfetting Actors.
1089   Heere on my knee, I vow to God aboue,
1090   Ile neuer pawse againe, neuer stand still,
1091   Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine,
1092   Or Fortune giuen me measure of Reuenge.
1093   <S {Ed}.> Oh Warwicke, I do bend my knee with thine,
1094   And in this vow do chaine my soule to thine:
1095   And ere my knee rise from the Earths cold face,
1096   I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
1097   Thou setter vp, and plucker downe of Kings:
1098   Beseeching thee (if with thy #will it stands)
1099   That to my Foes this body must be prey,
1100   Yet that thy brazen gates of heauen may ope,
1101   And giue sweet passage to my sinfull soule.
1102   Now Lords, take leaue vntill we meete againe,
1103   Where ere it be, in heauen, or in earth.
1104   <S {Rich}.> Brother,
1105   Giue me thy hand, and gentle Warwicke,
1106   Let me imbrace thee in my weary armes:
1107   I that did neuer weepe, now melt with wo,
1108   That Winter should cut off our Spring- time so.
1109   <S {War}.> Away, away:
1110   Once more sweet Lords farwell.
1111   <S {Cla}.> Yet let vs altogether to our Troopes,
1112   And giue them leaue to flye, that will not stay:
1113   And call them Pillars that will stand to vs:
1114   And if we thriue, promise them such rewards
1115   As Victors weare at the Olympian Games.
1116   This may plant courage in their quailing breasts,
1117   For yet is hope of Life and Victory:
      <P p2v>
1118   Foreslow no longer, make we hence amaine. <D {Exeunt}>
1119   <D {Excursions. Enter Richard and Clifford}.>
1120   <S {Rich}.> Now {Clifford}, I haue singled thee alone,
1121   Suppose this arme is for the Duke of Yorke,
1122   And this for Rutland, both bound to reuenge,
1123   Wer't thou inuiron'd with a Brazen wall.
1124   <S {Clif}.> Now {Richard}, I am with thee heere alone,
1125   This is the hand that stabb'd thy Father Yorke,
1126   And this the hand, that slew thy Brother Rutland,
1127   And here's the heart, that triumphs in their death,
1128  *And cheeres these hands, that slew thy Sire and Brother,
1129   To execute the like vpon thy selfe,
1130   And so haue at thee.
1131   <D {They Fight, Warwicke comes, Clifford flies}.>
1132   <S {Rich}.> Nay Warwicke, single out some other Chace,
1133   For I my selfe will hunt this Wolfe to death.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1134   <D {Alarum. Enter King Henry alone}.>
1135   <S {Hen}.> This battell fares like to the mornings Warre,
1136   When dying clouds contend, with growing light,
1137   What time the Shepheard blowing of his nailes,
1138   Can neither call it perfect day, nor night.
1139   Now swayes it this way, like a Mighty Sea,
1140   Forc'd by the Tide, to combat with the Winde:
1141   Now swayes it that way, like the selfe- same Sea,
1142   Forc'd to retyre by furie of the Winde.
1143   Sometime, the Flood preuailes; and than the Winde:
1144   Now, one the better: then, another best;
1145   Both tugging to be Victors, brest to brest:
1146   Yet neither Conqueror, nor Conquered.
1147   So is the equall poise of this fell Warre.
1148   Heere on this Mole- hill will I sit me downe,
1149   To whom God will, there be the Victorie:
1150   For {Margaret} my Queene, and {Clifford} too
1151   Haue chid me from the Battell: Swearing both,
1152   They prosper best of all when I am thence.
1153   Would I were dead, if Gods good #will were so;
1154   For what is in this world, but Greefe and Woe.
1155   Oh God! me thinkes it were a happy life,
1156   To be no better then a homely Swaine,
1157   To sit vpon a hill, as I do now,
1158   To carue out Dialls queintly, point by point,
1159   Thereby to see the Minutes how they runne:
1160   How many makes the Houre full compleate,
1161   How many Houres brings about the Day,
1162   How many Dayes will finish vp the Yeare,
1163   How many Yeares, a Mortall man may liue.
1164   When this is knowne, then to diuide the Times:
1165   So many Houres, must I tend my Flocke;
1166   So many Houres, must I take my Rest:
1167   So many Houres, must I Contemplate:
1168   So many Houres, must I Sport my selfe:
1169   So many Dayes, my Ewes haue bene with yong:
1170   So many weekes, ere the poore Fooles will Eane:
1171   So many yeares, ere I shall sheere the Fleece:
1172   So Minutes, Houres, Dayes, Monthes, and Yeares,
1173   Past ouer to the end they were created,
1174   Would bring white haires, vnto a Quiet graue.
1175   Ah! what a life were this? How sweet? how louely?
1176   Giues not the Hawthorne bush a sweeter shade
1177   To Shepheards, looking on their silly Sheepe,
1178   Then doth a rich Imbroider'd Canopie
1179   To Kings, that feare their Subiects treacherie?
1180   Oh yes, it doth; a thousand fold it doth.
1181   And to conclude, the Shepherds homely Curds,
1182   His cold thinne drinke out of his Leather Bottle,
1183   His wonted sleepe, vnder a fresh trees shade,
1184   All which secure, and sweetly he enioyes,
1185   Is farre beyond a Princes Delicates:
1186   His Viands sparkling in a Golden Cup,
1187   His bodie couched in a curious bed,
1188   When Care, Mistrust, and Treason waits on him.
1189   <D {Alarum. Enter a Sonne that hath kill'd his Father, at}
1190  *{one doore: and a Father that hath kill'd his Sonne at ano-ther}
1191   {doore}.
1192   <S {Son}.> #Ill blowes the winde that profits no body,
1193   This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
1194   May be possessed with some store of Crownes,
1195   And I that (haply) take them from him now,
1196   May yet (ere night) yeeld both my Life and them
1197   To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
1198   Who's this? Oh God! It is my Fathers face,
1199   Whom in this Conflict, I (vnwares) haue kill'd:
1200   Oh heauy times! begetting such Euents.
1201   From London, by the King was I prest forth,
1202   My Father being the Earle of Warwickes man,
1203   Came on the part of Yorke, prest by his Master:
1204   And I, who at his hands receiu'd my life,
1205   Haue by my hands, of Life bereaued him.
1206   Pardon me God, I knew not what I did:
1207   And pardon Father, for I knew not thee.
1208   My Teares shall wipe away these bloody markes:
1209   And no more words, till they haue flow'd their fill.
1210   <S {King}.> O pitteous spectacle! O bloody Times!
1211   Whiles Lyons Warre, and battaile for their Dennes,
1212   Poore harmlesse Lambes abide their enmity.
1213   Weepe wretched man: Ile ayde thee Teare for Teare,
1214   And let our hearts and eyes, like Ciuill Warre,
1215  *Be blinde with teares, and break ore- charg'd with griefe
1216   <D {Enter Father, bearing of his Sonne}.>
1217   <S {Fa}.> Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
1218   Giue me thy Gold, if thou hast any Gold:
1219   For I haue bought it with an hundred blowes.
1220   But let me see: Is this our Foe- mans face?
1221   Ah, no, no, no, it is mine onely Sonne.
1222   Ah Boy, if any life be left in thee,
1223   Throw vp thine eye: see, see, what showres arise,
1224   Blowne with the windie Tempest of my heart,
1225   Vpon thy wounds, that killes mine Eye, and Heart.
1226   O pitty God, this miserable Age!
1227   What Stratagems? how fell? how Butcherly?
1228   Erreoneous, mutinous, and vnnaturall,
1229   This deadly quarrell daily doth beget?
1230   O Boy! thy Father gaue thee life too soone,
1231   And hath bereft thee of thy life too late.
1232  *<S {King}.> Wo aboue wo: greefe, more the[n] common greefe
1233   O that my death would stay these ruthfull deeds:
1234   O pitty, pitty, gentle heauen pitty:
1235   The Red Rose and the White are on his face,
1236   The fatall Colours of our striuing Houses:
1237   The one, his purple Blood right well resembles,
1238   The other his pale Cheekes (me thinkes) presenteth:
1239   Wither one Rose, and let the other flourish:
1240   If you contend, a thousand liues must wither.
1241   <S {Son}.> How will my Mother, for a Fathers death
1242   Take on with me, and ne're be satisfi'd?
1243   <S {Fa}.> How will my Wife, for slaughter of my Sonne,
1244   Shed seas of Teares, and ne're be satisfi'd?
1245  *<S {King}.> How will the Country, for these woful chances,
      <P p3>
1246   Mis- thinke the King, and not be satisfied?
1247   <S {Son}.> Was euer sonne, so rew'd a Fathers death?
1248   <S {Fath}.> Was euer Father so bemoan'd his Sonne?
1249   <S {Hen}.> Was euer King so greeu'd for Subiects woe?
1250   Much is your sorrow; Mine, ten times so much.
1251  *<S {Son}.> Ile beare thee hence, where I may weepe my fill.
1252  *<S {Fath}.> These armes of mine shall be thy winding sheet:
1253   My heart (sweet Boy) shall be thy Sepulcher,
1254   For from my heart, thine Image ne're shall go.
1255   My sighing brest, shall be thy Funerall bell;
1256   And so obsequious will thy Father be,
1257   Men for the losse of thee, hauing no more,
1258   As {Priam} was for all his Valiant Sonnes,
1259   Ile beare thee hence, and let them fight that will,
1260   For I haue murthered where I should not kill.  <D {Exit}>
1261   <S {Hen}.> Sad- hearted- men, much ouergone with Care;
1262   Heere sits a King, more wofull then you are.
1263   <D {Alarums. Excursions. Enter the Queen, the}
1264   {Prince, and Exeter}.>
1265   <S {Prin}.> Fly Father, flye: for all your Friends are fled.
1266   And Warwicke rages like a chafed Bull:
1267   Away, for death doth hold vs in pursuite.
1268  *<S {Qu}.> Mount you my Lord, towards Barwicke post a-maine:
1269  _
1270   {#Edward} and {Richard} like a brace of Grey- hounds,
1271   Hauing the fearfull flying Hare in sight,
1272   With fiery eyes, sparkling for very wrath,
1273   And bloody steele graspt in their yrefull hands
1274   Are at our backes, and therefore hence amaine.
1275  *<S {Exet}.> Away: for vengeance comes along with them.
1276   Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed,
1277   Or else come after, Ile away before.
1278   <S {Hen}.> Nay take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
1279   Not that I feare to stay, but loue to go
1280   Whether the Queene intends. Forward, away.  <D {Exeunt}>
1281   <D {A lowd alarum. Enter Clifford Wounded}.>
1282   <S {Clif}.> Heere burnes my Candle out; #I, heere it dies,
1283   Which whiles it lasted, gaue King {Henry} light.
1284   O Lancaster! I feare thy ouerthrow,
1285   More then my Bodies parting with my Soule:
1286   My Loue and Feare, glew'd many Friends to thee,
1287   And now I fall. Thy tough Commixtures melts,
1288   Impairing {Henry}, strength'ning misproud Yorke;
1289   And whether flye the Gnats, but to the Sunne?
1290   And who shines now, but {Henries} Enemies?
1291   O Phoebus! had'st thou neuer giuen consent,
1292   That {Phaeton} should checke thy fiery Steeds,
1293   Thy burning Carre neuer had scorch'd the earth.
1294   And {Henry}, had'st thou sway'd as Kings should do,
1295   Or as thy Father, and his Father did,
1296   Giuing no ground vnto the house of Yorke,
1297   They neuer then had sprung like Sommer Flyes:
1298   #I, and ten thousand in this lucklesse Realme,
1299   Had left no mourning Widdowes for our death,
1300   And thou this day, had'st kept thy Chaire in peace.
1301   For what doth cherrish Weeds, but gentle ayre?
1302   And what makes Robbers bold, but too much lenity?
1303   Bootlesse are Plaints, and Curelesse are my Wounds:
1304   No way to flye, no strength to hold out flight:
1305   The Foe is mercilesse, and will not pitty:
1306   For at their hands I haue deseru'd no pitty.
1307   The ayre hath got into my deadly Wounds,
1308   And much effuse of blood, doth make me faint:
1309   Come {Yorke}, and {Richard}, {Warwicke}, and the rest,
1310   I stab'd your Fathers bosomes; Split my brest.
1311  *<D {Alarum & Retreat. Enter Edward, Warwicke, Richard, and}
1312   {Soldiers, Montague, & Clarence}.>
1313  *<S {Ed}.> Now breath we Lords, good fortune bids vs pause,
1314  *And smooth the frownes of War, with peacefull lookes:
1315   Some Troopes pursue the bloody- minded Queene,
1316   That led calme {Henry}, though he were a King,
1317   As doth a Saile, fill'd with a fretting Gust
1318   Command an Argosie to stemme the Waues.
1319   But thinke you (Lords) that Clifford fled with them?
1320   <S {War}.> No, 'tis impossible he should escape:
1321   (For though before his face I speake the words)
1322   Your Brother {Richard} markt him for the Graue.
1323   And wheresoere he is, hee's surely dead.  <D {Clifford grones}>
1324  *<S {Rich}.> Whose soule is that which takes hir heauy leaue?
1325   A deadly grone, like life and deaths departing.
1326   See who it is.
1327   <S {Ed}.> And now the Battailes ended,
1328   If Friend or Foe, let him be gently vsed.
1329   <S {Rich}.> Reuoke that doome of mercy, for 'tis {Clifford},
1330   Who not contented that he lopp'd the Branch
1331   In hewing Rutland, when his leaues put forth,
1332   But set his murth'ring knife vnto the Roote,
1333   From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
1334   I meane our Princely Father, Duke of Yorke.
1335  *<S {War}.> From off the gates of Yorke, fetch down y head,
1336   Your Fathers head, which {Clifford} placed there:
1337   In stead whereof, let this supply the roome,
1338   Measure for measure, must be answered.
1339  *<S {Ed}.> Bring forth that fatall Schreechowle to our house,
1340   That nothing sung but death, to vs and ours:
1341   Now death shall stop his dismall threatning sound,
1342   And his ill- boading tongue, no more shall speake.
1343   <S {War}.> I thinke his vnderstanding is bereft:
1344   Speake {Clifford}, dost thou know who speakes to thee?
1345   Darke cloudy death ore- shades his beames of life,
1346   And he nor sees, nor heares vs, what we say.
1347   <S {Rich}.> O would he did, and so (perhaps) he doth,
1348   'Tis but his policy to counterfet,
1349   Because he would auoid such bitter taunts
1350   Which in the time of death he gaue our Father.
1351   <S {Cla}.> If so thou think'st,
1352   Vex him with eager Words.
1353   <S {Rich}.> {Clifford}, aske mercy, and obtaine no grace.
1354   <S {Ed}.> {Clifford}, repent in bootlesse penitence.
1355   <S {War}.> {Clifford}, deuise excuses for thy faults.
1356   <S {Cla}.> While we deuise fell Tortures for thy faults.
1357  *<S {Rich}.> Thou didd'st loue Yorke, and I am son to Yorke.
1358   <S {Edw}.> Thou pittied'st Rutland, I will pitty thee.
1359  *<S {Cla}.> Where's Captaine {Margaret}, to fence you now?
1360   <S {War}.> They mocke thee {Clifford},
1361   Sweare as thou was't wont.
1362  *<S {Ric}.> What, not an Oath? Nay then the world go's hard
1363   When {Clifford} cannot spare his Friends an oath:
1364   I know by that he's dead, and by my Soule,
1365   If this right hand would buy two houres life,
1366   That I (in all despight) might rayle at him,
1367  *This hand should chop it off: & with the issuing Blood
1368   Stifle the Villaine, whose vnstanched thirst
1369   Yorke, and yong Rutland could not satisfie
1370   <S {War}.> #I, but he's dead. #Of with the Traitors head,
1371   And reare it in the place your Fathers stands.
1372   And now to London with Triumphant march,
      <P p3v>
1373   There to be crowned Englands Royall King:
1374   From whence, shall Warwicke cut the Sea to France,
1375   And aske the Ladie {Bona} for thy Queene:
1376   So shalt thou sinow both these Lands together,
1377   And hauing France thy Friend, thou shalt not dread
1378   The scattred Foe, that hopes to rise againe:
1379   For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
1380   Yet looke to haue them buz to offend thine eares:
1381   First, will I see the Coronation,
1382   And then to Britanny Ile crosse the Sea,
1383   To effect this marriage, so it please my Lord.
1384   <S {Ed}.> Euen as thou wilt sweet Warwicke, let it bee:
1385   For in thy shoulder do I builde my Seate;
1386   And neuer will I vndertake the thing
1387   Wherein thy counsaile and consent is wanting:
1388   {#Richard}, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
1389   And {George} of Clarence; {Warwicke} as our Selfe,
1390   Shall do, and vndo as him pleaseth best.
1391   <S {Rich}.> Let me be Duke of Clarence, {George} of Gloster,
1392   For Glosters Dukedome is too ominous.
1393   <S {War}.> Tut, that's a foolish obseruation:
1394   {#Richard}, be Duke of Gloster: Now to London,
1395   To see these Honors in possession.  <D {Exeunt}>
1396   <D {Enter Sinklo, and Humfrey, with Crosse- bowes}
1397   {in their hands}.>
1398  *<S {Sink}.> Vnder this thicke growne brake, wee'l shrowd |(our selues:
1399   For through this Laund anon the Deere will come,
1400   And in this couert will we make our Stand,
1401   Culling the principall of all the Deere.
1402   <S {Hum}.> Ile stay aboue the hill, so both may shoot.
1403   <S {Sink}.> That cannot be, the noise of thy Crosse- bow
1404   Will scarre the Heard, and so my shoot is lost:
1405   Heere stand we both, and ayme we at the best:
1406   And for the time shall not seeme tedious,
1407   Ile tell thee what befell me on a day,
1408   In this selfe- place, where now we meane to stand.
1409   <S {Sink}.> Heere comes a man, let's stay till he be past:
1410   <D {Enter the King with a Prayer booke}.>
1411   <S {Hen}.> From Scotland am I stolne euen of pure loue,
1412   To greet mine owne Land with my wishfull sight:
1413   No {Harry}, {Harry}, 'tis no Land of thine,
1414   Thy place is fill'd, thy Scepter wrung from thee,
1415   Thy Balme washt off, wherewith thou was Annointed:
1416   No bending knee will call thee {Caesar} now,
1417   No humble suters prease to speake for right:
1418   No, not a man comes for redresse of thee:
1419   For how can I helpe them, and not my selfe?
1420   <S {Sink}.> #I, heere's a Deere, whose skin's a Keepers Fee:
1421   This is the quondam King; Let's seize vpon him.
1422   <S {Hen}.> Let me embrace the sower Aduersaries,
1423   For Wise men say, it is the wisest course.
1424   <S {Hum}.> Why linger we? Let vs lay hands vpon him.
1425   <S {Sink}.> Forbeare a- while, wee'l heare a little more.
1426  *<S {Hen}.> My Queene and Son are gone to France for aid:
1427   And (as I heare) the great Commanding Warwicke
1428   #I: thither gone, to craue the French Kings Sister
1429   To wife for {Edward}. If this newes be true,
1430   Poore Queene, and Sonne, your labour is but lost:
1431   For Warwicke is a subtle Orator:
1432   And {Lewis} a Prince soone wonne with mouing words:
1433   By this account then, {Margaret} may winne him,
1434   For she's a woman to be pittied much:
1435   Her sighes will make a batt'ry in his brest,
1436   Her teares will pierce into a Marble heart:
1437   The Tyger will be milde, whiles she doth mourne;
1438   And {Nero} will be tainted with remorse,
1439   To heare and see her plaints, her Brinish Teares.
1440   #I, but shee's come to begge, Warwicke to giue:
1441   Shee on his left side, crauing ayde for {Henrie};
1442   He on his right, asking a wife for {Edward}.
1443   Shee Weepes, and sayes, her {Henry} is depos'd:
1444   He Smiles, and sayes, his {Edward} is instaul'd;
1445  *That she (poore Wretch) for greefe can speake no more:
1446   Whiles Warwicke tels his Title, smooths the Wrong,
1447   Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
1448   And in conclusion winnes the King from her,
1449   With promise of his Sister, and what else,
1450   To strengthen and support King {Edwards} place.
1451   O {Margaret}, thus 'twill be, and thou (poore soule)
1452   Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorne.
1453  *<S {Hum}.> Say, what art thou talk'st of Kings & Queens?
1454  *<S {King}.> More then I seeme, and lesse then I was born to:
1455   A man at least, for lesse I should not be:
1456   And men may talke of Kings, and why not I?
1457   <S {Hum}.> #I, but thou talk'st, as if thou wer't a King.
1458   <S {King}.> Why so I am (in Minde) and that's enough.
1459   <S {Hum}.> But if thou be a King, where is thy Crowne?
1460   <S {King}.> My Crowne is in my heart, not on my head:
1461   Not deck'd with Diamonds, and Indian stones:
1462   Nor to be seene: my Crowne, is call'd Content,
1463   A Crowne it is, that sildome Kings enioy.
1464   <S {Hum}.> Well, if you be a King crown'd with Content,
1465   Your Crowne Content, and you, must be contented
1466   To go along with vs. For (as we thinke)
1467   You are the king King {Edward} hath depos'd:
1468   And we his subiects, sworne in all Allegeance,
1469   Will apprehend you, as his Enemie.
1470   <S {King}.> But did you neuer sweare, and breake an Oath.
1471   <S {Hum}.> No, neuer such an Oath, nor will not now.
1472  *<S {King}.> Where did you dwell when I was K[ing]. of England?
1473  *<S {Hum}.> Heere in this Country, where we now remaine.
1474   <S {King}.> I was annointed King at nine monthes old,
1475   My Father, and my Grandfather were Kings:
1476   And you were sworne true Subiects vnto me:
1477   And tell me then, haue you not broke your Oathes?
1478  *<S {Sin}.> No, for we were Subiects, but while you wer king
1479   <S {King}.> Why? Am I dead? Do I not breath a Man?
1480   Ah simple men, you know not what you sweare:
1481   Looke, as I blow this Feather from my Face,
1482   And as the Ayre blowes it to me againe,
1483   Obeying with my winde when I do blow,
1484   And yeelding to another, when it blowes,
1485   Commanded alwayes by the greater gust:
1486   Such is the lightnesse of you, common men.
1487   But do not breake your Oathes, for of that sinne,
1488   My milde intreatie shall not make you guiltie.
1489   Go where you will, the king shall be commanded,
1490   And be you kings, command, and Ile obey.
1491   <S {Sinklo}.> We are true Subiects to the king,
1492   King {Edward}.
1493   <S {King}.> So would you be againe to {Henrie},
1494   If he were seated as king {Edward} is.
1495   <S {Sinklo}.> We charge you in Gods name & the Kings,
1496   To go with vs vnto the Officers.
1497  *<S {King}.> In Gods name lead, your Kings name be obeyd,
1498   And what God will, that let your King performe.
1499   And what he will, I humbly yeeld vnto.  <D {Exeunt}>
1500   <D {Enter K[ing]. Edward, Gloster, Clarence, Lady Gray}.>
1501   <S {King}.> Brother of Gloster, at S[aint]. Albons field
      <P p4><C A>
1502   This Ladyes Husband, Sir {Richard Grey}, was slaine,
1503   His Land then seiz'd on by the Conqueror,
1504   Her suit is now, to repossesse those Lands,
1505   Which wee in Iustice cannot well deny,
1506   Because in Quarrell of the House of {Yorke},
1507   The worthy Gentleman did lose his Life.
1508  *<S {Rich}.> Your Highnesse shall doe well to graunt her suit:
1509   It were dishonor to deny it her.
1510   <S {King}.> It were no lesse, but yet Ile make a pawse.
1511   <S {Rich}.> Yea, is it so:
1512   I see the Lady hath a thing to graunt,
1513   Before the King will graunt her humble suit.
1514  *<S {Clarence}.> Hee knowes the Game, how true hee keepes
1515   the winde?
1516   <S {Rich}.> Silence.
1517   <S {King}.> Widow, we will consider of your suit,
1518   And come some other time to know our minde.
1519   <S {Wid}.> Right gracious Lord, I cannot brooke delay:
1520   May it please your Highnesse to resolue me now,
1521   And what your pleasure is, shall satisfie me.
1522   <S {Rich}.> #I Widow? then Ile warrant you all your Lands,
1523   #And if what pleases him, shall pleasure you:
1524   Fight closer, or good faith you'le catch a Blow.
1525   <S {Clarence}.> I feare her not, vnlesse she chance to fall.
1526   <S {Rich}.> God forbid that, for hee'le take vantages.
1527  *<S {King}.> How many Children hast thou, Widow? tell
1528   me.
1529   <S {Clarence}.> I thinke he meanes to begge a Child of her.
1530   <S {Rich}.> Nay then whip me: hee'le rather giue her two.
1531   <S {Wid}.> Three, my most gracious Lord.
1532  *<S {Rich}.> You shall haue foure, if you'le be rul'd by him.
1533  *<S {King}.> 'Twere pittie they should lose their Fathers
1534   Lands.
1535   <S {Wid}.> Be pittifull, dread Lord, and graunt it then.
1536  *<S {King}.> Lords giue vs leaue, Ile trye this Widowes
1537   wit.
1538  *<S {Rich}.> #I, good leaue haue you, for you will haue leaue,
1539   Till Youth take leaue, and leaue you to the Crutch.
1540  *<S {King}.> Now tell me, Madame, doe you loue your
1541   Children?
1542   <S {Wid}.> #I, full as dearely as I loue my selfe.
1543  *<S {King}.> And would you not doe much to doe them
1544   good?
1545  *<S {Wid}.> To doe them good, I would sustayne some
1546   harme.
1547  *<S {King}.> Then get your Husbands Lands, to doe them
1548   good.
1549   <S {Wid}.> Therefore I came vnto your Maiestie.
1550   <S {King}.> Ile tell you how these Lands are to be got.
1551   <S {Wid}.> So shall you bind me to your Highnesse seruice.
1552   <S {King}.> What seruice wilt thou doe me, if I giue them?
1553   <S {Wid}.> What you command, that rests in me to doe.
1554   <S {King}.> But you will take exceptions to my Boone.
1555   <S {Wid}.> No, gracious Lord, except I cannot doe it.
1556   <S {King}.> I, but thou canst doe what I meane to aske.
1557  *<S {Wid}.> Why then I will doe what your Grace com-mands.
1558  _
1559  *<S {Rich}.> Hee plyes her hard, and much Raine weares the
1560   Marble.
1561   <S {Clar}.> As red as fire? nay then, her Wax  must melt.
1562  *<S {Wid}.> Why stoppes my Lord? shall I not heare my
1563   Taske?
1564   <S {King}.> An easie Taske, 'tis but to loue a King.
1565  *<S {Wid}.> That's soone perform'd, because I am a Subiect.
1566  *<S {King}.> Why then, thy Husbands Lands I freely giue
1567   thee.
1568   <S {Wid}.> I take my leaue with many thousand thankes.
1569  *<S {Rich}.> The Match is made, shee seales it with a Cursie.
1570   <S {King}.> But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of loue I meane.
1571   <S {Wid}.> The fruits of Loue, I meane, my louing Liege.
1572   <S {King}.> #I, but I feare me in another sence.
1573   What Loue, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
1574  *<S {Wid}.> My loue till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,
1575   That loue which Vertue begges, and Vertue graunts.
1576   <S {King}.> No, by my troth, I did not meane such loue.
1577  *<S {Wid}.> Why then you meane not, as I thought you did.
1578   <S {King}.> But now you partly may perceiue my minde.
1579   <S {Wid}.> My minde will neuer graunt what I perceiue
1580   Your Highnesse aymes at, if I ayme aright.
1581   <S {King}.> To tell thee plaine, I ayme to lye with thee.
1582   <S {Wid}.> To tell you plaine, I had rather lye in Prison.
1583  *<S {King}.> Why then thou shalt not haue thy Husbands
1584   Lands.
1585   <S {Wid}.> Why then mine Honestie shall be my Dower,
1586   For by that losse, I will not purchase them.
1587  *<S {King}.> Therein thou wrong'st thy Children mightily.
1588  *<S {Wid}.> Herein your Highnesse wrongs both them & me:
1589   But mightie Lord, this merry inclination
1590   Accords not with the sadnesse of my suit:
1591   Please you dismisse me, eyther with #I, or no.
1592   <S {King}.> #I, if thou wilt say #I to my request:
1593   No, if thou do'st say No to my demand.
1594   <S {Wid}.> Then No, my Lord: my suit is at an end.
1595  *<S {Rich}.> The Widow likes him not, shee knits her
1596   Browes.
1597  *<S {Clarence}.> Hee is the bluntest Wooer in Christen-dome.
1598  _
1599  *<S {King}.> Her Looks doth argue her replete with Modesty,
1600   Her Words doth shew her Wit incomparable,
1601   All her perfections challenge Soueraigntie,
1602   One way, or other, shee is for a King,
1603   And shee shall be my Loue, or else my Queene.
1604   Say, that King {Edward} take thee for his Queene?
1605   <S {Wid}.> 'Tis better said then done, my gracious Lord:
1606   I am a subiect fit to ieast withall,
1607   But farre vnfit to be a Soueraigne.
1608   <S {King}.> Sweet Widow, by my State I sweare to thee,
1609   I speake no more then what my Soule intends,
1610   And that is, to enioy thee for my Loue.
1611   <S {Wid}.> And that is more then I will yeeld vnto:
1612   I know, I am too meane to be your Queene,
1613   And yet too good to be your Concubine.
1614   <S {King}.> You cauill, Widow, I did meane my Queene.
1615  *<S {Wid}.> 'Twill grieue your Grace, my Sonnes should call
1616   you Father.
1617   <S {King}.> No more, then when my Daughters
1618   Call thee Mother.
1619   Thou art a Widow, and thou hast some Children,
1620   And by Gods Mother, I being but a Batchelor,
1621   Haue other- some. Why, 'tis a happy thing,
1622   To be the Father vnto many Sonnes:
1623   Answer no more, for thou shalt be my Queene.
1624   <S {Rich}.> The Ghostly Father now hath done his Shrift.
1625  *<S {Clarence}.> When hee was made a Shriuer, 'twas for shift.
1626  *<S {King}.> Brothers, you muse what Chat wee two haue
1627   had.
1628  *<S {Rich}.> The Widow likes it not, for shee lookes very
1629   sad.
1630  *<S {King}.> You'ld thinke it strange, if I should marrie
1631   her.
1632   <S {Clarence}.> To who, my Lord?
1633   <S {King}.> Why {Clarence}, to my selfe.
      <P p4v>
1634   <S {Rich}.> That would be tenne dayes wonder at the least.
1635   <S {Clarence}.> That's a day longer then a Wonder lasts.
1636   <S {Rich}.> By so much is the Wonder in extremes.
1637   <S {King}.> Well, ieast on Brothers: I can tell you both,
1638   Her suit is graunted for her Husbands Lands.
1639   <D {Enter a Noble man}.>
1640   <S {Nob}.> My gracious Lord, {Henry} your Foe is taken,
1641   And brought your Prisoner to your Pallace Gate.
1642   <S {King}.> See that he be conuey'd vnto the Tower:
1643   And goe wee Brothers to the man that tooke him,
1644   To question of his apprehension.
1645   Widow goe you along: Lords vse her honourable.
1646   <D {Exeunt}.>
1647   <D {Manet Richard}.>
1648   <S {Rich}.> #I, {Edward} will vse Women honourably:
1649   Would he were wasted, Marrow, Bones, and all,
1650   That from his Loynes no hopefull Branch may spring,
1651   To crosse me from the Golden time I looke for:
1652   And yet, betweene my Soules desire, and me,
1653   The lustfull {Edwards} Title buryed,
1654   Is {Clarence}, {Henry}, and his Sonne young {Edward},
1655   And all the vnlook'd- for Issue of their Bodies,
1656   To take their Roomes, ere I can place my selfe:
1657   A cold premeditation for my purpose.
1658   Why then I doe but dreame on Soueraigntie,
1659   Like one that stands vpon a Promontorie,
1660   And spyes a farre- off shore, where hee would tread,
1661   Wishing his foot were equall with his eye,
1662   And chides the Sea, that sunders him from thence,
1663   Saying, hee'le lade it dry, to haue his way:
1664   So doe I wish the Crowne, being so farre off,
1665   And so I chide the meanes that keepes me from it,
1666   And so (I say) Ile cut the Causes off,
1667   Flattering me with impossibilities:
1668   My Eyes too quicke, my Heart o're- weenes too much,
1669   Vnlesse my Hand and Strength could equall them.
1670   Well, say there is no Kingdome then for {Richard}:
1671   What other Pleasure can the World affoord?
1672   Ile make my Heauen in a Ladies Lappe,
1673   And decke my Body in gay Ornaments,
1674   And 'witch sweet Ladies with my Words and Lookes.
1675   Oh miserable Thought! and more vnlikely,
1676   Then to accomplish twentie Golden Crownes.
1677   Why Loue forswore me in my Mothers Wombe:
1678   And for I should not deale in her soft Lawes,
1679   Shee did corrupt frayle Nature with some Bribe,
1680   To shrinke mine Arme vp like a wither'd Shrub,
1681   To make an enuious Mountaine on my Back,
1682   Where sits Deformitie to mocke my Body;
1683   To shape my Legges of an vnequall size,
1684   To dis- proportion me in euery part:
1685   Like to a Chaos, or an vn- lick'd Beare- whelpe,
1686   That carryes no impression like the Damme.
1687   And am I then a man to be belou'd?
1688   Oh monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought.
1689   Then since this Earth affoords no Ioy to me,
1690   But to command, to check, to o're- beare such,
1691   As are of better Person then my selfe:
1692   Ile make my Heauen, to dreame vpon the Crowne,
1693   And whiles I liue, t' account this World but #Hell,
1694   Vntill my mis- shap'd Trunke, that beares this Head,
1695   Be round impaled with a glorious Crowne.
1696   And yet I know not how to get the Crowne,
1697   For many Liues stand betweene me and home:
1698   And I, like one lost in a Thornie Wood,
1699   That rents the Thornes, and is rent with the Thornes,
1700   Seeking a way, and straying from the way,
1701   Not knowing how to finde the open Ayre,
1702   But toyling desperately to finde it out,
1703   Torment my selfe, to catch the English Crowne:
1704   And from that torment I will free my selfe,
1705   Or hew my way out with a bloody Axe.
1706   Why I can smile, and murther whiles I smile,
1707   And cry, Content, to that which grieues my Heart,
1708   And wet my Cheekes with artificiall Teares,
1709   And frame my Face to all occasions.
1710   Ile drowne more Saylers then the Mermaid shall,
1711   Ile slay more gazers then the Basiliske,
1712   Ile play the Orator as well as {Nestor},
1713   Deceiue more slyly then {Vlisses} could,
1714   And like a {Synon}, take another Troy.
1715   I can adde Colours to the Camelion,
1716   Change shapes with {Proteus}, for aduantages,
1717   And set the murtherous {Macheuill} to Schoole.
1718   Can I doe this, and cannot get a Crowne?
1719   Tut, were it farther off, Ile plucke it downe.  <D {Exit}.>
1720   <D {Flourish}.
1721   {Enter Lewis the French King, his Sister Bona, his}
1722   {Admirall, call'd Bourbon: Prince Edward},
1723   {Queene Margaret, and the Earle of Oxford}.
1724   {Lewis sits, and riseth vp againe}.>
1725   <S {Lewis}.> Faire Queene of England, worthy {Margaret},
1726   Sit downe with vs: it #ill befits thy State,
1727  *And Birth, that thou should'st stand, while {Lewis} doth sit.
1728   <S {Marg}.> No, mightie King of France: now {Margaret}
1729   Must strike her sayle, and learne #a while to serue,
1730   Where Kings command. I was (I must confesse)
1731   Great Albions Queene, in former Golden dayes:
1732   But now mischance hath trod my Title downe,
1733   And with dis- honor layd me on the ground,
1734   Where I must take like Seat vnto my fortune,
1735   And to my humble Seat conforme my selfe.
1736  *<S {Lewis}.> Why say, faire Queene, whence springs this
1737   deepe despaire?
1738  *<S {Marg}.> From such a cause, as fills mine eyes with teares,
1739   And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
1740   <S {Lewis}.> What ere it be, be thou still like thy selfe,
1741   And sit thee by our side.  <D {Seats her by him}.>
1742   Yeeld not thy necke to Fortunes yoake,
1743   But let thy dauntlesse minde still ride in triumph,
1744   Ouer all mischance.
1745   Be plaine, Queene {Margaret}, and tell thy griefe,
1746   It shall be eas'd, if France can yeeld reliefe.
1747   <S {Marg}.> Those gracious words
1748   Reuiue my drooping thoughts,
1749   And giue my tongue- ty'd sorrowes leaue to speake.
1750   Now therefore be it knowne to Noble {Lewis},
1751   That {Henry}, sole possessor of my Loue,
1752   Is, of a King, become a banisht man,
1753   And forc'd to liue in Scotland a Forlorne;
1754   While prowd ambitious {Edward}, Duke of Yorke,
1755   Vsurpes the Regall Title, and the Seat
1756   Of Englands true anoynted lawfull King.
1757   This is the cause that I, poore {Margaret},
1758   With this my Sonne, Prince {Edward}, {Henries} Heire,
1759   Am come to craue thy iust and lawfull ayde:
1760   And if thou faile vs, all our hope is done.
1761   Scotland hath #will to helpe, but cannot helpe:
      <P p5>
1762   Our People, and our Peeres, are both mis- led,
1763   Our Treasure seiz'd, our Souldiors put to flight,
1764   And (as thou seest) our selues in heauie plight.
1765   <S {Lewis}.> Renowned Queene,
1766   With patience calme the Storme,
1767   While we bethinke a meanes to breake it off.
1768  *<S {Marg}.> The more wee stay, the stronger growes our
1769   Foe.
1770   <S {Lewis}.> The more I stay, the more Ile succour thee.
1771   <S {Marg}.> O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
1772   And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow.
1773   <D {Enter Warwicke}.>
1774  *<S {Lewis}.> What's hee approacheth boldly to our pre-sence?
1775  _
1776  *<S {Marg}.> Our Earle of Warwicke, {Edwards} greatest
1777   Friend.
1778  *<S {Lewis}.> Welcome braue {Warwicke}, what brings thee
1779   to France?  <D {Hee descends. Shee ariseth}.>
1780   <S {Marg}.> #I now begins a second Storme to rise,
1781   For this is hee that moues both Winde and Tyde.
1782   <S {Warw}.> From worthy {Edward}, King of Albion,
1783   My Lord and Soueraigne, and thy vowed Friend,
1784   I come (in Kindnesse, and vnfayned Loue)
1785   First, to doe greetings to thy Royall Person,
1786   And then to craue a League of Amitie:
1787   And lastly, to confirme that Amitie
1788   With Nuptiall Knot, if thou vouchsafe to graunt
1789   That vertuous Lady {Bona}, thy faire Sister,
1790   To Englands King, in lawfull Marriage.
1791   <S {Marg}.> If that goe forward, {Henries} hope is done.
1792   <S {Warw}.> And gracious Madame,  <D {Speaking to Bona}.>
1793   In our Kings behalfe,
1794   I am commanded, with your leaue and fauor,
1795   Humbly to kisse your Hand, and with my Tongue
1796   To tell the passion of my Soueraignes Heart;
1797   Where Fame, late entring at his heedfull Eares,
1798   Hath plac'd thy Beauties Image, and thy Vertue.
1799   <S {Marg}.> King {Lewis}, and Lady {Bona}, heare me speake,
1800   Before you answer {Warwicke}.  His demand
1801   Springs not from {Edwards} well- meant honest Loue,
1802   But from Deceit, bred by Necessitie:
1803   For how can Tyrants safely gouerne home,
1804   Vnlesse abroad they purchase great allyance?
1805   To proue him Tyrant, this reason may suffice,
1806   That {Henry} liueth still: but were hee dead,
1807   Yet here Prince {Edward} stands, King {Henries} Sonne.
1808  *Looke therefore {Lewis}, that by this League and Mariage
1809   Thou draw not on thy Danger, and Dis- honor:
1810   For though Vsurpers sway the rule #a while,
1811   Yet Heau'ns are iust, and Time suppresseth Wrongs.
1812   <S {Warw}.> Iniurious {Margaret}.
1813   <S {Edw}.> And why not Queene?
1814   <S {Warw}.> Because thy Father {Henry} did vsurpe,
1815   And thou no more art Prince, then shee is Queene.
1816   <S {Oxf}.> Then {Warwicke} disanulls great {Iohn} of Gaunt,
1817   Which did subdue the greatest part of Spaine;
1818   And after {Iohn} of Gaunt, {Henry} the Fourth,
1819   Whose Wisdome was a Mirror to the wisest:
1820   And after that wise Prince, {Henry} the Fift,
1821   Who by his Prowesse conquered all France:
1822   From these, our {Henry} lineally descends.
1823   <S {Warw}.> {Oxford}, how haps it in this smooth discourse,
1824   You told not, how {Henry} the Sixt hath lost
1825   All that, which {Henry} the Fift had gotten:
1826   Me thinkes these Peeres of France should smile at that.
1827   But for the rest: you tell a Pedigree
1828   Of threescore and two yeeres, a silly time
1829   To make prescription for a Kingdomes worth.
1830  *<S {Oxf}.> Why {Warwicke}, canst thou speak against thy Liege,
1831   Whom thou obeyd'st thirtie and six yeeres,
1832   And not bewray thy Treason with a Blush?
1833   <S {Warw}.> Can {Oxford}, that did euer fence the right,
1834   Now buckler Falsehood with a Pedigree?
1835   For shame leaue {Henry}, and call {Edward} King.
1836   <S {Oxf}.> Call him my King, by whose iniurious doome
1837   My elder Brother, the Lord {Aubrey Vere}
1838   Was done to death? and more then so, my Father,
1839   Euen in the downe- fall of his mellow'd yeeres,
1840   When Nature brought him to the doore of Death?
1841   No {Warwicke}, no: while Life vpholds this Arme,
1842   This Arme vpholds the House of {Lancaster}.
1843   <S {Warw}.> And I the House of {Yorke}.
1844   <S {Lewis}.> Queene {Margaret}, Prince {Edward}, and {Oxford},
1845   Vouchsafe at our request, to stand aside,
1846   While I vse further conference with {Warwicke}.
1847   <D {They stand aloofe}.>
1848  *<S {Marg}.> Heauens graunt, that {Warwickes} wordes be-witch
1849   him not.
1850  *<S {Lew}.> Now {Warwicke}, tell me euen vpon thy conscience
1851   Is {Edward} your true King? for I were loth
1852   To linke with him, that were not lawfull chosen.
1853  *<S {Warw}.> Thereon I pawne my {Credit}, and mine Ho-nor.
1854  _
1855   <S {Lewis}.> But is hee gracious in the Peoples eye?
1856   <S {Warw}.> The more, that {Henry} was vnfortunate.
1857   <S {Lewis}.> Then further: all dissembling set aside,
1858   Tell me for truth, the measure of his Loue
1859   Vnto our Sister {Bona}.
1860   <S {War}.> Such it seemes,
1861   As may beseeme a Monarch like himselfe.
1862   My selfe haue often heard him say, and sweare,
1863   That this his Loue was an externall Plant,
1864   Whereof the Root was fixt in Vertues ground,
1865   The Leaues and Fruit maintain'd with Beauties Sunne,
1866   Exempt from Enuy, but not from Disdaine,
1867   Vnlesse the Lady {Bona} quit his paine.
1868   <S {Lewis}.> Now Sister, let vs heare your firme resolue.
1869   <S {Bona}.> Your graunt, or your denyall, shall be mine.
1870   Yet I confesse, that often ere this day,  <D {Speaks to War[wicke]}.>
1871   When I haue heard your Kings desert recounted,
1872   Mine eare hath tempted iudgement to desire.
1873   <S {Lewis}.> Then {Warwicke}, thus:
1874   Our Sister shall be {Edwards}.
1875   And now forthwith shall Articles be drawne,
1876   Touching the Ioynture that your King must make,
1877   Which with her Dowrie shall be counter- poys'd:
1878   Draw neere, Queene {Margaret}, and be a witnesse,
1879   That {Bona} shall be Wife to the English King.
1880   <S {Pr.Edw}.> To {Edward}, but not to the English King.
1881   <S {Marg}.> Deceitfull {Warwicke}, it was thy deuice,
1882   By this alliance to make void my suit:
1883   Before thy comming, {Lewis} was {Henries} friend.
1884   <S {Lewis}.> And still is friend to him, and {Margaret}.
1885   But if your Title to the Crowne by weake,
1886   As may appeare by {Edwards} good successe:
1887   Then 'tis but reason, that I be releas'd
1888   From giuing ayde, which late I promised.
1889   Yet shall you haue all kindnesse at my hand,
1890   That your Estate requires, and mine can yeeld.
1891   <S {Warw}.> {Henry} now liues in Scotland, at his ease;
      <P p5v><C B>
1892   Where hauing nothing, nothing can he lose.
1893   And as for you your selfe (our quondam Queene)
1894   You haue a Father able to maintaine you,
1895   And better 'twere, you troubled him, then France.
1896   <S {Mar}.> Peace impudent, and shamelesse Warwicke,
1897   Proud setter vp, and puller downe of Kings,
1898   I will not hence, till with my Talke and Teares
1899   (Both full of Truth) I make King {Lewis} behold
1900   Thy slye conueyance, and thy Lords false loue,
1901   <D {Post blowing a horne Within}.>
1902   For both of you are Birds of selfe- same Feather.
1903   <S {Lewes}.> Warwicke, this is some poste to vs, or thee.
1904   <D {Enter the Poste}.>
1905   <S {Post}.> My Lord Ambassador,
1906   These Letters are for you.  <D {Speakes to Warwick},>
1907   Sent from your Brother Marquesse {Montague}.
1908   These from our King, vnto your Maiesty.  <D {To Lewis}.>
1909   And Madam, these for you:  <D {To Margaret}>
1910   From whom, I know not.
1911   <D {They all reade their Letters}.>
1912   <S {Oxf}.> I like it well, that our faire Queene and Mistris
1913   Smiles at her newes, while {Warwicke} frownes at his.
1914  *<S {Prince} {Ed}.> Nay marke how {Lewis} stampes as he were
1915   netled. I hope, all's for the best.
1916   <S {Lew}.> Warwicke, what are thy Newes?
1917   And yours, faire Queene.
1918  *<S {Mar}.> Mine such, as fill my heart with vnhop'd ioyes.
1919   <S {War}.> Mine full of sorrow, and hearts discontent.
1920   <S {Lew}.> What? has your King married the Lady {Grey}?
1921   And now to sooth your Forgery, and his,
1922   Sends me a Paper to perswade me Patience?
1923   Is this th' Alliance that he seekes with France?
1924   Dare he presume to scorne vs in this manner?
1925   <S {Mar}.> I told your Maiesty as much before:
1926   This proueth {Edwards} Loue, and Warwickes honesty.
1927   <S {War}.> King {Lewis}, I heere protest in sight of heauen,
1928   And by the hope I haue of heauenly blisse,
1929   That I am cleere from this misdeed of {Edwards};
1930   No more my King, for he dishonors me,
1931   But most himselfe, if he could see his shame.
1932   Did I forget, that by the House of Yorke
1933   My Father came vntimely to his death?
1934   Did I let passe th' abuse done to my Neece?
1935   Did I impale him with the Regall Crowne?
1936   Did I put {Henry} from his Natiue Right?
1937   And am I guerdon'd at the last, with Shame?
1938   Shame on himselfe, for my Desert is Honor.
1939   And to repaire my Honor lost for him,
1940   I heere renounce him, and returne to {Henry}.
1941   My Noble Queene, let former grudges passe,
1942   And henceforth, I am thy true Seruitour:
1943   I will reuenge his wrong to Lady {Bona},
1944   And replant {Henry} in his former state.
1945   <S {Mar}.> Warwicke,
1946   These words haue turn'd my Hate, to Loue,
1947   And I forgiue, and quite forget old faults,
1948   And ioy that thou becom'st King {Henries} Friend.
1949   <S {War}.> So much his Friend, #I, his Vnfained Friend,
1950   That if King {Lewis} vouchsafe to furnish vs
1951   With some few Bands of chosen Soldiours,
1952   Ile vndertake to Land them on our Coast,
1953   And force the Tyrant from his seat by Warre.
1954   'Tis not his new- made Bride shall succour him.
1955   And as for {Clarence}, as my Letters tell me,
1956   Hee's very likely now to fall from him,
1957   For matching more for wanton Lust, then Honor,
1958   Or then for strength and safety of our Country.
1959   <S {Bona}.> Deere Brother, how shall {Bona} be reueng'd,
1960   But by thy helpe to this distressed Queene?
1961  *<S {Mar}.> Renowned Prince, how shall Poore {Henry} liue,
1962   Vnlesse thou rescue him from foule dispaire?
1963  *<S {Bona}.> My quarrel, and this English Queens, are one.
1964   <S {War}.> And mine faire Lady {Bona}, ioynes with yours.
1965   <S {Lew}.> And mine, with hers, and thine, and {Margarets}.
1966   Therefore, at last, I firmely am resolu'd
1967   You shall haue ayde.
1968   <S {Mar}.> Let me giue humble thankes for all, at once.
1969   <S {Lew}.> Then Englands Messenger, returne in Poste,
1970   And tell false {Edward}, thy supposed King,
1971   That {Lewis} of France, is sending ouer Maskers
1972   To reuell it with him, and his new Bride.
1973   Thou seest what's past, go feare thy King withall.
1974  *<S {Bona}.> Tell him, in hope hee'l proue a widower shortly,
1975   I weare the Willow Garland for his sake.
1976  *<S {Mar}.> Tell him, my mourning weeds are layde aside,
1977   And I am ready to put Armor on.
1978  *<S {War}.> Tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong,
1979   And therefore Ile vn- Crowne him, er't be long.
1980   There's thy reward, be gone.  <D {Exit Post}.>
1981   <S {Lew}.> But Warwicke,
1982   Thou and Oxford, with fiue thousand men
1983   Shall crosse the Seas, and bid false {Edward} battaile:
1984   And as occasion serues, this Noble Queen
1985   And Prince, shall follow with a fresh Supply.
1986   Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:
1987   What Pledge haue we of thy firme Loyalty?
1988   <S {War}.> This shall assure my constant Loyalty,
1989   That if our Queene, and this young Prince agree,
1990   Ile ioyne mine eldest daughter, and my Ioy,
1991   To him forthwith, in holy Wedlocke bands.
1992  *<S {Mar}.> Yes, I agree, and thanke you for your Motion.
1993   Sonne {Edward}, she is Faire and Vertuous,
1994   Therefore delay not, giue thy hand to Warwicke,
1995   And with thy hand, thy faith irreuocable,
1996   That onely Warwickes daughter shall be thine.
1997   <S {Prin.Ed}.> Yes, I accept her, for she well deserues it,
1998   And heere to pledge my Vow, I giue my hand.
1999   <D {He giues his hand to Warw[icke]}.>
2000  *<S {Lew}.> Why stay we now? These soldiers shalbe leuied,
2001   And thou Lord Bourbon, our High Admirall
2002   Shall waft them ouer with our Royall Fleete.
2003   I long till {Edward} fall by Warres mischance,
2004   For mocking Marriage with a Dame of France.
2005   <D {Exeunt. Manet Warwicke}.>
2006   <S {War}.> I came from {Edward} as Ambassador,
2007   But I returne his sworne and mortall Foe:
2008   Matter of Marriage was the charge he gaue me,
2009   But dreadfull Warre shall answer his demand.
2010   Had he none else to make a stale but me?
2011   Then none but I, shall turne his Iest to Sorrow.
2012   I was the Cheefe that rais'd him to the Crowne,
2013   And Ile be Cheefe to bring him downe againe:
2014   Not that I pitty {Henries} misery,
2015   But seeke Reuenge on {Edwards} mockery.  <D {Exit}.>
2016   <D {Enter Richard, Clarence, Somerset, and}
2017   {Mountague}.>
2018  *<S {Rich}.> Now tell me Brother {Clarence}, what thinke you
2019   Of this new Marriage with the Lady {Gray}?
2020   Hath not our Brother made a worthy choice?
2021   <S {Cla}.> Alas, you know, tis farre from hence to France,
      <P p6><C A>
2022   How could he stay till {Warwicke} made returne?
2023  *<S {Som}.> My Lords, forbeare this talke: heere comes the
2024   King.
2025   <D {Flourish}.
2026   {Enter King Edward, Lady Grey, Penbrooke, Staf-ford},
2027   {Hastings: foure stand on one side},
2028   {and foure on the other}.>
2029   <S {Rich}.> And his well- chosen Bride.
2030   <S {Clarence}.> I minde to tell him plainly what I thinke.
2031   <S {King}.> Now Brother of Clarence,
2032   How like you our Choyce,
2033   That you stand pensiue, as halfe malecontent?
2034   <S {Clarence}.> As well as {Lewis} of France,
2035   Or the Earle of Warwicke,
2036   Which are so weake of courage, and in iudgement,
2037   That they'le take no offence at our abuse.
2038   <S {King}.> Suppose they take offence without a cause:
2039   They are but {Lewis} and {Warwicke}, I am {Edward},
2040   Your King and {Warwickes}, and must haue my #will.
2041   <S {Rich}.> And shall haue your #will, because our King:
2042   Yet hastie Marriage seldome proueth well.
2043   <S {King}.> Yea, Brother {Richard}, are you offended too?
2044   <S {Rich}.> Not I: no:
2045   God forbid, that I should wish them seuer'd,
2046   Whom God hath ioyn'd together:
2047   #I, and 'twere pittie, to sunder them,
2048   That yoake so well together.
2049   <S {King}.> Setting your skornes, and your mislike aside,
2050   Tell me some reason, why the Lady {Grey}
2051   Should not become my Wife, and Englands Queene?
2052   And you too, {Somerset}, and {Mountague},
2053   Speake freely what you thinke.
2054   <S {Clarence}.> Then this is mine opinion:
2055   That King {Lewis} becomes your Enemie,
2056   For mocking him about the Marriage
2057   Of the Lady {Bona}.
2058  *<S {Rich}.> And {Warwicke}, doing what you gaue in charge,
2059   Is now dis- honored by this new Marriage.
2060   <S {King}.> What, if both {Lewis} and {Warwick} be appeas'd,
2061   By such inuention as I can deuise?
2062  *<S {Mount}.> Yet, to haue ioyn'd with France in such alliance,
2063  *Would more haue strength'ned this our Commonwealth
2064   'Gainst forraine stormes, then any home- bred Marriage.
2065   <S {Hast}.> Why, knowes not {Mountague}, that of it selfe,
2066   England is safe, if true within it selfe?
2067   <S {Mount}.> But the safer, when 'tis back'd with France.
2068   <S {Hast}.> 'Tis better vsing France, then trusting France:
2069   Let vs be back'd with God, and with the Seas,
2070   Which he hath giu'n for fence impregnable,
2071   And with their helpes, onely defend our selues:
2072   In them, and in our selues, our safetie lyes.
2073  *<S {Clar}.> For this one speech, Lord {Hastings} well deserues
2074   To haue the Heire of the Lord {Hungerford}.
2075   <S {King}.> #I, what of that? it was my #will, and graunt,
2076   And for this once, my #Will shall stand for Law.
2077  *<S {Rich}.> And yet me thinks, your Grace hath not done well,
2078   To giue the Heire and Daughter of Lord {Scales}
2079   Vnto the Brother of your louing Bride;
2080   Shee better would haue fitted me, or {Clarence}:
2081   But in your Bride you burie Brotherhood.
2082  *<S {Clar}.> Or else you would not haue bestow'd the Heire
2083   Of the Lord {Bonuill} on your new Wiues Sonne,
2084   And leaue your Brothers to goe speede elsewhere.
2085   <S {King}.> Alas, poore {Clarence}: is it for a Wife
2086   That thou art malecontent? I will prouide thee.
2087   <S {Clarence}.> In chusing for your selfe,
2088   You shew'd your iudgement:
2089   Which being shallow, you shall giue me leaue
2090   To play the Broker in mine owne behalfe;
2091   And to that end, I shortly minde to leaue you.
2092   <S {King}.> Leaue me, or tarry, {Edward} will be King,
2093   And not be ty'd vnto his Brothers #will.
2094   <S {Lady} {Grey}.> My Lords, before it pleas'd his Maiestie
2095   To rayse my State to Title of a Queene,
2096   Doe me but right, and you must all confesse,
2097   That I was not ignoble of Descent,
2098   And meaner then my selfe haue had like fortune.
2099   But as this Title honors me and mine,
2100   So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,
2101   Doth cloud my ioyes with danger, and with sorrow.
2102  *<S {King}.> My Loue, forbeare to fawne vpon their frownes:
2103   What danger, or what sorrow can befall thee,
2104   So long as {Edward} is thy constant friend,
2105   And their true Soueraigne, whom they must obey?
2106   Nay, whom they shall obey, and loue thee too,
2107   Vnlesse they seeke for hatred at my hands:
2108   Which if they doe, yet will I keepe thee safe,
2109   And they shall feele the vengeance of my wrath.
2110  *<S {Rich}.> I heare, yet say not much, but thinke the more.
2111   <D {Enter a Poste}.>
2112  *<S {King}.> Now Messenger, what Letters, or what Newes
2113   from France?
2114  *<S {Post}.> My Soueraigne Liege, no Letters, & few words,
2115   But such, as I (without your speciall pardon)
2116   Dare not relate.
2117   <S {King}.> Goe #too, wee pardon thee:
2118   Therefore, in briefe, tell me their words,
2119   As neere as thou canst guesse them.
2120   What answer makes King {Lewis} vnto our Letters?
2121   <S {Post}.> At my depart, these were his very words:
2122   Goe tell false {Edward}, the supposed King,
2123   That {Lewis} of France is sending ouer Maskers,
2124   To reuell it with him, and his new Bride.
2125  *<S {King}.> Is {Lewis} so braue? belike he thinkes me {Henry}.
2126   But what said Lady {Bona} to my Marriage?
2127  *<S {Post}.> These were her words, vtt'red with mild disdaine:
2128   Tell him, in hope hee'le proue a Widower shortly,
2129   Ile weare the Willow Garland for his sake.
2130   <S {King}.> I blame not her; she could say little lesse:
2131   She had the wrong. But what said {Henries} Queene?
2132   For I haue heard, that she was there in place.
2133   <S {Post}.> Tell him (quoth she)
2134   My mourning Weedes are done,
2135   And I am readie to put Armour on.
2136   <S {King}.> Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
2137   But what said {Warwicke} to these iniuries?
2138   <S {Post}.> He, more incens'd against your Maiestie,
2139   Then all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:
2140   Tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong,
2141   And therefore Ile vncrowne him, er't be long.
2142  *<S {King}.> Ha? durst the Traytor breath out so prowd words?
2143   Well, I will arme me, being thus fore- warn'd:
2144   They shall haue Warres, and pay for their presumption.
2145   But say, is {Warwicke} friends with {Margaret}?
2146   <S {Post}.> #I, gracious Soueraigne,
2147   They are so link'd in friendship,
2148   That yong Prince {Edward} marryes {Warwicks} Daughter.
2149   <S {Clarence}.> Belike, the elder;
2150   {Clarence} will haue the younger.
      <P p6v>
2151   Now Brother King farewell, and sit you fast,
2152   For I will hence to {Warwickes} other Daughter,
2153   That though I want a Kingdome, yet in Marriage
2154   I may not proue inferior to your selfe.
2155   You that loue me, and {Warwicke}, follow me.
2156   <D {Exit Clarence, and Somerset followes}.>
2157   <S {Rich}.> Not I:
2158   My thoughts ayme at a further matter:
2159   I stay not for the loue of {Edward}, but the Crowne.
2160   <S {King}.> {Clarence} and {Somerset} both gone to {Warwicke}?
2161   Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen:
2162   And haste is needfull in this desp'rate case.
2163   {Pembrooke} and {Stafford}, you in our behalfe
2164   Goe leuie men, and make prepare for Warre;
2165   They are alreadie, or quickly will be landed:
2166   My selfe in person will straight follow you.
2167   <D {Exeunt Pembrooke and Stafford}.>
2168   But ere I goe, {Hastings} and {Mountague}
2169   Resolue my doubt: you twaine, of all the rest,
2170   Are neere to {Warwicke}, by bloud, and by allyance:
2171   Tell me, if you loue {Warwicke} more then me;
2172   If it be so, then both depart to him:
2173   I rather wish you foes, then hollow friends.
2174   But if you minde to hold your true obedience,
2175   Giue me assurance with some friendly Vow,
2176   That I may neuer haue you in suspect.
2177  *<S {Mount}.> So God helpe {Mountague}, as hee proues
2178   true.
2179   <S {Hast}.> And {Hastings}, as hee fauours {Edwards} cause.
2180   <S {King}.> Now, Brother {Richard}, will you stand by vs?
2181   <S {Rich}.> #I, in despight of all that shall withstand you.
2182   <S {King}.> Why so: then am I sure of Victorie.
2183   Now therefore let vs hence, and lose no howre,
2184   Till wee meet {Warwicke}, with his forreine powre.
2185   <D {Exeunt}.>
2186   <D {Enter Warwicke and Oxford in England},
2187   {with French Souldiors}.>
2188   <S {Warw}.> Trust me, my Lord, all hitherto goes well,
2189   The common people by numbers swarme to vs.
2190   <D {Enter Clarence and Somerset}.>
2191   But see where {Somerset} and {Clarence} comes:
2192   Speake suddenly, my Lords, are wee all friends?
2193   <S {Clar}.> Feare not that, my Lord.
2194  *<S {Warw}.> Then gentle {Clarence}, welcome vnto {Warwicke},
2195   And welcome {Somerset}: I hold it cowardize,
2196   To rest mistrustfull, where a Noble Heart
2197   Hath pawn'd an open Hand, in signe of Loue;
2198   Else might I thinke, that {Clarence}, {Edwards} Brother,
2199   Were but a fained friend to our proceedings:
2200  *But welcome sweet {Clarence}, my Daughter shall be thine.
2201   And now, what rests? but in Nights Couerture,
2202   Thy Brother being carelessely encamp'd,
2203   His Souldiors lurking in the Towne about,
2204   And but attended by a simple Guard,
2205   Wee may surprize and take him at our pleasure,
2206   Our Scouts haue found the aduenture very easie:
2207   That as {Vlysses}, and stout {Diomede},
2208   With sleight and manhood stole to {Rhesus} Tents,
2209   And brought from thence the Thracian fatall Steeds;
2210   So wee, well couer'd with the Nights black Mantle,
2211   At vnawares may beat downe {Edwards} Guard,
2212   And seize himselfe: I say not, slaughter him,
2213   For I intend but onely to surprize him.
2214   You that will follow me to this attempt,
2215   Applaud the Name of {Henry}, with your Leader.
2216   <D {They all cry, Henry}.>
2217   Why then, let's on our way in silent sort,
2218   For {Warwicke} and his friends, God and Saint {George}.
2219   <D {Exeunt}.>
2220   <D {Enter three Watchmen to guard the Kings Tent}.>
2221  *<S 1.{Watch}.> Come on my Masters, each man take his stand,
2222   The King by this, is set him downe to sleepe.
2223   <S 2.{Watch}.> What, will he not to Bed?
2224  *<S 1.{Watch}.> Why, no: for he hath made a solemne Vow,
2225   Neuer to lye and take his naturall Rest,
2226   Till {Warwicke}, or himselfe, be quite supprest.
2227   <S 2.{Watch}.> To morrow then belike shall be the day,
2228   If {Warwicke} be so neere as men report.
2229   <S 3.{Watch}.> But say, I pray, what Noble man is that,
2230   That with the King here resteth in his Tent?
2231  *<S 1.{Watch}.> 'Tis the Lord {Hastings}, the Kings chiefest
2232   friend.
2233   <S 3.{Watch}.> O, is it so? but why commands the King,
2234   That his chiefe followers lodge in Townes about him,
2235   While he himselfe keepes in the cold field?
2236  *<S 2.{Watch}.> 'Tis the more honour, because more dange-rous.
2237  _
2238   <S 3.{Watch}.> #I, but giue me worship, and quietnesse,
2239   I like it better then a dangerous honor.
2240   If {Warwicke} knew in what estate he stands,
2241   'Tis to be doubted if he would waken him.
2242  *<S 1.{Watch}.> Vnlesse our Halberds did shut vp his pas-sage.
2243  _
2244   <S 2.{Watch}.> #I: wherefore else guard we his Royall Tent,
2245   But to defend his Person from Night- foes?
2246   <D {Enter Warwicke, Clarence, Oxford, Somerset},
2247   {and French Souldiors, silent all}.>
2248  *<S {Warw}.> This is his Tent, and see where stand his Guard:
2249   Courage my Masters: Honor now, or neuer:
2250   But follow me, and {Edward} shall be ours.
2251   <S 1.{Watch}.> Who goes there?
2252   <S 2.{Watch}.> Stay, or thou dyest.
2253  *<D {#Warwicke and the rest cry all, Warwicke, Warwicke},
2254  *{and set vpon the Guard, who flye, crying, Arme, Arme},
2255   {#Warwicke and the rest following them}.>
2256   <D {The Drumme playing, and Trumpet sounding}.
2257   {Enter Warwicke, Somerset, and the rest, bringing the King}
2258   {out in his Gowne, sitting in a Chaire: Richard}
2259   {and Hastings flyes ouer the Stage}.>
2260   <S {Som}.> What are they that flye there?
2261  *<S {Warw}.> {Richard} and {Hastings}: let them goe, heere is
2262   the Duke.
2263   <S {K.Edw}.> The Duke?
2264   Why {Warwicke}, when wee parted,
2265   Thou call'dst me King.
2266   <S {Warw}.> #I, but the case is alter'd.
2267   When you disgrac'd me in my Embassade,
2268   Then I degraded you from being King,
2269   And come now to create you Duke of Yorke.
2270   Alas, how should you gouerne any Kingdome,
2271   That know not how to vse Embassadors,
2272   Nor how to be contented with one Wife,
2273   Nor how to vse your Brothers Brotherly,
2274   Nor how to studie for the Peoples Welfare,
2275   Nor how to shrowd your selfe from Enemies?
      <P q1><C B>
2276   <S {K.Edw}.> Yea, Brother of Clarence,
2277   Art thou here too?
2278   Nay then I see, that {Edward} needs must downe.
2279   Yet {Warwicke}, in despight of all mischance,
2280   Of thee thy selfe, and all thy Complices,
2281   {#Edward} will alwayes beare himselfe as King:
2282   Though Fortunes mallice ouerthrow my State,
2283   My minde exceedes the compasse of her Wheele.
2284  *<S {Warw}.> Then for his minde, be {Edward} Englands King,
2285   <D {Takes off his Crowne}.>
2286   But {Henry} now shall weare the English Crowne,
2287   And be true King indeede: thou but the shadow.
2288   My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
2289   See that forthwith Duke {Edward} be conuey'd
2290   Vnto my Brother Arch- Bishop of Yorke:
2291   When I haue fought with {Pembrooke}, and his fellowes,
2292   Ile follow you, and tell what answer
2293   {#Lewis} and the Lady {Bona} send to him.
2294   Now for a- while farewell good Duke of Yorke.
2295   <D {They leade him out forcibly}.>
2296  *<S {K.Ed}.> What Fates impose, that men must needs abide;
2297   It boots not to resist both winde and tide.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2298   <S {Oxf}.> What now remaines my Lords for vs to do,
2299   But march to London with our Soldiers?
2300   <S {War}.> #I, that's the first thing that we haue to do,
2301   To free King {Henry} from imprisonment,
2302   And see him seated in the Regall Throne.  <D {Exit}.>
2303   <D {Enter Riuers, and Lady Gray}.>
2304   <S {Riu}.> Madam, what makes you in this sodain change?
2305   <S {Gray}.> Why Brother {Riuers}, are you yet to learne
2306   What late misfortune is befalne King {Edward}?
2307   <S {Riu}.> What losse of some pitcht battell
2308   Against {Warwicke}?
2309   <S {Gray}.> No, but the losse of his owne Royall person.
2310   <S {Riu}.> Then is my Soueraigne slaine?
2311   <S {Gray}.> #I almost slaine, for he is taken prisoner,
2312   Either betrayd by falshood of his Guard,
2313   Or by his Foe surpriz'd at vnawares:
2314   And as I further haue to vnderstand,
2315   Is new committed to the Bishop of Yorke,
2316   Fell Warwickes Brother, and by that our Foe.
2317   <S {Riu}.> These Newes I must confesse are full of greefe,
2318   Yet gracious Madam, beare it as you may,
2319   Warwicke may loose, that now hath wonne the day.
2320   <S {Gray}.> Till then, faire hope must hinder liues decay:
2321   And I the rather waine me from dispaire
2322   For loue of {Edwards} Off- spring in my wombe:
2323   This is it that makes me bridle passion,
2324   And beare with Mildnesse my misfortunes crosse:
2325   #I, #I, for this I draw in many a teare,
2326   And stop the rising of blood- sucking sighes,
2327   Least with my sighes or teares, I blast or drowne
2328   King {Edwards} Fruite, true heyre to th' English Crowne.
2329   <S {Riu}.> But Madam,
2330   Where is Warwicke then become?
2331  *<S {Gray}.> I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
2332   To set the Crowne once more on {Henries} head,
2333  *Guesse thou the rest, King {Edwards} Friends must downe.
2334   But to preuent the Tyrants violence,
2335   (For trust not him that hath once broken Faith)
2336   Ile hence forthwith vnto the Sanctuary,
2337   To saue (at least) the heire of {Edwards} right:
2338   There shall I rest secure from force and fraud:
2339   Come therefore let vs flye, while we may flye,
2340   If Warwicke take vs, we are sure to dye.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2341   <D {Enter Richard, Lord Hastings, and Sir William}
2342   {Stanley}.>
2343  *<S {Rich}.> Now my Lord {Hastings}, and Sir {William Stanley}
2344   Leaue off to wonder why I drew you hither,
2345   Into this cheefest Thicket of the Parke.
2346   Thus stand the case: you know our King, my Brother,
2347   Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands
2348   He hath good vsage, and great liberty,
2349   And often but attended with weake guard,
2350   Come hunting this way to disport himselfe.
2351   I haue aduertis'd him by secret meanes,
2352   That if about this houre he make this way,
2353   Vnder the colour of his vsuall game,
2354   He shall heere finde his Friends with Horse and Men,
2355   To set him free from his Captiuitie.
2356   <D {Enter King Edward, and a Huntsman}
2357   {with him}.>
2358   <S {Huntsman}.> This way my Lord,
2359   For this way lies the Game.
2360   <S {King Edw}.> Nay this way man,
2361   See where the Huntsmen stand.
2362   Now Brother of Gloster, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
2363   Stand you thus close to steale the Bishops Deere?
2364   <S {Rich}.> Brother, the time and case, requireth #hast,
2365   Your horse stands ready at the Parke- corner.
2366   <S {King} {Ed}.> But whether shall we then?
2367   <S {Hast}.> To Lyn my Lord,
2368   And shipt from thence to Flanders.
2369  *<S {Rich}.> Wel guest beleeue me, for that was my meaning
2370   <S {K.Ed}.> {Stanley}, I will requite thy forwardnesse.
2371   <S {Rich}.> But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talke.
2372   <S {K.Ed}.> Huntsman, what say'st thou?
2373   Wilt thou go along?
2374   <S {Hunts}.> Better do so, then tarry and be hang'd.
2375   <S {Rich}.> Come then away, lets ha no more adoo.
2376   <S {K.Ed}.> Bishop farwell,
2377   Sheeld thee from {Warwickes} frowne,
2378   And pray that I may re- possesse the Crowne.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2379  *<D {Flourish. Enter King Henry the sixt, Clarence, Warwicke},
2380   {Somerset, young Henry, Oxford, Mountague},
2381   {and Lieutenant}.>
2382   <S {K.Hen}.> M[aster]. Lieutenant, now that God and Friends
2383   Haue shaken {Edward} from the Regall seate,
2384   And turn'd my captiue state to libertie,
2385   My feare to hope, my sorrowes vnto ioyes,
2386   At our enlargement what are thy due Fees?
2387  *<S {Lieu}.> Subiects may challenge nothing of their Sou'rains
2388   But, if an humble prayer may preuaile,
2389   I then craue pardon of your Maiestie.
2390   <S {K.Hen}.> For what, Lieutenant? For well vsing me?
2391   Nay, be thou sure, Ile well requite thy kindnesse.
2392   For that it made my imprisonment, a pleasure:
2393   #I, such a pleasure, as incaged Birds
2394   Conceiue; when after many moody Thoughts,
2395   At last, by Notes of Houshold harmonie,
2396   They quite forget their losse of Libertie.
      <P q1v><C A>
2397   But {Warwicke}, after God, thou set'st me free,
2398   And chiefely therefore, I thanke God, and thee,
2399   He was the Author, thou the Instrument.
2400   Therefore that I may conquer Fortunes spight,
2401   By liuing low, where Fortune cannot hurt me,
2402   And that the people of this blessed Land
2403   May not be punisht with my thwarting starres,
2404   {#Warwicke}, although my Head still weare the Crowne,
2405   I here resigne my Gouernment to thee,
2406   For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
2407  *<S {Warw}.> Your Grace hath still beene fam'd for vertuous,
2408   And now may seeme as wise as vertuous,
2409   By spying and auoiding Fortunes malice,
2410   For few men rightly temper with the Starres:
2411   Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace,
2412   For chusing me, when {Clarence} is in place.
2413   <S {Clar}.> No {Warwicke}, thou art worthy of the sway,
2414   To whom the Heau'ns in thy Natiuitie,
2415   Adiudg'd an Oliue Branch, and Lawrell Crowne,
2416   As likely to be blest in Peace and Warre:
2417   And therefore I yeeld thee my free consent.
2418   <S {Warw}.> And I chuse {Clarence} onely for Protector.
2419  *<S {King}.> {Warwick} and {Clarence}, giue me both your Hands:
2420  *Now ioyne your Hands, & with your Hands your Hearts,
2421   That no dissention hinder Gouernment:
2422   I make you both Protectors of this Land,
2423   While I my selfe will lead a priuate Life,
2424   And in deuotion spend my latter dayes,
2425   To sinnes rebuke, and my Creators prayse.
2426  *<S {Warw}.> What answeres {Clarence} to his Soueraignes
2427   #will?
2428   <S {Clar}.> That he consents, if {Warwicke} yeeld consent,
2429   For on thy fortune I repose my selfe.
2430   <S {Warw}.> Why then, though loth, yet must I be content:
2431   Wee'le yoake together, like a double shadow
2432   To {Henries} Body, and supply his place;
2433   I meane, in bearing weight of Gouernment,
2434   While he enioyes the Honor, and his ease.
2435   And {Clarence}, now then it is more then needfull,
2436   Forthwith that {Edward} be pronounc'd a Traytor,
2437   And all his Lands and Goods confiscate.
2438  *<S {Clar}.> What else? and that Succession be determined.
2439   <S {Warw}.> #I, therein {Clarence} shall not want his part.
2440   <S {King}.> But with the first, of all your chiefe affaires,
2441   Let me entreat (for I command no more)
2442   That {Margaret} your Queene, and my Sonne {Edward},
2443   Be sent for, to returne from France with speed:
2444   For till I see them here, by doubtfull feare,
2445   My ioy of libertie is halfe eclips'd.
2446  *<S {Clar}.> It shall bee done, my Soueraigne, with all
2447   speede.
2448   <S {King}.> My Lord of Somerset, what Youth is that,
2449   Of whom you seeme to haue so tender care?
2450  *<S {Somers}.> My Liege, it is young {Henry}, Earle of Rich-mond.
2451  _
2452   <S {King}.> Come hither, Englands Hope:
2453   <D {Layes his Hand on his Head}.>
2454   If secret Powers suggest but truth
2455   To my diuining thoughts,
2456   This prettie Lad will proue our Countries blisse.
2457   His Lookes are full of peacefull Maiestie,
2458   His Head by nature fram'd to weare a Crowne,
2459   His Hand to wield a Scepter, and himselfe
2460   Likely in time to blesse a Regall Throne:
2461   Make much of him, my Lords; for this is hee
2462   Must helpe you more, then you are hurt by mee.
2463   <D {Enter a Poste}.>
2464   <S {Warw}.> What newes, my friend?
2465   <S {Poste}.> That {Edward} is escaped from your Brother,
2466   And fled (as hee heares since) to Burgundie.
2467   <S {Warw}.> Vnsauorie newes: but how made he escape?
2468   <S {Poste}.> He was conuey'd by {Richard}, Duke of Gloster,
2469   And the Lord {Hastings}, who attended him
2470   In secret ambush, on the Forrest side,
2471   And from the Bishops Huntsmen rescu'd him:
2472   For Hunting was his dayly Exercise.
2473   <S {Warw}.> My Brother was too carelesse of his charge.
2474   But let vs hence, my Soueraigne, to prouide
2475   A salue for any sore, that may betide.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2476   <D {Manet Somerset, Richmond, and Oxford}.>
2477   <S {Som}.> My Lord, I like not of this flight of {Edwards}:
2478   For doubtlesse, {Burgundie} will yeeld him helpe,
2479   And we shall haue more Warres befor't be long.
2480   As {Henries} late presaging Prophecie
2481   Did glad my heart, with hope of this young {Richmond}:
2482   So doth my heart mis- giue me, in these Conflicts,
2483   What may befall him, to his harme and ours.
2484   Therefore, Lord {Oxford}, to preuent the worst,
2485   Forthwith wee'le send him hence to Brittanie,
2486   Till stormes be past of Ciuill Enmitie.
2487   <S {Oxf}.> #I: for if {Edward} re- possesse the Crowne,
2488   'Tis like that {Richmond}, with the rest, shall downe.
2489   <S {Som}.> It shall be so: he shall to Brittanie.
2490   Come therefore, let's about it speedily.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2491   <D {Flourish. Enter Edward, Richard, Hastings},
2492   {and Souldiers}.>
2493  *<S {Edw}.> Now Brother {Richard}, Lord {Hastings}, and the rest,
2494   Yet thus farre Fortune maketh vs amends,
2495   And sayes, that once more I shall enterchange
2496   My wained state, for {Henries} Regall Crowne.
2497   Well haue we pass'd, and now re- pass'd the Seas,
2498   And brought desired helpe from Burgundie.
2499   What then remaines, we being thus arriu'd
2500   From Rauenspurre Hauen, before the Gates of Yorke,
2501   But that we enter, as into our Dukedome?
2502   <S {Rich}.> The Gates made fast?
2503   Brother, I like not this.
2504   For many men that stumble at the Threshold,
2505   Are well fore- told, that danger lurkes within.
2506  *<S {Edw}.> Tush man, aboadments must not now affright vs:
2507   By faire or foule meanes we must enter in,
2508   For hither will our friends repaire to vs.
2509  *<S {Hast}.> My Liege, Ile knocke once more, to summon
2510   them.
2511   <D {Enter on the Walls, the Maior of Yorke},
2512   {and his Brethren}.>
2513   <S {Maior}.> My Lords,
2514   We were fore- warned of your comming,
2515   And shut the Gates, for safetie of our selues;
2516   For now we owe allegeance vnto {Henry}.
2517   <S {Edw}.> But, Master Maior, if {Henry} be your King,
2518   Yet {Edward}, at the least, is Duke of Yorke.
2519  *<S {Maior}.> True, my good Lord, I know you for no
2520   lesse.
2521  *<S {Edw}.> Why, and I challenge nothing but my Dukedome,
2522   As being well content with that alone.
      <P q2>
2523   <S {Rich}.> But when the Fox hath once got in his Nose,
2524   Hee'le soone finde meanes to make the Body follow.
2525  *<S {Hast}.> Why, Master Maior, why stand you in a doubt?
2526   Open the Gates, we are King {Henries} friends.
2527  *<S {Maior}.> #I, say you so? the Gates shall then be opened.
2528   <D {He descends}.>
2529   <S {Rich}.> A wise stout Captaine, and soone perswaded.
2530  *<S {Hast}.> The good old man would faine that all were wel,
2531   So 'twere not long of him: but being entred,
2532   I doubt not I, but we shall soone perswade
2533   Both him, and all his Brothers, vnto reason.
2534   <D {Enter the Maior, and two Aldermen}.>
2535  *<S {Edw}.> So, Master Maior: these Gates must not be shut,
2536   But in the Night, or in the time of Warre.
2537   What, feare not man, but yeeld me vp the Keyes,
2538   <D {Takes his Keyes}.>
2539   For {Edward} will defend the Towne, and thee,
2540   And all those friends, that deine to follow mee.
2541   <D {March. Enter Mountgomerie, with Drumme}
2542   {and Souldiers}.>
2543   <S {Rich}.> Brother, this is Sir {Iohn Mountgomerie},
2544   Our trustie friend, vnlesse I be deceiu'd.
2545  *<S {Edw}.> Welcome Sir {Iohn}: but why come you in
2546   Armes?
2547  *<S {Mount}.> To helpe King {Edward} in his time of storme,
2548   As euery loyall Subiect ought to doe.
2549   <S {Edw}.> Thankes good {Mountgomerie}:
2550   But we now forget our Title to the Crowne,
2551   And onely clayme our Dukedome,
2552   Till God please to send the rest.
2553   <S {Mount}.> Then fare you well, for I will hence againe,
2554   I came to serue a King, and not a Duke:
2555   Drummer strike vp, and let vs march away.
2556   <D {The Drumme begins to march}.>
2557   <S {Edw}.> Nay stay, Sir {Iohn}, #a while, and wee'le debate
2558   By what safe meanes the Crowne may be recouer'd.
2559  *<S {Mount}.> What talke you of debating? in few words,
2560   If you'le not here proclaime your selfe our King,
2561   Ile leaue you to your fortune, and be gone,
2562   To keepe them back, that come to succour you.
2563   Why shall we fight, if you pretend no Title?
2564  *<S {Rich}.> Why Brother, wherefore stand you on nice
2565   points?
2566   <S {Edw}.> When wee grow stronger,
2567   Then wee'le make our Clayme:
2568   Till then, 'tis wisdome to conceale our meaning.
2569  *<S {Hast}.> Away with scrupulous Wit, now Armes must
2570   rule.
2571  *<S {Rich}.> And fearelesse minds clyme soonest vnto Crowns.
2572   Brother, we will proclaime you out of hand,
2573   The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
2574   <S {Edw}.> Then be it as you will: for 'tis my right,
2575   And {Henry} but vsurpes the Diademe.
2576  *<S {Mount}.> #I, now my Soueraigne speaketh like himselfe,
2577   And now will I be {Edwards} Champion.
2578  *<S {Hast}.> Sound Trumpet, {Edward} shal be here proclaim'd:
2579   Come, fellow Souldior, make thou proclamation.
2580   <D {Flourish. Sound}.>
2581  *<S {Soul}.> Edward {the Fourth, by the Grace of God, King of}
2582   {England and France, and Lord of Ireland, &c}.
2583  *<S {Mount}.> And whosoe're gainsayes King {Edwards} right,
2584   By this I challenge him to single fight.
2585   <D {Throwes downe his Gauntlet}.>
2586   <S {All}.> Long liue {Edward} the Fourth.
2587   <S {Edw}.> Thankes braue {Mountgomery},
2588   And thankes vnto you all:
2589   If fortune serue me, Ile requite this kindnesse.
2590   Now for this Night, let's harbor here in Yorke:
2591   And when the Morning Sunne shall rayse his Carre
2592   Aboue the Border of this Horizon,
2593   Wee'le forward towards {Warwicke}, and his Mates;
2594   For well I wot, that {Henry} is no Souldier.
2595   Ah froward {Clarence}, how euill it beseemes thee,
2596   To flatter {Henry}, and forsake thy Brother?
2597   Yet as wee may, wee'le meet both thee and {Warwicke}.
2598   Come on braue Souldiors: doubt not of the Day,
2599   And that once gotten, doubt not of large Pay.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2600   <D {Flourish. Enter the King, Warwicke, Mountague},
2601   {Clarence, Oxford, and Somerset}.>
2602   <S {War}.> What counsaile, Lords? {Edward} from Belgia,
2603   With hastie Germanes, and blunt Hollanders,
2604   Hath pass'd in safetie through the Narrow Seas,
2605   And with his troupes doth march amaine to London,
2606   And many giddie people flock to him.
2607   <S {King}.> Let's leuie men, and beat him backe againe.
2608   <S {Clar}.> A little fire is quickly trodden out,
2609   Which being suffer'd, Riuers cannot quench.
2610   <S {War}.> In Warwickshire I haue true- hearted friends,
2611   Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in Warre,
2612   Those will I muster vp: and thou Sonne {Clarence}
2613   Shalt stirre vp in Suffolke, Norfolke, and in Kent,
2614   The Knights and Gentlemen, to come with thee.
2615   Thou Brother {Mountague}, in Buckingham,
2616   Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find
2617   Men well enclin'd to heare what thou command'st.
2618   And thou, braue {Oxford}, wondrous well belou'd,
2619   In Oxfordshire shalt muster vp thy friends.
2620   My Soueraigne, with the louing Citizens,
2621   Like to his Iland, gyrt in with the Ocean,
2622   Or modest {Dyan}, circled with her Nymphs,
2623   Shall rest in London, till we come to him:
2624   Faire Lords take leaue, and stand not to reply.
2625   Farewell my Soueraigne.
2626   <S {King}.> Farewell my {Hector}, and my Troyes true hope.
2627   <S {Clar}.> In signe of truth, I kisse your Highnesse Hand.
2628   <S {King}.> Well- minded {Clarence}, be thou fortunate.
2629   <S {Mount}.> Comfort, my Lord, and so I take my leaue.
2630   <S {Oxf}.> And thus I seale my truth, and bid adieu.
2631   <S {King}.> Sweet {Oxford}, and my louing {Mountague},
2632   And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
2633   <S {War}.> Farewell, sweet Lords, let's meet at Couentry.
2634   <D {Exeunt}.>
2635   <S {King}.> Here at the Pallace will I rest #a while.
2636   Cousin of {Exeter}, what thinkes your Lordship?
2637   Me thinkes, the Power that {Edward} hath in field,
2638   Should not be able to encounter mine.
2639   <S {Exet}.> The doubt is, that he will seduce the rest.
2640  *<S {King}.> That's not my feare, my meed hath got me fame:
2641   I haue not stopt mine eares to their demands,
2642   Nor posted off their suites with slow delayes,
2643   My pittie hath beene balme to heale their wounds,
2644   My mildnesse hath allay'd their swelling griefes,
2645   My mercie dry'd their water- flowing teares.
2646   I haue not been desirous of their wealth,
2647   Nor much opprest them with great Subsidies,
2648   Nor forward of reuenge, though they much err'd.
2649   Then why should they loue {Edward} more then me?
2650   No {Exeter}, these Graces challenge Grace:
      <P q2v>
2651   And when the Lyon fawnes vpon the Lambe,
2652   The Lambe will neuer cease to follow him.
2653   <D {Shout within, A Lancaster, A Lancaster}.>
2654  *<S {Exet}.> Hearke, hearke, my Lord, what Shouts are
2655   these?
2656   <D {Enter Edward and his Souldiers}.>
2657  *<S {Edw}.> Seize on the shamefac'd {Henry}, beare him hence,
2658   And once againe proclaime vs King of England.
2659   You are the Fount, that makes small Brookes to flow,
2660   Now stops thy Spring, my Sea shall suck them dry,
2661   And swell so much the higher, by their ebbe.
2662   Hence with him to the Tower, let him not speake.
2663   <D {Exit with King Henry}.>
2664   And Lords, towards Couentry bend we our course,
2665   Where peremptorie {Warwicke} now remaines:
2666   The Sunne shines hot, and if we vse delay,
2667   Cold biting Winter marres our hop'd- for Hay.
2668   <S {Rich}.> Away betimes, before his forces ioyne,
2669   And take the great- growne Traytor vnawares:
2670   Braue Warriors, march amaine towards Couentry.
2671   <D {Exeunt}.>
2672   <D {Enter Warwicke, the Maior of Couentry, two}
2673   {Messengers, and others vpon the Walls}.>
2674  *<S {War}.> Where is the Post that came from valiant {Oxford}?
2675   How farre hence is thy Lord, mine honest fellow?
2676   <S {Mess}>.1. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
2677   <S {War}.> How farre off is our Brother {Mountague}?
2678   Where is the Post that came from {Mountague}?
2679   <S {Mess}.>2. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troope.
2680   <D {Enter Someruile}.>
2681   <S {War}.> Say {Someruile}, what sayes my louing Sonne?
2682   And by thy guesse, how nigh is {Clarence} now?
2683   <S {Someru}.> At Southam I did leaue him with his forces,
2684   And doe expect him here some two howres hence.
2685   <S {War}.> Then {Clarence} is at hand, I heare his Drumme.
2686   <S {Someru}.> It is not his, my Lord, here Southam lyes:
2687   The Drum your Honor heares, marcheth from {Warwicke}.
2688  *<S {War}.> Who should that be? belike vnlook'd for friends.
2689  *<S {Someru}.> They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
2690   <D {March. Flourish. Enter Edward, Richard},
2691   {and Souldiers}.>
2692  *<S {Edw}.> Goe, Trumpet, to the Walls, and sound a Parle.
2693   <S {Rich}.> See how the surly {Warwicke} mans the Wall.
2694   <S {War}.> Oh vnbid spight, is sportfull {Edward} come?
2695   Where slept our Scouts, or how are they seduc'd,
2696   That we could heare no newes of his repayre.
2697   <S {Edw}.> Now {Warwicke}, wilt thou ope the Citie Gates,
2698   Speake gentle words, and humbly bend thy Knee,
2699   Call {Edward} King, and at his hands begge Mercy,
2700   #And he shall pardon thee these Outrages?
2701   <S {War}.> Nay rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
2702   Confesse who set thee vp, and pluckt thee downe,
2703   Call {Warwicke} Patron, and be penitent,
2704   And thou shalt still remaine the Duke of Yorke.
2705   <S {Rich}.> I thought at least he would haue said the King,
2706   Or did he make the Ieast against his #will?
2707   <S {War}.> Is not a Dukedome, Sir, a goodly gift?
2708   <S {Rich}.> #I, by my faith, for a poore Earle to giue,
2709   Ile doe thee seruice for so good a gift.
2710  *<S {War}.> 'Twas I that gaue the Kingdome to thy Bro-ther.
2711  _
2712   <S {Edw}.> Why then 'tis mine, if but by {Warwickes} gift.
2713   <S {War}.> Thou art no {Atlas} for so great a weight:
2714   And Weakeling, {Warwicke} takes his gift againe,
2715   And {Henry} is my King, {Warwicke} his Subiect.
2716   <S {Edw}.> But {Warwickes} King is {Edwards} Prisoner:
2717   And gallant {Warwicke}, doe but answer this,
2718   What is the Body, when the Head is off?
2719   <S {Rich}.> Alas, that {Warwicke} had no more fore- cast,
2720   But whiles he thought to steale the single Ten,
2721   The King was slyly finger'd from the Deck:
2722   You left poore {Henry} at the Bishops Pallace,
2723   And tenne to one you'le meet him in the Tower.
2724   <S {Edw}.> 'Tis euen so, yet you are {Warwicke} still.
2725   <S {Rich}.> Come {Warwicke},
2726   Take the time, kneele downe, kneele downe:
2727   Nay when? strike now, or else the Iron cooles.
2728   <S {War}.> I had rather chop this Hand off at a blow,
2729   And with the other, fling it at thy face,
2730   Then beare so low a sayle, to strike to thee.
2731   <S {Edw}.> Sayle how thou canst,
2732   Haue Winde and Tyde thy friend,
2733   This Hand, fast wound about thy coale- black hayre,
2734   Shall, whiles thy Head is warme, and new cut off,
2735   Write in the dust this Sentence with thy blood,
2736   Wind- changing {Warwicke} now can change no more.
2737   <D {Enter Oxford, with Drumme and Colours}.>
2738  *<S {War}.> Oh chearefull Colours, see where {Oxford} comes.
2739   <S {Oxf}.> {Oxford}, {Oxford}, for {Lancaster}.
2740   <S {Rich}.> The Gates are open, let vs enter too.
2741   <S {Edw}.> So other foes may set vpon our backs.
2742   Stand we in good array: for they no doubt
2743   Will issue out againe, and bid vs battaile;
2744   If not, the Citie being but of small defence,
2745   Wee'le quickly rowze the Traitors in the same.
2746   <S {War}.> Oh welcome {Oxford}, for we want thy helpe.
2747   <D {Enter Mountague, with Drumme and Colours}.>
2748   <S {Mount}.> {Mountague}, {Mountague}, for {Lancaster}.
2749  *<S {Rich}.> Thou and thy Brother both shall buy this Treason
2750   Euen with the dearest blood your bodies beare.
2751   <S {Edw}.> The harder matcht, the greater Victorie,
2752   My minde presageth happy gaine, and Conquest.
2753   <D {Enter Somerset, with Drumme and Colours}.>
2754   <S {Som}.> {Somerset}, {Somerset}, for {Lancaster}.
2755   <S {Rich}.> Two of thy Name, both Dukes of Somerset,
2756   Haue sold their Liues vnto the House of {Yorke},
2757   And thou shalt be the third, if this Sword hold.
2758   <D {Enter Clarence, with Drumme and Colours}.>
2759  *<S {War}.> And loe, where {George} of Clarence sweepes along,
2760   Of force enough to bid his Brother Battaile:
2761   With whom, in vpright zeale to right, preuailes
2762   More then the nature of a Brothers Loue.
2763   Come {Clarence}, come: thou wilt, if {Warwicke} call.
2764  *<S {Clar}.> Father of Warwicke, know you what this meanes?
2765   Looke here, I throw my infamie at thee:
2766   I will not ruinate my Fathers House,
2767   Who gaue his blood to lyme the stones together,
2768   And set vp {Lancaster}. Why, trowest thou, {Warwicke},
2769   That {Clarence} is so harsh, so blunt, vnnaturall,
2770   To bend the fatall Instruments of Warre
      <P q3>
2771   Against his Brother, and his lawfull King.
2772   Perhaps thou wilt obiect my holy Oath:
2773   To keepe that Oath, were more impietie,
2774   Then {Iephah}, when he sacrific'd his Daughter.
2775   I am so sorry for my Trespas made,
2776   That to deserue well at my Brothers hands,
2777   I here proclayme my selfe thy mortall foe:
2778   With resolution, wheresoe're I meet thee,
2779   (As I will meet thee, if thou stirre abroad)
2780   To plague thee, for thy foule mis- leading me.
2781   And so, prowd- hearted {Warwicke}, I defie thee,
2782   And to my Brother turne my blushing Cheekes.
2783   Pardon me {Edward}, I will make amends:
2784   And {Richard}, doe not frowne vpon my faults,
2785   For I will henceforth be no more vnconstant.
2786  *<S {Edw}.> Now welcome more, and ten times more belou'd,
2787   Then if thou neuer hadst deseru'd our hate.
2788   <S {Rich}.> Welcome good {Clarence}, this is Brother- like.
2789   <S {Warw}.> Oh passing Traytor, periur'd and vniust.
2790   <S {Edw}.> What {Warwicke},
2791   Wilt thou leaue the Towne, and fight?
2792   Or shall we beat the Stones about thine Eares?
2793   <S {Warw}.> Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence:
2794   I will away towards Barnet presently,
2795   And bid thee Battaile, {Edward}, if thou dar'st.
2796  *<S {Edw}.> Yes {Warwicke}, {Edward} dares, and leads the way:
2797   Lords to the field: Saint {George}, and Victorie. <D {Exeunt}.>
2798   <D {March. Warwicke and his companie followes}.>
2799   <D {Alarum, and Excursions. Enter Edward bringing}
2800   {forth Warwicke wounded}.>
2801   <S {Edw}.> So, lye thou there: dye thou, and dye our feare,
2802   For {Warwicke} was a Bugge that fear'd vs all.
2803   Now {Mountague} sit fast, I seeke for thee,
2804   That {Warwickes} Bones may keepe thine companie.
2805   <D {Exit}.>
2806   <S {Warw}.> Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend, or foe,
2807   And tell me who is Victor, {Yorke}, or {Warwicke}?
2808   Why aske I that? my mangled body shewes,
2809   My blood, my want of strength, my sicke heart shewes,
2810   That I must yeeld my body to the Earth,
2811   And by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
2812   Thus yeelds the Cedar to the Axes edge,
2813   Whose Armes gaue shelter to the Princely Eagle,
2814   Vnder whose shade the ramping Lyon slept,
2815   Whose top- branch ouer- peer'd {Ioues} spreading Tree,
2816   And kept low Shrubs from Winters pow'rfull Winde.
2817  *These Eyes, that now are dim'd with Deaths black Veyle,
2818   Haue beene as piercing as the Mid- day Sunne,
2819   To search the secret Treasons of the World:
2820   The Wrinckles in my Browes, now fill'd with blood,
2821   Were lik'ned oft to Kingly Sepulchers:
2822   For who liu'd King, but I could digge his Graue?
2823   And who durst smile, when {Warwicke} bent his Brow?
2824   Loe, now my Glory smear'd in dust and blood.
2825   My Parkes, my Walkes, my Mannors that I had,
2826   Euen now forsake me; and of all my Lands,
2827   Is nothing left me, but my bodies length.
2828   Why, what is Pompe, Rule, Reigne, but Earth and Dust?
2829   And liue we how we can, yet dye we must.
2830   <D {Enter Oxford and Somerset}.>
2831   <S {Som}.> Ah {Warwicke}, {Warwicke}, wert thou as we are,
2832   We might recouer all our Losse againe:
2833  *The Queene from France hath brought a puissant power.
2834   Euen now we heard the newes: ah, could'st thou flye.
2835   <S {Warw}.> Why then I would not flye. Ah {Mountague},
2836   If thou be there, sweet Brother, take my Hand,
2837   And with thy Lippes keepe in my Soule #a while.
2838   Thou lou'st me not: for, Brother, if thou did'st,
2839   Thy teares would wash this cold congealed blood,
2840   That glewes my Lippes, and will not let me speake.
2841   Come quickly {Mountague}, or I am dead.
2842   <S {Som}.> Ah {Warwicke}, {Mountague} hath breath'd his last,
2843   And to the latest gaspe, cry'd out for {Warwicke}:
2844   And said, Commend me to my valiant Brother.
2845   And more he would haue said, and more he spoke,
2846   Which sounded like a Cannon in a Vault,
2847   That mought not be distinguisht: but at last,
2848   I well might heare, deliuered with a groane,
2849   Oh farewell {Warwicke}.
2850   <S {Warw}.> Sweet rest his Soule:
2851   Flye Lords, and saue your selues,
2852   For {Warwicke} bids you all farewell, to meet in Heauen.
2853  *<S {Oxf}.> Away, away, to meet the Queenes great power.
2854   <D {Here they beare away his Body.  Exeunt}.>
2855   <D {Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with}
2856   {Richard, Clarence, and the rest}.>
2857  *<S {King}.> Thus farre our fortune keepes an vpward course,
2858   And we are grac'd with wreaths of Victorie:
2859   But in the midst of this bright- shining Day,
2860   I spy a black suspicious threatning Cloud,
2861   That will encounter with our glorious Sunne,
2862   Ere he attaine his easefull Westerne Bed:
2863   I meane, my Lords, those powers that the Queene
2864   Hath rays'd in Gallia, haue arriued our Coast,
2865   And, as we heare, march on to fight with vs.
2866   <S {Clar}.> A little gale will soone disperse that Cloud,
2867   And blow it to the Source from whence it came,
2868   Thy very Beames will dry those Vapours vp,
2869   For euery Cloud engenders not a Storme.
2870   <S {Rich}.> The Queene is valued thirtie thousand strong,
2871   And {Somerset}, with {Oxford}, fled to her:
2872   If she haue time to breathe, be well assur'd
2873   Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
2874   <S {King}.> We are aduertis'd by our louing friends,
2875   That they doe hold their course toward Tewksbury.
2876   We hauing now the best at Barnet field,
2877   Will thither straight, for willingnesse rids way,
2878   And as we march, our strength will be augmented:
2879   In euery Countie as we goe along,
2880   Strike vp the Drumme, cry courage, and away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2881   <D {Flourish. March. Enter the Queene, young}
2882   {Edward, Somerset, Oxford, and}
2883   {Souldiers}.>
2884  *<S {Qu}.> Great Lords, wise men ne'r sit and waile their losse,
2885   But chearely seeke how to redresse their harmes.
2886   What though the Mast be now blowne ouer- boord,
2887   The Cable broke, the holding- Anchor lost,
2888   And halfe our Saylors swallow'd in the flood?
2889   Yet liues our Pilot still. Is't meet, that hee
2890   Should leaue the Helme, and like a fearefull Lad,
2891   With tearefull Eyes adde Water to the Sea,
2892   And giue more strength to that which hath too much,
2893   Whiles in his moane, the Ship splits on the Rock,
2894   Which Industrie and Courage might haue sau'd?
2895   Ah what a shame, ah what a fault were this.
2896   Say {Warwicke} was our Anchor: what of that?
      <P q3v>
2897   And {Mountague} our Top- Mast: what of him?
2898   Our slaught'red friends, the Tackles: what of these?
2899   Why is not {Oxford} here, another Anchor?
2900   And {Somerset}, another goodly Mast?
2901   The friends of France our Shrowds and Tacklings?
2902   And though vnskilfull, why not {Ned} and I,
2903   For once allow'd the skilfull Pilots Charge?
2904   We will not from the Helme, to sit and weepe,
2905  *But keepe our Course (though the rough Winde say no)
2906   From Shelues and Rocks, that threaten vs with Wrack.
2907   As good to chide the Waues, as speake them faire.
2908   And what is {Edward}, but a ruthlesse Sea?
2909   What {Clarence}, but a Quick- sand of Deceit?
2910   And {Richard}, but a raged fatall Rocke?
2911   All these, the Enemies to our poore Barke.
2912   Say you can swim, alas 'tis but #a while:
2913   Tread on the Sand, why there you quickly sinke,
2914   Bestride the Rock, the Tyde will wash you off,
2915   Or else you famish, that's a three- fold Death.
2916   This speake I (Lords) to let you vnderstand,
2917   If case some one of you would flye from vs,
2918   That there's no hop'd- for Mercy with the Brothers,
2919  *More then with ruthlesse Waues, with Sands and Rocks.
2920   Why courage then, what cannot be auoided,
2921   'Twere childish weakenesse to lament, or feare.
2922   <S {Prince}.> Me thinkes a Woman of this valiant Spirit,
2923   Should, if a Coward heard her speake these words,
2924   Infuse his Breast with Magnanimitie,
2925   And make him, naked, foyle a man at Armes.
2926   I speake not this, as doubting any here:
2927   For did I but suspect a fearefull man,
2928   He should haue leaue to goe away betimes,
2929   Least in our need he might infect another,
2930   And make him of like spirit to himselfe.
2931   If any such be here, as God forbid,
2932   Let him depart, before we neede his helpe.
2933   <S {Oxf}.> Women and Children of so high a courage,
2934   And Warriors faint, why 'twere perpetuall shame.
2935   Oh braue young Prince: thy famous Grandfather
2936   Doth liue againe in thee; long may'st thou liue,
2937   To beare his Image, and renew his Glories.
2938   <S {Som}.> And he that will not fight for such a hope,
2939   Goe home to Bed, and like the Owle by day,
2940   If he arise, be mock'd and wondred at.
2941   <S {Qu}.> Thankes gentle {Somerset}, sweet {Oxford} thankes.
2942  *<S {Prince}.> And take his thankes, that yet hath nothing
2943   else.
2944   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2945   <S {Mess}.> Prepare you Lords, for {Edward} is at hand,
2946   Readie to fight: therefore be resolute.
2947   <S {Oxf}.> I thought no lesse: it is his Policie,
2948   To haste thus fast, to finde vs vnprouided.
2949   <S {Som}.> But hee's deceiu'd, we are in readinesse.
2950  *<S {Qu}.> This cheares my heart, to see your forwardnesse.
2951  *<S {Oxf}.> Here pitch our Battaile, hence we will not budge.
2952   <D {Flourish, and march. Enter Edward, Richard},
2953   {Clarence, and Souldiers}.>
2954  *<S {Edw}.> Braue followers, yonder stands the thornie Wood,
2955   Which by the Heauens assistance, and your strength,
2956   Must by the Roots be hew'ne vp yet ere Night.
2957   I need not adde more fuell to your fire,
2958   For well I wot, ye blaze, to burne them out:
2959   Giue signall to the fight, and to it Lords.
2960  *<S {Qu}.> Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, what I should say,
2961   My teares gaine- say: for euery word I speake,
2962   Ye see I drinke the water of my eye.
2963   Therefore no more but this: {Henry} your Soueraigne
2964   Is Prisoner to the Foe, his State vsurp'd,
2965   His Realme a slaughter- house, his Subiects slaine,
2966   His Statutes cancell'd, and his Treasure spent:
2967   And yonder is the Wolfe, that makes this spoyle.
2968   You fight in Iustice: then in Gods Name, Lords,
2969   Be valiant, and giue signall to the fight.
2970   <D {Alarum, Retreat, Excursions. Exeunt}.>
2971   <D {Flourish. Enter Edward, Richard, Queene, Clarence},
2972   {Oxford, Somerset}.>
2973   <S {Edw}.> Now here a period of tumultuous Broyles.
2974   Away with {Oxford}, to Hames Castle straight:
2975   For {Somerset}, off with his guiltie Head.
2976   Goe beare them hence, I will not heare them speake.
2977   <S {Oxf}.> For my part, Ile not trouble thee with words.
2978   <S {Som}.> Nor I, but stoupe with patience to my fortune.
2979   <D {Exeunt}.>
2980   <S {Qu}.> So part we sadly in this troublous World,
2981   To meet with Ioy in sweet Ierusalem.
2982  *<S {Edw}.> Is Proclamation made, That who finds {Edward},
2983   Shall haue a high Reward, and he his Life?
2984   <S {Rich}.> It is, and loe where youthfull {Edward} comes.
2985   <D {Enter the Prince}.>
2986  *<S {Edw}.> Bring forth the Gallant, let vs heare him speake.
2987   What? can so young a Thorne begin to prick?
2988   {#Edward}, what satisfaction canst thou make,
2989   For bearing Armes, for stirring vp my Subiects,
2990   And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
2991  *<S {Prince}.> Speake like a Subiect, prowd ambitious {Yorke}.
2992   Suppose that I am now my Fathers Mouth,
2993   Resigne thy Chayre, and where I stand, kneele thou,
2994   Whil'st I propose the selfe- same words to thee,
2995   Which (Traytor) thou would'st haue me answer to.
2996   <S {Qu}.> Ah, that thy Father had beene so resolu'd.
2997   <S {Rich}.> That you might still haue worne the Petticoat,
2998   And ne're haue stolne the Breech from {Lancaster}.
2999   <S {Prince}.> Let {Aesop} fable in a Winters Night,
3000   His Currish Riddles sorts not with this place.
3001   <S {Rich}.> By Heauen, Brat, Ile plague ye for that word.
3002   <S {Qu}.> #I, thou wast borne to be a plague to men.
3003   <S {Rich}.> For Gods sake, take away this Captiue Scold.
3004  *<S {Prince}.> Nay, take away this scolding Crooke- backe,
3005   rather.
3006  *<S {Edw}.> Peace wilfull Boy, or I will charme your tongue.
3007   <S {Clar}.> Vntutor'd Lad, thou art too malapert.
3008   <S {Prince}.> I know my dutie, you are all vndutifull:
3009   Lasciuious {Edward}, and thou periur'd {George},
3010   And thou mis- shapen {Dicke}, I tell ye all,
3011   I am your better, Traytors as ye are,
3012   And thou vsurp'st my Fathers right and mine.
3013   <S {Edw}.> Take that, the likenesse of this Rayler here.
3014   <D {Stabs him}.>
3015   <S {Rich}.> Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agonie.
3016   <D {Rich[ard]. stabs him}.>
3017   <S {Clar}.> And ther's for twitting me with periurie.
3018   <D {Clar[ence]. stabs him}.>
3019   <S {Qu}.> Oh, kill me too.
3020   <S {Rich}.> Marry, and shall. <D {Offers to kill her}.>
3021  *<S {Edw}.> Hold, {Richard}, hold, for we haue done too much.
      <P q4><C B>
3022  *<S {Rich}.> Why should shee liue, to fill the World with
3023   words.
3024  *<S {Edw}.> What? doth shee swowne? vse meanes for her
3025   recouerie.
3026   <S {Rich}.> {Clarence} excuse me to the King my Brother:
3027   Ile hence to London on a serious matter,
3028   Ere ye come there, be sure to heare some newes.
3029   <S {Cla}.> What? what?
3030   <S {Rich}.> Tower, the Tower. <D {Exit}.>
3031   <S {Qu}.> Oh {Ned}, sweet {Ned}, speake to thy Mother Boy.
3032   Can'st thou not speake? O Traitors, Murtherers!
3033   They that stabb'd {Caesar}, shed no blood at all:
3034   Did not offend, nor were not worthy Blame,
3035   If this foule deed were by, to equall it.
3036   He was a Man; this (in respect) a Childe,
3037   And Men, ne're spend their fury on a Childe.
3038   What's worse then Murtherer, that I may name it?
3039   No, no, my heart will burst, #and if I speake,
3040   And I will speake, that so my heart may burst.
3041   Butchers and Villaines, bloudy Caniballes,
3042   How sweet a Plant haue you vntimely cropt:
3043   You haue no children (Butchers) if you had,
3044   The thought of them would haue stirr'd vp remorse,
3045   But if you euer chance to haue a Childe,
3046   Looke in his youth to haue him so cut off.
3047   As deathsmen you haue rid this sweet yong Prince.
3048   <S {King}.> Away with her, go beare her hence perforce.
3049   <S {Qu}.> Nay, neuer beare me hence, dispatch me heere:
3050   Here sheath thy Sword, Ile pardon thee my death:
3051   What? wilt thou not? Then {Clarence} do it thou.
3052   <S {Cla}.> By heauen, I will not do thee so much ease.
3053  *<S {Qu}.> Good {Clarence} do: sweet {Clarence} do thou do it.
3054  *<S {Cla}.> Did'st thou not heare me sweare I would not do it?
3055   <S {Qu}.> #I, but thou vsest to forsweare thy selfe.
3056   'Twas Sin before, but now 'tis Charity
3057   What wilt y not? Where is that diuels butcher {Richard}?
3058   Hard fauor'd {Richard}? {Richard}, where art thou?
3059   Thou art not heere; Murther is thy Almes- deed:
3060   Petitioners for Blood, thou ne're put'st backe.
3061   <S {Ed}.> Away I say, I charge ye beare her hence,
3062   <S {Qu}.> So come to you, and yours, as to this Prince.
3063   <D {Exit Queene}.>
3064   <S {Ed}.> Where's {Richard} gone.
3065   <S {Cla}.> To London all in post, and as I guesse,
3066   To make a bloody Supper in the Tower.
3067   <S {Ed}.> He's sodaine if a thing comes in his head.
3068   Now march we hence, discharge the common sort
3069   With Pay and Thankes, and let's away to London,
3070   And see our gentle Queene how well she fares,
3071   By this (I hope) she hath a Sonne for me.  <D {Exit}.>
3072   <D {Enter Henry the sixt, and Richard, with the Lieutenant}
3073   {on the Walles}.>
3074   <S {Rich}.> Good day, my Lord, what at your Booke so
3075   hard?
3076   <S {Hen}.> #I my good Lord: my Lord I should say rather,
3077   Tis sinne to flatter, Good was little better:
3078   'Good Gloster, and good Deuill, were alike,
3079   And both preposterous: therefore, not Good Lord.
3080   <S {Rich}.> Sirra, leaue vs to our selues, we must conferre.
3081  *<S {Hen}.> So flies the wreaklesse shepherd from y Wolfe:
3082   So first the harmlesse Sheepe doth yeeld his Fleece,
3083   And next his Throate, vnto the Butchers Knife.
3084   What Scene of death hath {Rossius} now to Acte?
3085   <S {Rich}.> Suspition alwayes haunts the guilty minde,
3086   The Theefe doth feare each bush an Officer,
3087   <S {Hen}.> The Bird that hath bin limed in a bush,
3088   With trembling wings misdoubteth euery bush;
3089   And I the haplesse Male to one sweet Bird,
3090   Haue now the fatall Obiect in my eye,
3091  *Where my poore yong was lim'd, was caught, and kill'd.
3092  *<S {Rich}.> Why what a peeuish Foole was that of Creet,
3093   That taught his Sonne the office of a Fowle,
3094   And yet for all his wings, the Foole was drown'd.
3095   <S {Hen}.> I {Dedalus}, my poore Boy {Icarus},
3096   Thy Father {Minos}, that deni'de our course,
3097   The Sunne that sear'd the wings of my sweet Boy.
3098   Thy Brother {Edward}, and thy Selfe, the Sea
3099   Whose enuious Gulfe did swallow vp his life:
3100   Ah, kill me with thy Weapon, not with words,
3101   My brest can better brooke thy Daggers point,
3102   Then can my eares that Tragicke History.
3103   But wherefore dost thou come? Is't for my Life?
3104   <S {Rich}.> Think'st thou I am an Executioner?
3105   <S {Hen}.> A Persecutor I am sure thou art,
3106   If murthering Innocents be Executing,
3107   Why then thou art an Executioner.
3108   <S {Rich}.> Thy Son I kill'd for his presumption.
3109  *<S {Hen}.> Hadst thou bin kill'd, when first y didst presume,
3110   Thou had'st not liu'd to kill a Sonne of mine:
3111   And thus I prophesie, that many a thousand,
3112   Which now mistrust no parcell of my feare,
3113   And many an old mans sighe, and many a Widdowes,
3114   And many an Orphans water- standing- eye,
3115   Men for their Sonnes, Wiues for their Husbands,
3116   Orphans, for their Parents timeles death,
3117   Shall rue the houre that euer thou was't borne.
3118   The Owle shriek'd at thy birth, an euill signe,
3119   The Night- Crow cry'de, aboding lucklesse time,
3120  *Dogs howl'd, and hiddeous Tempest shook down Trees:
3121   The Rauen rook'd her on the Chimnies top,
3122   And chatt'ring Pies in dismall Discords sung:
3123   Thy Mother felt more then a Mothers paine,
3124   And yet brought forth lesse then a Mothers hope,
3125   To wit, an indigested and deformed lumpe,
3126   Not like the fruit of such a goodly Tree.
3127   Teeth had'st thou in thy head, when thou was't borne,
3128   To signifie, thou cam'st to bite the world:
3129   And if the rest be true, which I haue heard,
3130   Thou cam'st===
3131   <S {Rich}.> Ile heare no more:
3132   Dye Prophet in thy speech,  <D {Stabbes him}.>
3133   For this (among'st the rest) was I ordain'd.
3134   <S {Hen}.> #I, and for much more slaughter after this,
3135   O God forgiue my sinnes, and pardon thee.  <D {Dyes}.>
3136   <S {Rich}.> What? will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
3137   Sinke in the ground? I thought it would haue mounted.
3138   See how my sword weepes for the poore Kings death.
3139   O may such purple teares be alway shed
3140   From those that wish the downfall of our house.
3141   If any sparke of Life be yet remaining,
3142   Downe, downe to #hell, and say I sent thee thither.
3143   <D {Stabs him againe}.>
3144   I that haue neyther pitty, loue, nor feare,
3145   Indeed 'tis true that {Henrie} told me of:
3146   For I haue often heard my Mother say,
3147   I came into the world with my Legges forward.
3148   Had I not reason (thinke ye) to make #hast,
3149   And seeke their Ruine, that vsurp'd our Right?
3150   The Midwife wonder'd, and the Women cri'de
3151   O Iesus blesse vs, he is borne with teeth,
      <P q4v>
3152   And so I was, which plainly signified,
3153   That I should snarle, and bite, and play the dogge:
3154   Then since the Heauens haue shap'd my Body so,
3155   Let #Hell make crook'd my Minde to answer it.
3156   I haue no Brother, I am like no Brother:
3157   And this word (Loue) which Gray- beards call Diuine,
3158   Be resident in men like one another,
3159   And not in me: I am my selfe alone.
3160   {#Clarence} beware, thou keept'st me from the Light,
3161   But I will sort a pitchy day for thee:
3162   For I will buzze abroad such Prophesies,
3163   That {Edward} shall be fearefull of his life,
3164   And then to purge his feare, Ile be thy death.
3165   King {Henry}, and the Prince his Son are gone,
3166   {#Clarence} thy turne is next, and then the rest,
3167   Counting my selfe but bad, till I be best.
3168   Ile throw thy body in another roome,
3169   And Triumph {Henry}, in thy day of Doome.  <D {Exit}.>
3170  *<D {Flourish. Enter King, Queene, Clarence, Richard, Hastings},
3171   {Nurse, and Attendants}.>
3172   <S {King}.> Once more we sit in Englands Royall Throne,
3173   Re- purchac'd with the Blood of Enemies:
3174   What valiant Foe- men, like to Autumnes Corne,
3175   Haue we mow'd downe in tops of all their pride?
3176   Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold Renowne,
3177   For hardy and vndoubted Champions:
3178   Two {Cliffords}, as the Father and the Sonne,
3179   And two Northumberlands: two brauer men,
3180   Ne're spurr'd their Coursers at the Trumpets sound.
3181  *With them, the two braue Beares, {Warwick} & {Montague},
3182   That in their Chaines fetter'd the Kingly Lyon,
3183   And made the Forrest tremble when they roar'd.
3184   Thus haue we swept Suspition from our Seate,
3185   And made our Footstoole of Security.
3186   Come hither {Besse}, and let me kisse my Boy:
3187   Yong {Ned}, for thee, thine Vnckles, and my selfe,
3188   Haue in our Armors watcht the Winters night,
3189   Went all afoote in Summers scalding heate,
3190   That thou might'st repossesse the Crowne in peace,
3191   And of our Labours thou shalt reape the gaine.
3192   <S {Rich}.> Ile blast his Haruest, if your head were laid,
3193   For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
3194   This shoulder was ordain'd so thicke, to heaue,
3195   And heaue it shall some waight, or breake my backe,
3196   Worke thou the way, and that shalt execute.
3197   <S {King}.> {Clarence} and {Gloster}, loue my louely Queene,
3198   And kis your Princely Nephew Brothers both.
3199   <S {Cla}.> The duty that I owe vnto your Maiesty,
3200   I Seale vpon the lips of this sweet Babe.
3201  *<S {Cla}.> Thanke Noble {Clarence}, worthy brother thanks.
3202  *<S {Rich}.> And that I loue the tree fro[m] whence y sprang'st:
3203   Witnesse the louing kisse I giue the Fruite,
3204   To say the truth, so {Iudas} kist his master,
3205   And cried all haile, when as he meant all harme.
3206   <S {King}.> Now am I seated as my soule delights,
3207   Hauing my Countries peace, and Brothers loues.
3208  *<S {Cla}.> What will your Grace haue done with {Margaret},
3209   {Reynard} her Father, to the King of France
3210   Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Ierusalem,
3211   And hither haue they sent it for her ransome.
3212  *<S {King}.> Away with her, and waft her hence to France:
3213   And now what rests, but that we spend the time
3214   With stately Triumphes, mirthfull Comicke shewes,
3215   Such as befits the pleasure of the Court.
3216   Sound Drums and Trumpets, farwell sowre annoy,
3217   For heere I hope begins our lasting ioy.  <D {Exeunt omnes}>
