3      <S {Kent}.>
4     *I thought the King had more affected the
5      Duke of {Albany}, then {Cornwall}.
6     *<S {Glou}.> It did alwayes seeme so to vs: But
7     *now in the diuision of the Kingdome, it ap-peares
8     *not which of the Dukes hee valewes
9     *most, for qualities are so weigh'd, that curiosity in nei-ther,
10     can make choise of eithers moity.
11     <S {Kent}.> Is not this your Son, my Lord?
12    *<S {Glou}.> His breeding Sir, hath bin at my charge. I haue
13    *so often blush'd to acknowledge him, that now I am
14     braz'd too't.
15     <S {Kent}.> I cannot conceiue you.
16    *<S {Glou}.> Sir, this yong Fellowes mother could; where-vpon
17    *she grew round womb'd, and had indeede (Sir) a
18    *Sonne for her Cradle, ere she had a husband for her bed.
19     Do you smell a fault?
20    *<S {Kent}.> I cannot wish the fault vndone, the issue of it,
21     being so proper.
22    *<S {Glou}.> But I haue a Sonne, Sir, by order of Law, some
23    *yeere elder then this; who, yet is no deerer in my ac-count,
24    *though this Knaue came somthing sawcily to the
25    *world before he was sent for: yet was his Mother fayre,
26    *there was good sport at his making, and the horson must
27    *be acknowledged. Doe you know this Noble Gentle-man,
28     {Edmond}?
29     <S {Edm}.> No, my Lord.
30     <S {Glou}.> My Lord of Kent:
31     Remember him heereafter, as my Honourable Friend.
32     <S {Edm}.> My seruices to your Lordship.
33     <S {Kent}.> I must loue you, and sue to know you better.
34     <S {Edm}.> Sir, I shall study deseruing.
35    *<S {Glou}.> He hath bin out nine yeares, and away he shall
36     againe. The King is comming.
37    *<D {Sennet. Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Gonerill, Re-gan},
38     {Cordelia, and attendants}.>
39    *<S {Lear}.> Attend the Lords of France & Burgundy, Gloster.
40     <S {Glou}.> I shall, my Lord.  <D {Exit}.>
41    *<S {Lear}.> Meane time we shal expresse our darker purpose.
42     Giue me the Map there. Know, that we haue diuided
43     In three our Kingdome: and 'tis our fast intent,
44     To shake all Cares and Businesse from our Age,
45     Conferring them on yonger strengths, while we
46    *Vnburthen'd crawle toward death. Our son of {Cornwal},
47     And you our no lesse louing Sonne of {Albany},
48     We haue this houre a constant #will to publish
49     Our daughters seuerall Dowers, that future strife
50    *May be preuented now. The Princes, {France} & {Burgundy},
51     Great Riuals in our yongest daughters loue,
52     Long in our Court, haue made their amorous soiourne,
53     And heere are to be answer'd. Tell me my daughters
54     (Since now we will diuest vs both of Rule,
55     Interest of Territory, Cares of State)
56     Which of you shall we say doth loue vs most,
57     That we, our largest bountie may extend
58     Where Nature doth with merit challenge. {Gonerill},
59     Our eldest borne, speake first.
60    *<S {Gon}.> Sir, I loue you more then word can weild y matter,
61     Deerer then eye- sight, space, and libertie,
62     Beyond what can be valewed, rich or rare,
63     No lesse then life, with grace, health, beauty, honor:
64     As much as Childe ere lou'd, or Father found.
65     A loue that makes breath poore, and speech vnable,
66     Beyond all manner of so much I loue you.
67    *<S {Cor}.> What shall {Cordelia} speake? Loue, and be silent.
68    *<S {Lear}.> Of all these bounds euen from this Line, to this,
69     With shadowie Forrests, and with Champains rich'd
70     With plenteous Riuers, and wide- skirted Meades
71     We make thee Lady. To thine and {Albanies} issues
72     Be this perpetuall. What sayes our second Daughter?
73     Our deerest {Regan}, wife of {Cornwall}?
74     <S {Reg}.> I am made of that selfe- mettle as my Sister,
75     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,
76     I finde she names my very deede of loue:
77     Onely she comes too short, that I professe
78     My selfe an enemy to all other ioyes,
79     Which the most precious square of sense professes,
80     And finde I am alone felicitate
81     In your deere Highnesse loue.
82     <S {Cor}.> Then poore {Cordelia},
83     And yet not so, since I am sure my loue's
84     More ponderous then my tongue.
85     <S {Lear}.> To thee, and thine hereditarie euer,
86     Remaine this ample third of our faire Kingdome,
87     No lesse in space, validitie, and pleasure
88     Then that conferr'd on {Gonerill}. Now our Ioy,
89     Although our last and least; to whose yong loue,
90     The Vines of France, and Milke of Burgundie,
91     Striue to be interest. What can you say, to draw
92     A third, more opilent then your Sisters? speake.
93     <S {Cor}.> Nothing my Lord.
94     <S {Lear}.> Nothing?
      <P qq2v><C E>
95     <S {Cor}.> Nothing.
96     <S {Lear}.> Nothing will come of nothing, speake againe.
97     <S {Cor}.> Vnhappie that I am, I cannot heaue
98     My heart into my mouth: I loue your Maiesty
99     According to my bond, no more nor lesse.
100   *<S {Lear}.> How, how {Cordelia}? Mend your speech a little,
101    Least you may marre your Fortunes.
102    <S {Cor}.> Good my Lord,
103    You haue begot me, bred me, lou'd me.
104    I returne those duties backe as are right fit,
105    Obey you, Loue you, and most Honour you.
106    Why haue my Sisters Husbands, if they say
107    They loue you all? Happily when I shall wed,
108    That Lord, whose hand must take my plight, shall carry
109    Halfe my loue with him, halfe my Care, and Dutie,
110    Sure I shall neuer marry like my Sisters.
111    <S {Lear}.> But goes thy heart with this?
112    <S {Cor}.> #I my good Lord.
113    <S {Lear}.> So young, and so vntender?
114    <S {Cor}.> So young my Lord, and true.
115    <S {Lear}.> Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dowre:
116    For by the sacred radience of the Sunne,
117    The misteries of {Heccat} and the night:
118    By all the operation of the Orbes,
119    From whom we do exist, and cease to be,
120    Heere I disclaime all my Paternall care,
121    Propinquity and property of blood,
122    And as a stranger to my heart and me,
123    Hold thee from this for euer. The barbarous {Scythian},
124    Or he that makes his generation messes
125    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosome
126    Be as well neighbour'd, pittied, and releeu'd,
127    As thou my sometime Daughter.
128    <S {Kent}.> Good my Liege.
129    <S {Lear}.> Peace {Kent},
130    Come not betweene the Dragon and his wrath,
131    I lou'd her most, and thought to set my rest
132    On her kind nursery. Hence and avoid my sight:
133    So be my graue my peace, as here I giue
134    Her Fathers heart from her; call {France}, who stirres?
135    Call {Burgundy}, {Cornwall}, and {Albanie},
136    With my two Daughters Dowres, digest the third,
137    Let pride, which she cals plainnesse, marry her:
138    I doe inuest you ioyntly with my power,
139    Preheminence, and all the large effects
140   *That troope with Maiesty. Our selfe by Monthly course,
141    With reseruation of an hundred Knights,
142    By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
143    Make with you by due turne, onely we shall retaine
144    The name, and all th' addition to a King: the Sway,
145    Reuennew, Execution of the rest,
146    Beloued Sonnes be yours, which to confirme,
147    This Coronet part betweene you.
148    <S {Kent}.> Royall {Lear},
149    Whom I haue euer honor'd as my King,
150    Lou'd as my Father, as my Master follow'd,
151    As my great Patron thought on in my praiers.
152   *<S {Le}.> The bow is bent & drawne, make from the shaft.
153    <S {Kent}.> Let it fall rather, though the forke inuade
154    The region of my heart, be {Kent} vnmannerly,
155    When {Lear} is mad, what wouldest thou do old man?
156    Think'st thou that dutie shall haue dread to speake,
157    When power to flattery bowes?
158    To plainnesse honour's bound,
159    When Maiesty falls to folly, reserue thy state,
160    And in thy best consideration checke
161    This hideous rashnesse, answere my life, my iudgement:
162    Thy yongest Daughter do's not loue thee least,
163    Nor are those empty hearted, whose low sounds
164    Reuerbe no hollownesse.
165    <S {Lear}.> {Kent}, on thy life no more.
166    <S {Kent}.> My life I neuer held but as pawne
167    To wage against thine enemies, nere feare to loose it,
168    Thy safety being motiue.
169    <S {Lear}.> Out of my sight.
170    <S {Kent}.> See better {Lear}, and let me still remaine
171    The true blanke of thine eie.
172    <S {Lear}.> Now by {Apollo},
173    <S {Kent}.> Now by {Apollo}, King
174    Thou swear'st thy Gods in vaine.
175    <S {Lear}.> O Vassall! Miscreant.
176    <S {Alb}. {Cor}.> Deare Sir forbeare.
177    <S {Kent}.> Kill thy Physition, and thy fee bestow
178    Vpon the foule disease, reuoke thy guift,
179    Or whil'st I can vent clamour from my throate,
180    Ile tell thee thou dost euill.
181   *<S {Lea}.> Heare me recreant, on thine allegeance heare me;
182    That thou hast sought to make vs breake our vowes,
183    Which we durst neuer yet; and with strain'd pride,
184    To come betwixt our sentences, and our power,
185    Which, nor our nature, nor our place can beare;
186    Our potencie made good, take thy reward.
187    Fiue dayes we do allot thee for prouision,
188    To shield thee from disasters of the world,
189    And on the sixt to turne thy hated backe
190    Vpon our kingdome: if on the tenth day following,
191    Thy banisht trunke be found in our Dominions,
192    The moment is thy death, away. By {Iupiter},
193    This shall not be reuok'd,
194   *<S {Kent}.> Fare thee well King, sith thus thou wilt appeare,
195    Freedome liues hence, and banishment is here;
196    The Gods to their deere shelter take thee Maid,
197    That iustly think'st, and hast most rightly said:
198    And your large speeches, may your deeds approue,
199    That good effects may spring from words of loue:
200    Thus {Kent}, O Princes, bids you all adew,
201    Hee'l shape his old course, in a Country new.  <D {Exit}.>
202    <D {Flourish. Enter Gloster with France, and Bur-gundy},
203    {Attendants}.>
204    <S {Cor}.> Heere's {France} and {Burgundy}, my Noble Lord.
205    <S {Lear}.> My Lord of {Burgundie},
206    We first addresse toward you, who with this King
207    Hath riuald for our Daughter; what in the least
208    Will you require in present Dower with her,
209    Or cease your quest of Loue?
210    <S {Bur}.> Most Royall Maiesty,
211    I craue no more then hath your Highnesse offer'd,
212    Nor will you tender lesse?
213    <S {Lear}.> Right Noble {Burgundy},
214    When she was deare to vs, we did hold her so,
215    But now her price is fallen: Sir, there she stands,
216    If ought within that little seeming substance,
217    Or all of it with our displeasure piec'd,
218    And nothing more may fitly like your Grace,
219    Shee's there, and she is yours.
220    <S {Bur}.> I know no answer.
221    <S {Lear}.> Will you with those infirmities she owes,
222    Vnfriended, new adopted to our hate,
223    Dow'rd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
224    Take her or, leaue her.
      <P qq3>
225    <S {Bur}.> Pardon me Royall Sir,
226    Election makes not vp in such conditions.
227   *<S {Le}.> Then leaue her sir, for by the powre that made me,
228    I tell you all her wealth. For you great King,
229    I would not from your loue make such a stray,
230    To match you where I hate, therefore beseech you
231    T' auert your liking a more worthier way,
232    Then on a wretch whom Nature is asham'd
233    Almost t' acknowledge hers.
234    <S {Fra}.> This is most strange,
235    That she whom euen but now, was your obiect,
236    The argument of your praise, balme of your age,
237    The best, the deerest, should in this trice of time
238    Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
239    So many folds of fauour: sure her offence
240    Must be of such vnnaturall degree,
241    That monsters it: Or your fore- voucht affection
242    Fall into taint, which to beleeue of her
243    Must be a faith that reason without miracle
244    Should neuer plant in me.
245    <S {Cor}.> I yet beseech your Maiesty.
246    If for I want that glib and oylie #Art,
247    To speake and purpose not, since what I will intend,
248    Ile do't before I speake, that you make knowne
249    It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulenesse,
250    No vnchaste action or dishonoured step
251    That hath depriu'd me of your Grace and fauour,
252    But euen for want of that, for which I am richer,
253    A still soliciting eye, and such a tongue,
254    That I am glad I haue not, though not to haue it,
255    Hath lost me in your liking.
256    <S {Lear}.> Better thou had'st
257    Not beene borne, then not t'haue pleas'd me better.
258    <S {Fra}.> Is it but this? A tardinesse in nature,
259    Which often leaues the history vnspoke
260    That it intends to do: my Lord of {Burgundy},
261    What say you to the Lady? Loue's not loue
262    When it is mingled with regards, that stands
263    Aloofe from th' intire point, will you haue her?
264    She is herselfe a Dowrie.
265    <S {Bur}.> Royall King,
266    Giue but that portion which your selfe propos'd,
267    And here I take {Cordelia} by the hand,
268    Dutchesse of {Burgundie}.
269    <S {Lear}.> Nothing, I haue sworne, I am firme.
270    <S {Bur}.> I am sorry then you haue so lost a Father,
271    That you must loose a husband.
272    <S {Cor}.> Peace be with {Burgundie},
273    Since that respect and Fortunes are his loue,
274    I shall not be his wife.
275    <S {Fra}.> Fairest {Cordelia}, that art most rich being poore,
276    Most choise forsaken, and most lou'd despis'd,
277    Thee and thy vertues here I seize vpon,
278    Be it lawfull I take vp what's cast away.
279   *Gods, Gods! 'Tis strange, that from their cold'st neglect
280    My Loue should kindle to enflam'd respect.
281   *Thy dowrelesse Daughter King, throwne to my chance,
282    Is Queene of vs, of ours, and our faire {France}:
283    Not all the Dukes of watrish {Burgundy},
284    Can buy this vnpriz'd precious Maid of me.
285    Bid them farewell {Cordelia}, though vnkinde,
286    Thou loosest here a better where to finde.
287    <S {Lear}.> Thou hast her {France}, let her be thine, for we
288    Haue no such Daughter, nor shall euer see
289    That face of hers againe, therfore be gone,
290    Without our Grace, our Loue, our Benizon:
291    Come Noble {Burgundie}.  <D {Flourish.  Exeunt}.>
292    <S {Fra}.> Bid farwell to your Sisters.
293    <S {Cor}.> The Iewels of our Father, with wash'd eies
294    {Cordelia} leaues you, I know you what you are,
295    And like a Sister am most loth to call
296    Your faults as they are named. Loue well our Father:
297    To your professed bosomes I commit him,
298    But yet alas, stood I within his Grace,
299    I would prefer him to a better place,
300    So farewell to you both.
301    <S {Regn}.> Prescribe not vs our dutie.
302    <S {Gon}.> Let your study
303    Be to content your Lord, who hath receiu'd you
304    At Fortunes almes, you haue obedience scanted,
305    And well are worth the want that you haue wanted.
306   *<S {Cor}.> Time shall vnfold what plighted cunning hides,
307    Who couers faults, at last with shame derides:
308    Well may you prosper.
309    <S {Fra}.> Come my faire {Cordelia}.  <D {Exit France and Cor}.>
310    <S {Gon}.> Sister, it is not little I haue to say,
311    Of what most neerely appertaines to vs both,
312    I thinke our Father will hence to night.
313   *<S {Reg}.> That's most certaine, and with you: next moneth |(with vs.
314   *<S {Gon}.> You see how full of changes his age is, the ob-seruation
315   *we haue made of it hath beene little; he alwaies
316   *lou'd our Sister most, and with what poore iudgement he
317    hath now cast her off, appeares too grossely.
318   *<S {Reg}.> 'Tis the infirmity of his age, yet he hath euer but
319    slenderly knowne himselfe.
320   *<S {Gon}.> The best and soundest of his time hath bin but
321   *rash, then must we looke from his age, to receiue not a-lone
322   *the imperfections of long ingraffed condition, but
323   *therewithall the vnruly way- wardnesse, that infirme and
324    cholericke yeares bring with them.
325   *<S {Reg}.> Such vnconstant starts are we like to haue from
326    him, as this of {Kents} banishment.
327   *<S {Gon}.> There is further complement of leaue- taking be-tweene
328   *{France} and him, pray you let vs sit together, if our
329   *Father carry authority with such disposition as he beares,
330    this last surrender of his will but offend vs.
331    <S {Reg}.> We shall further thinke of it.
332   *<S {Gon}.> We must do something, and i'th' heate.  <D {Exeunt}.>
333    <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
334    <D {Enter Bastard}.>
335    <S {Bast}.> Thou Nature art my Goddesse, to thy Law
336    My seruices are bound, wherefore should I
337    Stand in the plague of custome, and permit
338    The curiosity of Nations, to depriue me?
339    For that I am some twelue, or fourteene Moonshines
340    Lag of a Brother? Why Bastard? Wherefore base?
341    When my Dimensions are as well compact,
342    My minde as generous, and my shape as true
343    As honest Madams issue? Why brand they vs
344    With Base? With basenes Bastardie? Base, Base?
345    Who in the lustie stealth of Nature, take
346    More composition, and fierce qualitie,
347    Then doth within a dull stale tyred bed
348    Goe to th' creating a whole tribe of Fops
349    Got 'tweene #a sleepe, and wake? Well then,
350    Legitimate {Edgar}, I must haue your land,
351    Our Fathers loue, is to the Bastard {Edmond},
352    As to th' legitimate: fine word: Legitimate.
      <P qq3v><C B>
353    Well, my Legittimate, if this Letter speed,
354    And my inuention thriue, {Edmond} the base
355    Shall to'th' Legitimate: I grow, I prosper:
356    Now Gods, stand vp for Bastards.
357    <D {Enter Gloucester}.>
358   *<S {Glo}.> Kent banish'd thus? and France in choller parted?
359    And the King gone to night? Prescrib'd his powre,
360    Confin'd to exhibition? All this done
361    Vpon the gad? {Edmond}, how now? What newes?
362    <S {Bast}.> So please your Lordship, none.
363   *<S {Glou}.> Why so earnestly seeke you to put vp y Letter?
364    <S {Bast}.> I know no newes, my Lord.
365    <S {Glou}.> What Paper were you reading?
366    <S {Bast}.> Nothing my Lord.
367   *<S {Glou}.> No? what needed then that terrible dispatch of
368   *it into your Pocket? The quality of nothing, hath not
369   *such neede to hide it selfe. Let's see: come, if it bee no-thing,
370    I shall not neede Spectacles.
371   *<S {Bast}.> I beseech you Sir, pardon mee; it is a Letter
372   *from my Brother, that I haue not all ore- read; and for so
373   *much as I haue perus'd, I finde it not fit for your ore- loo-king.

375    <S {Glou}.> Giue me the Letter, Sir.
376    <S {Bast}.> I shall offend, either to detaine, or giue it:
377    The Contents, as in part I vnderstand them,
378    Are #too blame.
379    <S {Glou}.> Let's see, let's see.
380   *<S {Bast}.> I hope for my Brothers iustification, hee wrote
381    this but as an essay, or taste of my Vertue.
382   *<S {Glou}. {reads}.> {This policie, and reuerence of Age, makes the}
383   *{world bitter to the best of our times: keepes our Fortunes from}
384   *{vs, till our oldnesse cannot rellish them. I begin to finde an idle}
385   *{and fond bondage, in the oppression of aged tyranny, who swayes}
386   *{not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me, that of}
387   *{this I may speake more. If our Father would sleepe till I wak'd}
388   *{him, you should enioy halfe his Reuennew for euer, and liue the}
389    {beloued of your Brother}.  Edgar.
390   *Hum? Conspiracy? Sleepe till I wake him, you should
391   *enioy halfe his Reuennew: my Sonne {Edgar}, had hee a
392   *hand to write this? A heart and braine to breede it in?
393    When came you to this? Who brought it?
394   *<S {Bast}.> It was not brought mee, my Lord; there's the
395   *cunning of it. I found it throwne in at the Casement of
396    my Closset.
397    <S {Glou}.> You know the character to be your Brothers?
398   *<S {Bast}.> If the matter were good my Lord, I durst swear
399   *it were his: but in respect of that, I would faine thinke it
400    were not.
401    <S {Glou}.> It is his.
402   *<S {Bast}.> It is his hand, my Lord: but I hope his heart is
403    not in the Contents.
404   *<S {Glo}.> Has he neuer before sounded you in this busines?
405   *<S {Bast}.> Neuer my Lord. But I haue heard him oft main-taine
406   *it to be fit, that Sonnes at perfect age, and Fathers
407   *declin'd, the Father should bee as Ward to the Son, and
408    the Sonne manage his Reuennew.
409   *<S {Glou}.> O Villain, villain: his very opinion in the Let-ter.
410   *Abhorred Villaine, vnnaturall, detested, brutish
411   *Villaine; worse then brutish: Go sirrah, seeke him: Ile
412    apprehend him. Abhominable Villaine, where is he?
413   *<S {Bast}.> I do not well know my L[ord]. If it shall please you to
414   *suspend your indignation against my Brother, til you can
415   *deriue from him better testimony of his intent, you shold
416   *run a certaine course: where, if you violently proceed a-gainst
417   *him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
418   *gap in your owne Honor, and shake in peeces, the heart of
419   *his obedience. I dare pawne downe my life for him, that
420   *he hath writ this to feele my affection to your Honor, &
421    to no other pretence of danger.
422    <S {Glou}.> Thinke you so?
423   *<S {Bast}.> If your Honor iudge it meete, I will place you
424   *where you shall heare vs conferre of this, and by an Auri-cular
425   *assurance haue your satisfaction, and that without
426    any further delay, then this very Euening.
427   *<S {Glou}.> He cannot bee such a Monster. {Edmond} seeke
428   *him out: winde me into him, I pray you: frame the Bu-sinesse
429   *after your owne wisedome. I would vnstate my
430    selfe, to be in a due resolution.
431   *<S {Bast}.> I will seeke him Sir, presently: conuey the bu-sinesse
432    as I shall find meanes, and acquaint you withall.
433   *<S {Glou}.> These late Eclipses in the Sun and Moone por-tend
434   *no good to vs: though the wisedome of Nature can
435   *reason it thus, and thus, yet Nature finds it selfe scourg'd
436   *by the sequent effects. Loue cooles, friendship falls off,
437   *Brothers diuide. In Cities, mutinies; in Countries, dis-cord;
438   *in Pallaces, Treason; and the Bond crack'd, 'twixt
439   *Sonne and Father. This villaine of mine comes vnder the
440   *prediction; there's Son against Father, the King fals from
441   *byas of Nature, there's Father against Childe. We haue
442   *seene the best of our time. Machinations, hollownesse,
443   *treacherie, and all ruinous disorders follow vs disquietly
444   *to our Graues. Find out this Villain, {Edmond}, it shall lose
445   *thee nothing, do it carefully: and the Noble & true- har-ted
446   *Kent banish'd; his offence, honesty. 'Tis strange.  <D {Exit}>
447   *<S {Bast}.> This is the excellent foppery of the world, that
448   *when we are sicke in fortune, often the surfets of our own
449   *behauiour, we make guilty of our disasters, the Sun, the
450   *Moone, and Starres, as if we were villaines on necessitie,
451   *Fooles by heauenly compulsion, Knaues, Theeues, and
452   *Treachers by Sphericall predominance. Drunkards, Ly-ars,
453   *and Adulterers by an inforc'd obedience of Planatary
454   *influence; and all that we are euill in, by a diuine thru-sting
455   *on. An admirable euasion of Whore- master- man,
456   *to lay his Goatish disposition on the charge of a Starre,
457   *My father compounded with my mother vnder the Dra-gons
458   *taile, and my Natiuity was vnder {Vrsa Maior}, so
459   *that it followes, I am rough and Leacherous. I should
460   *haue bin that I am, had the maidenlest Starre in the Fir-mament
461    twinkled on my bastardizing.
462    <D {Enter Edgar}.>
463   *Pat: he comes like the Catastrophe of the old Comedie:
464   *my Cue is villanous Melancholly, with a sighe like {Tom}
465   *#o' Bedlam. === O these Eclipses do portend these diui-sions.
466    Fa, Sol, #La, #Me.
467   *<S {Edg}.> How now Brother {Edmond}, what serious con-templation
468    are you in?
469   *<S {Bast}.> I am thinking Brother of a prediction I read this
470    other day, what should follow these Eclipses.
471    <S {Edg}.> Do you busie your selfe with that?
472   *<S {Bast}.> I promise you, the effects he writes of, succeede
473    vnhappily.
474    When saw you my Father last?
475    <S {Edg}.> The night gone by.
476    <S {Bast}.> Spake you with him?
477    <S {Edg}.> #I, two houres together.
478   *<S {Bast}.> Parted you in good termes? Found you no dis-pleasure
479    in him, by word, nor countenance?
480    <S {Edg}.> None at all,
481   *<S {Bast}.> Bethink your selfe wherein you may haue offen-ded
482   *him: and at my entreaty forbeare his presence, vntill
483   *some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure,
484   *which at this instant so rageth in him, that with the mis-chiefe
      <P qq4><C E>
485    of your person, it would scarsely alay.
486    <S {Edg}.> Some Villaine hath done me wrong.
487   *<S {Edm}.> That's my feare, I pray you haue a continent
488   *forbearance  till the speed of his rage goes slower: and as
489   *I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will
490   *fitly bring you to heare my Lord speake: pray ye goe,
491    there's my key: if you do stirre abroad, goe arm'd.
492    <S {Edg}.> Arm'd, Brother?
493   *<S {Edm}.> Brother, I aduise you to the best, I am no honest
494   *man, if ther be any good meaning toward you: I haue told
495   *you what I haue seene, and heard: But faintly. Nothing
496    like the image, and horror of it, pray you away.
497    <S {Edg}.> Shall I heare from you anon?  <D {Exit}.>
498    <S {Edm}.> I do serue you in this businesse:
499    A Credulous Father, and a Brother Noble,
500    Whose nature is so farre from doing harmes,
501    That he suspects none: on whose foolish honestie
502    My practises ride easie: I see the businesse.
503    Let me, if not by birth, haue lands by wit,
504    All with me's meete, that I can fashion fit. <D {Exit}.>
505    <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
506    <D {Enter Gonerill, and Steward}.>
507   *<S {Gon}.> Did my Father strike my Gentleman for chi-ding
508    of his Foole?
509    <S {Ste}.> #I Madam.
510    <S {Gon}.> By day and night, he wrongs me, euery howre
511    He flashes into one grosse crime, or other,
512    That sets vs all at ods: Ile not endure it;
513    His Knights grow riotous, and himselfe vpbraides vs
514    On euery trifle. When he returnes from hunting,
515    I will not speake with him, say I am sicke,
516    If you come slacke of former seruices,
517    You shall do well, the fault of it Ile answer.
518    <S {Ste}.> He's comming Madam, I heare him.
519    <S {Gon}.> Put on what weary negligence you please,
520    You and your Fellowes: I'de haue it come to question;
521    If he distaste it, let him to my Sister,
522    Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
523    Remember what I haue said.
524    <S {Ste}.> Well Madam.
525   *<S {Gon}.> And let his Knights haue colder lookes among
526   *you: what growes of it no matter, aduise your fellowes
527   *so, Ile write straight to my Sister to hold my course; pre-pare
528    for dinner.  <D {Exeunt}.>
529    <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
530    <D {Enter Kent}.>
531    <S {Kent}.> If but as will I other accents borrow,
532    That can my speech defuse, my good intent
533    May carry through it selfe to that full issue
534    For which I raiz'd my likenesse. Now banisht {Kent},
535    If thou canst serue where thou dost stand condemn'd,
536    So may it come, thy Master whom thou lou'st,
537    Shall find thee full of labours.
538    <D {Hornes within. Enter Lear and Attendants}.>
539   *<S {Lear}.> Let me not stay a iot for dinner, go get it rea-dy:
540    how now, what art thou?
541    <S {Kent}.> A man Sir.
542   *<S {Lear}.> What dost thou professe? What would'st thou
543    with vs?
544   *<S {Kent}.> I do professe to be no  lesse then I seeme; to serue
545   *him truely that will put me in trust, to loue him that is
546   *honest, to conuerse with him that is wise and saies little, to
547   *feare iudgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to
548    eate no fish.
549    <S {Lear}.> What art thou?
550   *<S {Kent}.> A very honest hearted Fellow, and as poore as
551    the King.
552   *<S {Lear}.> If thou be'st as poore for a subiect, as hee's for a
553    King, thou art poore enough. What wouldst thou?
554    <S {Kent}.> Seruice.
555    <S {Lear}.> Who wouldst thou serue?
556    <S {Kent}.> You.
557    <S {Lear}.> Do'st thou know me fellow?
558   *<S {Kent}.> No Sir, but you haue that in your countenance,
559    which I would faine call Master.
560    <S {Lear}.> What's that?
561    <S {Kent}.> Authority.
562    <S {Lear}.> What seruices canst thou do?
563   *<S {Kent}.> I can keepe honest counsaile, ride, run, marre a
564   *curious tale in telling it, and deliuer a plaine message
565   *bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am qual-lified
566    in, and the best of me, is Dilligence.
567    <S {Lear}.> How old art thou?
568   *<S {Kent}.> Not so young Sir to loue a woman for singing,
569   *nor so old to dote on her for any thing. I haue yeares on
570    my backe forty eight.
571   *<S {Lear}.> Follow me, thou shalt serue me, if I like thee no
572   *worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner
573   *ho, dinner, where's my knaue? my Foole? Go you and call
574   *my Foole hither. You you Sirrah, where's my Daughter?
575    <D {Enter Steward}.>
576    <S {Ste}.> So please you===  <D {Exit}.>
577   *<S {Lear}.> What saies the Fellow there? Call the Clot-pole
578   *backe: wher's my Foole? Ho, I thinke the world's
579    asleepe, how now? Where's that Mungrell?
580   *<S {Knigh}.> He saies my Lord, your Daughters is not well.
581   *<S {Lear}.> Why came not the slaue backe to me when I
582    call'd him?
583   *<S {Knigh}.> Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he
584    would not.
585    <S {Lear}.> He would not?
586   *<S {Knight}.> My Lord, I know not what the matter is,
587   *but to my iudgement your Highnesse is not entertain'd
588   *with that Ceremonious affection as you were wont,
589   *theres a great abatement of kindnesse appeares as well in
590   *the generall dependants, as in the Duke himselfe also, and
591    your Daughter.
592    <S {Lear}.> Ha? Saist thou so?
593   *<S {Knigh}.> I beseech you pardon me my Lord, if I bee
594   *mistaken, for my duty cannot be silent, when I thinke
595    your Highnesse wrong'd.
596   *<S {Lear}.> Thou but remembrest me of mine owne Con-ception,
597   *I haue perceiued a most faint neglect of late,
598   *which I haue rather blamed as mine owne iealous curio-sitie,
599   *then as a very pretence and purpose of vnkindnesse;
600   *I will looke further intoo't: but where's my Foole? I
601    haue not seene him this two daies.
602   *<S {Knight}.> Since my young Ladies going into {France}
      <P qq4v>
603    Sir, the Foole hath much pined away.
604   *<S {Lear}.> No more of that, I haue noted it well, goe you
605   *and tell my Daughter, I would speake with her. Goe you
606   *call hither my Foole; Oh you Sir, you, come you hither
607    Sir, who am I Sir?
608    <D {Enter Steward}.>
609    <S {Ste}.> My Ladies Father.
610   *<S {Lear}.> My Ladies Father? my Lords knaue, you whor-son
611    dog, you slaue, you curre.
612    <S {Ste}.> I am none of these my Lord,
613    I beseech your pardon.
614    <S {Lear}.> Do you bandy lookes with me, you Rascall?
615    <S {Ste}.> Ile not be strucken my Lord.
616    <S {Kent}.> Nor tript neither, you base Foot- ball plaier.
617    <S {Lear}.> I thanke thee fellow.
618    Thou seru'st me, and Ile loue thee.
619   *<S {Kent}.> Come sir, arise, away, Ile teach you differences:
620   *away, away, if you will measure your lubbers length a-gaine,
621    tarry, but away, goe #too, haue you wisedome, so.
622   *<S {Lear}.> Now my friendly knaue I thanke thee, there's
623    earnest of thy seruice.
624    <D {Enter Foole}.>
625    <S {Foole}.> Let me hire him too, here's my Coxcombe.
626    <S {Lear}.> How now my pretty knaue, how dost thou?
627    <S {Foole}.> Sirrah, you were best take my Coxcombe.
628    <S {Lear}.> Why my Boy?
629   *<S {Foole}.> Why? for taking ones part that's out of fauour,
630   *nay, #& thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch
631   *colde shortly, there take my Coxcombe; why this fellow
632   *ha's banish'd two on's Daughters, and did the third a
633   *blessing against his #will, if thou follow him, thou must
634   *needs weare my Coxcombe. How now Nunckle? would
635    I had two Coxcombes and two Daughters.
636    <S {Lear}.> Why my Boy?
637   *<S {Fool}.> If I gaue them all my liuing, I'ld keepe my Cox-combes
638   *my selfe, there's mine, beg another of thy
639    Daughters.
640    <S {Lear}.> Take heed Sirrah, the whip.
641   *<S {Foole}.> Truth's a dog must to kennell, hee must bee
642   *whipt out, when the Lady Brach may stand by'th' fire
643    and stinke.
644    <S {Lear}.> A pestilent gall to me.
645    <S {Foole}.> Sirha, Ile teach thee a speech.
646    <S {Lear}.> Do.
647    <S {Foole}.> Marke it Nuncle;
648    Haue more then thou showest,
649    Speake lesse then thou knowest,
650    Lend lesse then thou owest,
651    Ride more then thou goest,
652    Learne more then thou trowest,
653    Set lesse then thou throwest;
654    Leaue thy drinke and thy whore,
655    And keepe in a dore,
656    And thou shalt haue more,
657    Then two tens to a score.
658    <S {Kent}.> This is nothing Foole.
659   *<S {Foole}.> Then 'tis like the breath of an vnfeed Lawyer,
660   *you gaue me nothing for't, can you make no vse of no-thing
661    Nuncle?
662    <S {Lear}.> Why no Boy,
663    Nothing can be made out of nothing.
664   *<S {Foole}.> Prythee tell him, so much the rent of his land
665    comes to, he will not beleeue a Foole.
666    <S {Lear}.> A bitter Foole.
667   *<S {Foole}.> Do'st thou know the difference my Boy, be-tweene
668    a bitter Foole, and a sweet one.
669    <S {Lear}.> No Lad, teach me.
670   *<S {Foole}.> Nunckle, giue me an egge, and Ile giue thee
671    two Crownes.
672    <S {Lear}.> What two Crownes shall they be?
673   *<S {Foole}.> Why after I haue cut the egge i'th' middle and
674   *eate vp the meate, the two Crownes of the egge: when
675   *thou clouest thy Crownes i'th' middle, and gau'st away
676   *both parts, thou boar'st thine Asse on thy backe o're the
677   *durt, thou hadst little wit in thy bald crowne, when thou
678   *gau'st thy golden one away; if I speake like my selfe in
679    this, let him be whipt that first findes it so.
680    Fooles had nere lesse grace in a yeere,
681    For wisemen are growne foppish,
682    And know not how their wits to weare,
683    Their manners are so apish.
684   *<S {Le}.> When were you wont to be so full of Songs sirrah?
685   *<S {Foole}.> I haue vsed it Nunckle, ere since thou mad'st
686   *thy Daughters thy Mothers, for when thou gau'st them
687   *the rod, and put'st downe thine owne breeches, then they
688    For sodaine ioy did weepe,
689    And I for sorrow sung,
690    That such a King should play bo- peepe,
691    And goe the Foole among.
692   *Pry'thy Nunckle keepe a Schoolemaster that can teach
693    thy Foole to lie, I would faine learne to lie.
694    <S {Lear}.> #And you lie sirrah, wee'l haue you whipt.
695   *<S {Foole}.> I maruell what kin thou and thy daughters are,
696   *they'l haue me whipt for speaking true: thou'lt haue me
697   *whipt for lying, and sometimes I am whipt for holding
698   *my peace. I had rather be any kind #o' thing then a foole,
699   *and yet I would not be thee Nunckle, thou hast pared thy
700   *wit #o' both sides, and left nothing i'th' middle; heere
701    comes one o'the parings.
702    <D {Enter Gonerill}.>
703   *<S {Lear}.> How now Daughter? what makes that Frontlet
704    on? You are too much of late i'th' frowne.
705   *<S {Foole}.> Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no
706   *need to care for her frowning, now thou art an #O with-out
707   *a figure, I am better then thou art now, I am a Foole,
708   *thou art nothing. Yes forsooth I will hold my tongue, so
709    your face bids me, though  you say nothing.
710    Mum, mum, he that keepes nor crust, nor crum,
711    Weary of all, shall want some. That's a sheal'd Pescod.
712    <S {Gon}.> Not only Sir this, your all- lycenc'd Foole,
713    But other of your insolent retinue
714    Do hourely Carpe and Quarrell, breaking forth
715    In ranke, and (not to be endur'd) riots Sir.
716    I had thought by making this well knowne vnto you,
717    To haue found a safe redresse, but now grow fearefull
718    By what your selfe too late haue spoke and done,
719    That you protect this course, and put it on
720    By your allowance, which if you should, the fault
721    Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleepe,
722    Which in the tender of a wholesome weale,
723    Mighty in their working do you that offence,
724    Which else were shame, that then necessitie
725    Will call discreet proceeding.
726   *<S {Foole}.> For you know Nunckle, the Hedge- Sparrow
727   *fed the Cuckoo so long, that it's had #it head bit off by #it
728   *young, so out went the Candle, and we were left dark-ling.
729   _
730    <S {Lear}.> Are you our Daughter?
731   *<S {Gon}.> I would you would make vse of your good wise-|(dome
732    (Whereof I know you are fraught), and put away
733    These dispositions, which of late transport you
734    From what you rightly are.
      <P qq5><C B>
735   *<S {Foole}.> May not an Asse know, when the Cart drawes
736    the Horse?
737    Whoop Iugge I loue thee.
738    <S {Lear}.> Do's any heere know me?
739    This is not {Lear}:
740   *Do's  {Lear} walke thus? Speake thus? Where are his eies?
741    Either his Notion weakens, his Discernings
742    Are Lethargied. Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so?
743    Who is it that can tell me who I am?
744    <S {Foole}.> {Lears} shadow.
745    <S {Lear}.> Your name, faire Gentlewoman?
746    <S {Gon}.> This admiration Sir, is much o'th' sauour
747    Of other your new prankes. I do beseech you
748    To vnderstand my purposes aright:
749    As you are Old, and Reuerend, should be Wise.
750    Heere do you keepe a hundred Knights and Squires,
751    Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
752    That this our Court infected with their manners,
753    Shewes like a riotous Inne; Epicurisme and Lust
754    Makes it more like a Tauerne, or a Brothell,
755    Then a grac'd Pallace. The shame it selfe doth speake
756    For instant remedy. Be then desir'd
757    By her, that else will take the thing she begges,
758    A little to disquantity your Traine,
759    And the remainders that shall still depend,
760    To be such men as may besort your Age,
761    Which know themselues, and you.
762    <S {Lear}.> Darknesse, and Diuels.
763    Saddle my horses: call my Traine together.
764    Degenerate Bastard, Ile not trouble thee;
765    Yet haue I left a daughter.
766   *<S {Gon}.> You strike my people, and your disorder'd rable,
767    make Seruants of their Betters.
768    <D {Enter Albany}.>
769    <S {Lear}.> Woe, that too late repents:
770    Is it your #will, speake Sir? Prepare my Horses.
771    Ingratitude! thou Marble- hearted Fiend,
772    More hideous when thou shew'st thee in a Child,
773    Then the Sea- monster.
774    <S {Alb}.> Pray Sir be patient.
775    <S {Lear}.> Detested Kite, thou lyest.
776    My Traine are men of choice, and rarest parts,
777    That all particulars of dutie know,
778    And in the most exact regard, support
779    The worships of their name. O most small fault,
780    How vgly did'st thou in {Cordelia} shew?
781    Which like an Engine, wrencht my frame of Nature
782    From the fixt place: drew from my heart all loue,
783    And added to the gall. O {Lear, Lear, Lear}!
784    Beate at this gate that let thy Folly in,
785    And thy deere Iudgement out. Go, go, my people.
786    <S {Alb}.> My Lord, I am guiltlesse, as I am ignorant
787    Of what hath moued you.
788    <S {Lear}.> It may be so, my Lord.
789    Heare Nature, heare deere Goddesse, heare:
790    Suspend thy purpose, if thou did'st intend
791    To make this Creature fruitfull:
792    Into her Wombe conuey stirrility,
793    Drie vp in her the Organs of increase,
794    And from her derogate body, neuer spring
795    A Babe to honor her. If she must teeme,
796    Create her childe of Spleene, that it may liue
797    And be #a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
798    Let it stampe wrinkles in her brow of youth,
799    With cadent Teares fret Channels in her cheekes,
800    Turne all her Mothers paines, and benefits
801    To laughter, and contempt: That she may feele,
802    How sharper then a Serpents tooth it is,
803    To haue a thanklesse Childe. Away, away.  <D {Exit}.>
804    <S {Alb}.> Now Gods that we adore,
805    Whereof comes this?
806    <S {Gon}.> Neuer afflict your selfe to know more of it:
807    But let his disposition haue that scope
808    As dotage giues it.
809    <D {Enter Lear}.>
810    <S {Lear}.> What fiftie of my Followers at a clap?
811    Within a fortnight?
812    <S {Alb}.> What's the matter, Sir?
813    <S {Lear}.> Ile tell thee:
814    Life and death, I am asham'd
815    That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,
816    That these hot teares, which breake from me perforce
817    Should make thee worth them.
818    Blastes and Fogges vpon thee:
819    Th' vntented woundings of a Fathers curse
820    Pierce euerie sense about thee. Old fond eyes,
821    Beweepe this cause againe, Ile plucke ye out,
822    And cast you with the waters that you loose
823    To temper Clay. Ha? Let it be so.
824    I haue another daughter,
825    Who I am sure is kinde and comfortable:
826    When she shall heare this of thee, with her nailes
827    Shee'l flea thy Woluish visage. Thou shalt finde,
828    That Ile resume the shape which thou dost thinke
829    I haue cast off for euer.  <D {Exit}>
830    <S {Gon}.> Do you marke that?
831    <S {Alb}.> I cannot be so partiall {Gonerill},
832    To the great loue I beare you.
833    <S {Gon}.> Pray you content. What {Oswald}, hoa?
834    You Sir, more Knaue then Foole, after your Master.
835    <S {Foole}.> Nunkle {Lear}, Nunkle {Lear},
836    Tarry, take the Foole with thee:
837    A Fox, when one has caught her,
838    And such a Daughter,
839    Should sure to the Slaughter,
840    If my Cap would buy a Halter,
841    So the Foole followes after.  <D {Exit}>
842    <S {Gon}.> This man hath had good Counsell,
843    A hundred Knights?
844    'Tis politike, and safe to let him keepe
845   *At point a hundred Knights: yes, that on euerie dreame,
846    Each buz, each fancie, each complaint, dislike,
847    He may enguard his dotage with their powres,
848    And hold our liues in mercy. {Oswald}, I say.
849    <S {Alb}.> Well, you may feare too farre.
850    <S {Gon}.> Safer then trust too farre;
851    Let me still take away the harmes I feare,
852    Not feare still to be taken. I know his heart,
853    What he hath vtter'd I haue writ my Sister:
854    If she sustaine him, and his hundred Knights
855    When I haue shew'd th' vnfitnesse.
856    <D {Enter Steward}.>
857    How now {Oswald}?
858    What haue you writ that Letter to my Sister?
859    <S {Stew}.> #I Madam.
860    <S {Gon}.> Take you some company, and away to horse,
861    Informe her full of my particular feare,
862    And thereto adde such reasons of your owne,
863    As may compact it more. Get you gone,
      <P qq5v><C E>
864    And hasten your returne; no, no, my Lord,
865    This milky gentlenesse, and course of yours
866    Though I condemne not, yet vnder pardon
867    You are much more at task for want of wisedome,
868    Then prais'd for harmefull mildnesse.
869    <S {Alb}.> How farre your eies may pierce I cannot tell;
870    Striuing to better, oft we marre what's well.
871    <S {Gon}.> Nay then===
872    <S {Alb}.> Well, well, th' euent.  <D {Exeunt}>
873    <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
874    <D {Enter Lear, Kent, Gentleman, and Foole}.>
875   *<S {Lear}.> Go you before to {Gloster} with these Letters;
876   *acquaint my Daughter no further with any thing you
877   *know, then comes from her demand out of the Letter,
878   *if your Dilligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore
879    you.
880   *<S {Kent}.> I will not sleepe my Lord, till I haue deliuered
881    your Letter.  <D {Exit}.>
882   *<S {Foole}.> If a mans braines were in's heeles, #wert not in
883    danger of kybes?
884    <S {Lear}.> #I Boy.
885   *<S {Foole}.> Then I prythee be merry, thy wit shall not go
886    slip- shod.
887    <S {Lear}.> Ha, ha, ha.
888   *<S {Fool}.> Shalt see thy other Daughter will vse thee kind-ly,
889   *for though she's as like this, as a Crabbe's like an
890    Apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
891    <S {Lear}.> What can'st tell Boy?
892   *<S {Foole}.> She will taste as like this as, a Crabbe do's to a
893   *Crab: thou canst, tell why ones nose stands i'th' middle
894    on's face?
895    <S {Lear}.> No.
896   *<S {Foole}.> Why to keepe ones eyes of either side 's nose,
897    that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
898    <S {Lear}.> I did her wrong.
899    <S {Foole}.> Can'st tell how an Oyster makes his shell?
900    <S {Lear}.> No.
901   *<S {Foole}.> Nor I neither; but I can tell why a Snaile ha's
902    a house.
903    <S {Lear}.> Why?
904   *<S {Foole}.> Why to put's head in, not to giue it away to his
905    daughters, and leaue his hornes without a case.
906   *<S {Lear}.> I will forget my Nature, so kind a Father? Be
907    my Horsses ready?
908   *<S {Foole}.> Thy Asses are gone about 'em; the reason why
909   *the seuen Starres are no mo then seuen, is a pretty reason.
910    <S {Lear}.> Because they are not eight.
911   *<S {Foole}.> Yes indeed, thou would'st make a good Foole.
912   *<S {Lear}.> To tak't againe perforce; Monster Ingratitude!
913   *<S {Foole}.> If thou wert my Foole Nunckle, Il'd haue thee
914    beaten for being old before thy time.
915    <S {Lear}.> How's that?
916   *<S {Foole}.> Thou shouldst not haue bin old, till thou hadst
917    bin wise.
918   *<S {Lear}.> O let me not be mad, not mad sweet Heauen:
919   *keepe me in temper, I would not be mad. How now are
920    the Horses ready?
921    <S {Gent}.> Ready my Lord.
922    <S {Lear}.> Come Boy.
923   *<S {Fool}.> She that's a Maid now, & laughs at my departure,
924    Shall not be a Maid long, vnlesse things be cut shorter.

929    <S {Cur}.> And you Sir, I haue bin
930    With your Father, and giuen him notice
931    That the Duke of {Cornwall}, and {Regan} his Duchesse
932    Will be here with him this night.
933    <S {Bast}.> How comes that?
934   *<S {Cur}.> Nay I know not, you haue heard of the newes a-broad,
935   *I meane the whisper'd ones, for they are yet but
936    ear- kissing arguments.
937    <S {Bast}.> Not I: pray you what are they?
938    <S {Cur}.> Haue you heard of no likely Warres toward,
939    'Twixt the Dukes of {Cornwall}, and {Albany}?
940    <S {Bast}.> Not a word.
941    <S {Cur}.> You may do then in time,
942    Fare you well Sir.  <D {Exit}.>
943    <S {Bast}.> The Duke be here to night? The better best,
944    This weaues it selfe perforce into my businesse,
945    My Father hath set guard to take my Brother,
946    And I haue one thing of a queazie question
947    Which I must act, Briefenesse, and Fortune worke.
948    <D {Enter Edgar}.>
949    Brother, a word, discend; Brother I say,
950    My Father watches: O Sir, fly this place,
951    Intelligence is giuen where you are hid;
952    You haue now the good aduantage of the night,
953    Haue you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of {Cornewall}?
954    Hee's comming hither, now i'th' night, i'th' haste,
955    And {Regan} with him, haue you nothing said
956    Vpon his partie 'gainst the Duke of {Albany}?
957    Aduise your selfe.
958    <S {Edg}.> I am sure on't, not a word.
959    <S {Bast}.> I heare my Father comming, pardon me:
960    In cunning, I must draw my Sword vpon you:
961    Draw, seeme to defend your selfe,
962    Now quit you well.
963    Yeeld, come before my Father, light hoa, here,
964    Fly Brother, Torches, Torches, so farewell.
965    <D {Exit Edgar}.>
966    Some blood drawne on me, would beget opinion
967    Of my more fierce endeauour. I haue seene drunkards
968    Do more then this in sport; Father, Father,
969    Stop, stop, no helpe?
970    <D {Enter Gloster, and Seruants with Torches}.>
971    <S {Glo}.> Now {Edmund}, where's the villaine?
972   *<S {Bast}.> Here stood he in the dark, his sharpe Sword out,
973    Mumbling of wicked charmes, coniuring the Moone
974    To stand auspicious Mistris.
975    <S {Glo}.> But where is he?
976    <S {Bast}.> Looke Sir, I bleed.
977    <S {Glo}.> Where is the villaine, {Edmund}?
978   *<S {Bast}.> Fled this way Sir, when by no meanes he could.
979    <S {Glo}.> Pursue him, ho: go after. By no meanes, what?
980   *<S {Bast}.> Perswade me to the murther of your Lordship,
      <P qq6>
981    But that I told him the reuenging Gods,
982    'Gainst Paricides did all the thunder bend,
983    Spoke with how manifold, and strong a Bond
984    The Child was bound to'th' Father; Sir in fine,
985    Seeing how lothly opposite I stood
986    To his vnnaturall purpose, in fell motion
987    With his prepared Sword, he charges home
988    My vnprouided body, latch'd mine arme;
989    And when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
990    Bold in the quarrels right, rouz'd to th' encounter,
991    Or whether gasted by the noyse I made,
992    Full sodainely he fled.
993    <S {Glost}.> Let him fly farre:
994    Not in this Land shall he remaine vncaught
995    And found; dispatch, the Noble Duke my Master,
996    My worthy Arch and Patron comes to night,
997    By his authoritie I will proclaime it,
998    That he which finds him shall deserue our thankes,
999    Bringing the murderous Coward to the stake:
1000   He that conceales him death.
1001   <S {Bast}.> When I disswaded him from his intent,
1002   And found him pight to doe it, with curst speech
1003   I threaten'd to discouer him; he replied,
1004   Thou vnpossessing Bastard, dost thou thinke,
1005   If I would stand against thee, would the reposall
1006   Of any trust, vertue, or worth in thee
1007   Make thy words faith'd? No, what should I denie,
1008   (As this I would, though thou didst produce
1009   My very Character) I'ld turne it all
1010   To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
1011   And thou must make a dullard of the world,
1012   If they not thought the profits of my death
1013   Were very pregnant and potentiall spirits
1014   To make thee seeke it.  <D {Tucket within}.>
1015   <S {Glo}.> O strange and fastned Villaine,
1016   Would he deny his Letter, said he?
1017  *Harke, the Dukes Trumpets, I know not wher he comes;
1018   All Ports Ile barre, the villaine shall not scape,
1019   The Duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
1020   I will send farre and neere, that all the kingdome
1021   May haue due note of him, and of my land,
1022   (Loyall and naturall Boy) Ile worke the meanes
1023   To make thee capable.
1024   <D {Enter Cornewall, Regan, and Attendants}.>
1025  *<S {Corn}.> How now my Noble friend, since I came hither
1026   (Which I can call but now,) I haue heard strangenesse.
1027   <S {Reg}.> If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
1028   Which can pursue th' offender; how dost my Lord?
1029   <S {Glo}.> O Madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd.
1030  *<S {Reg}.> What, did my Fathers Godsonne seeke your life?
1031   He whom my Father nam'd, your {Edgar}?
1032   <S {Glo}.> O Lady, Lady, shame would haue it hid.
1033  *<S {Reg}.> Was he not companion with the riotous Knights
1034   That tended vpon my Father?
1035   <S {Glo}.> I know not Madam, 'tis too bad, too bad.
1036   <S {Bast}.> Yes Madam, he was of that consort.
1037   <S {Reg}.> No maruaile then, though he were #ill affected,
1038   'Tis they haue put him on the old mans death,
1039   To haue th' expence and #wast of his Reuenues:
1040   I haue this present euening from my Sister
1041   Beene well inform'd of them, and with such cautions,
1042   That if they come to soiourne at my house,
1043   Ile not be there.
1044   <S {Cor}.> Nor I, assure thee {Regan};
1045   {Edmund}, I heare that you haue shewne your Father
1046   A Child- like Office.
1047   <S {Bast}.> It was my duty Sir.
1048   <S {Glo}.> He did bewray his practise, and receiu'd
1049   This hurt you see, striuing to apprehend him.
1050   <S {Cor}.> Is he pursued?
1051   <S {Glo}.> #I my good Lord.
1052   <S {Cor}.> If he be taken, he shall neuer more
1053   Be fear'd of doing harme, make your owne purpose,
1054   How in my strength you please: for you {Edmund},
1055   Whose vertue and obedience doth this instant
1056   So much commend it selfe, you shall be ours,
1057   Nature's of such deepe trust, we shall much need:
1058   You we first seize on.
1059   <S {Bast}.> I shall serue you Sir truely, how euer else.
1060   <S {Glo}.> For him I thanke your Grace.
1061   <S {Cor}.> You know not why we came to visit you?
1062  *<S {Reg}.> Thus out of season, thredding darke ey'd night,

1064   Wherein we must haue vse of your aduise.

1111  *Ile so carbonado your shanks, draw you Rascall, come
1112   your waies.
1113   <S {Ste}.> Helpe, ho, murther, helpe.
1114  *<S {Kent}.> Strike you slaue: stand rogue, stand you neat
1115   slaue, strike.
1116   <S {Stew}.> Helpe hoa, murther, murther.
1117   <D {Enter Bastard, Cornewall, Regan, Gloster, Seruants}.>
1118   <S {Bast}.> How now, what's the matter? Part.
1119  *<S {Kent}.> With you goodman Boy, if you please, come,
1120   Ile flesh ye, come on yong Master.
1121   <S {Glo}.> Weapons? Armes? what's the matter here?
1122  *<S {Cor}.> Keepe peace vpon your liues, he dies that strikes
1123   againe, what is the matter?
1124  *<S {Reg}.> The Messengers from our Sister, and the King?
1125   <S {Cor}.> What is your difference, speake?
1126   <S {Stew}.> I am scarce in breath my Lord.
1127  *<S {Kent}.> No Maruell, you haue so bestir'd your valour,
1128  *you cowardly Rascall, nature disclaimes in thee: a Taylor
1129   made thee.
1130  *<S {Cor}.> Thou art a strange fellow, a Taylor make a man?
1131  *<S {Kent}.> A Taylor Sir, a Stone- cutter, or a Painter, could
1132  *not haue made him so #ill, though they had bin but two
1133   yeares oth' trade.
1134   <S {Cor}.> Speake yet, how grew your quarrell?
1135  *<S {Ste}.> This ancient Ruffian Sir, whose life I haue spar'd
1136   at sute of his gray- beard.
1137  *<S {Kent}.> Thou whoreson Zed, thou vnnecessary letter:
1138  *my Lord, if you will giue me leaue, I will tread this vn-boulted
1139  *villaine into morter, and daube the wall of a
1140   Iakes with him. Spare my gray- beard, you wagtaile?
1141   <S {Cor}.> Peace sirrah,
1142   You beastly knaue, know you no reuerence?
1143   <S {Kent}.> Yes Sir, but anger hath a priuiledge.
1144   <S {Cor}.> Why art thou angrie?
1145  *<S {Kent}.> That such a slaue as this should weare a Sword,
1146   Who weares no honesty: such smiling rogues as these,
1147   Like Rats oft bite the holy cords #a twaine,
1148   Which are t' intrince, t' vnloose: smooth euery passion
1149   That in the natures of their Lords rebell,
1150   Being oile to fire, snow to the colder moodes,
1151   Reuenge, affirme, and turne their Halcion beakes
1152   With euery gall, and varry of their Masters,
1153   Knowing naught (like dogges) but following:
1154   A plague vpon your Epilepticke visage,
1155   Smoile you my speeches, as I were a Foole?
1156   Goose, if I had you vpon {Sarum} Plaine,
1157   I'ld driue ye cackling home to {Camelot}.
1158   <S {Corn}.> What art thou mad old Fellow?
1159   <S {Glost}.> How fell you out, say that?
1160   <S {Kent}.> No contraries hold more antipathy,
1161   Then I, and such a knaue.
1162   <S {Corn}.> Why do'st thou call him Knaue?
1163   What is his fault?
1164   <S {Kent}.> His countenance likes me not.
1165  *<S {Cor}.> No more perchance do's mine, nor his, nor hers.
1166   <S {Kent}.> Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plaine,
1167   I haue seene better faces in my Time,
1168   Then stands on any shoulder that I see
1169   Before me, at this instant.
1170   <S {Corn}.> This is some Fellow,
1171   Who hauing beene prais'd for bluntnesse, doth affect
1172   A saucy roughnes, and constraines the garb
1173   Quite from his Nature. He cannot flatter he,
1174   An honest mind and plaine, he must speake truth,
1175   And they will take it so, if not, hee's plaine.
1176   These kind of Knaues I know, which in this plainnesse
1177   Harbour more craft, and more corrupter ends,
1178   Then twenty silly- ducking obseruants,
1179   That stretch their duties nicely.
1180   <S {Kent}.> Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
1181   Vnder th' allowance of your great aspect,
1182   Whose influence like the wreath of radient fire
1183   On flickring {Phoebus} front.
1184   <S {Corn}.> What mean'st by this?
1185  *<S {Kent}.> To go out of my dialect, which you discom-mend
1186  *so much; I know Sir, I am no flatterer, he that be-guild
1187  *you in a plaine accent, was a plaine Knaue, which
1188  *for my part I will not be, though I should win your
1189   displeasure to entreat me too't.
1190   <S {Corn}.> What was th' offence you gaue him?
1191   <S {Ste}.> I neuer gaue him any:
1192   It pleas'd the King his Master very late
1193   To strike at me vpon his misconstruction,
1194   When he compact, and flattering his displeasure
1195   Tript me behind: being downe, insulted, rail'd,
1196   And put vpon him such a deale of Man,
1197   That worthied him, got praises of the King,
1198   For him attempting, who was selfe- subdued,
1199   And in the fleshment of this dead exploit,
1200   Drew on me here againe.
1201   <S {Kent}.> None of these Rogues, and Cowards
1202   But {Aiax} is there Foole.
1203   <S {Corn}.> Fetch forth the Stocks?
1204   You stubborne ancient Knaue, you reuerent Bragart,
1205   Wee'l teach you.
1206   <S {Kent}.> Sir, I am too old to learne:
1207   Call not your Stocks for me, I serue the King.
1208   On whose imployment I was sent to you,
1209   You shall doe small respects, show too bold malice
1210   Against the Grace, and Person of my Master,
1211   Stocking his Messenger.
1212   <S {Corn}.> Fetch forth the Stocks;
1213   As I haue life and Honour, there shall he sit till Noone.
1214  *<S {Reg}.> Till noone? till night my Lord, and all night too.
1215   <S {Kent}.> Why Madam, if I were your Fathers dog,
1216   You should not vse me so.
1217   <S {Reg}.> Sir, being his Knaue, I will.  <D {Stocks brought out}.>
1218   <S {Cor}.> This is a Fellow of the selfe same colour,
1219   Our Sister speakes of. Come, bring away the Stocks.
1220   <S {Glo}.> Let me beseech your Grace, not to do so,
1221   The King his Master, needs must take it #ill
1222   That he so slightly valued in his Messenger,
1223   Should haue him thus restrained.
1224   <S {Cor}.> Ile answere that.
1225   <S {Reg}.> My Sister may recieue it much more worsse,
1226   To haue her Gentleman abus'd, assaulted.
1227   <S {Corn}.> Come my Lord, away.  <D {Exit}.>
1228  *<S {Glo}.> I am sorry for thee friend, 'tis the Dukes pleasure,
1229   Whose disposition all the world well knowes
1230   Will not be rub'd nor stopt, Ile entreat for thee.
1231  *<S {Kent}.> Pray do not Sir, I haue watch'd and trauail'd hard,
1232   Some time I shall sleepe out, the rest Ile whistle:
1233   A good mans fortune may grow out at heeles:
      <P rr1>
1234   Giue you good morrow.
1235   <S {Glo}.> The Duke's #too blame in this,
1236   'Twill be #ill taken.  <D {Exit}.>
1237  *<S {Kent}.> Good King, that must approue the common saw,
1238   Thou out of Heauens benediction com'st
1239   To the warme Sun.
1240   Approach thou Beacon to this vnder Globe,
1241   That by thy comfortable Beames I may
1242   Peruse this Letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
1243   But miserie. I know 'tis from {Cordelia},
1244   Who hath most fortunately beene inform'd
1245   Of my obscured course. And shall finde time
1246   From this enormous State, seeking to giue
1247   Losses their remedies. All weary and o're- watch'd,
1248   Take vantage heauie eyes, not to behold
1249   This shamefull lodging. Fortune goodnight,
1250   Smile once more, turne thy wheele.
1251   <D {Enter Edgar}.>
1252   <S {Edg}.> I heard my selfe proclaim'd,
1253   And by the happy hollow of a Tree,
1254   Escap'd the hunt. No Port is free, no place
1255   That guard, and most vnusall vigilance
1256   Do's not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape
1257   I will preserue myselfe: and am bethought
1258   To take the basest, and most poorest shape
1259   That euer penury in contempt of man,
1260   Brought neere to beast; my face Ile grime with filth,
1261   Blanket my loines, else all my haires in knots,
1262   And with presented nakednesse  out- face
1263   The Windes, and persecutions of the skie;
1264   The Country giues me proofe, and president
1265   Of Bedlam beggers, who with roaring voices,
1266   Strike in their num'd and mortified Armes.
1267   Pins, Wodden- prickes, Nayles, Sprigs of Rosemarie:
1268   And with this horrible obiect, from low Farmes,
1269   Poore pelting Villages, Sheeps- Coates, and Milles,
1270  *Sometimes with Lunaticke bans, sometime with Praiers
1271   Inforce their charitie: poore {Turlygod} poore {Tom},
1272   That's something yet: {Edgar} I nothing am.  <D {Exit}.>
1273   <D {Enter Lear, Foole, and Gentleman}.>
1274  *<S {Lea}.> 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
1275   And not send backe my Messengers.
1276   <S {Gent}.> As I learn'd,
1277   The night before, there was no purpose in them
1278   Of this remoue.
1279   <S {Kent}.> Haile to thee Noble Master.
1280   <S {Lear}.> Ha? Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?
1281   <S {Kent}.> No my Lord.
1282  *<S {Foole}.> Hah, ha, he weares Cruell Garters Horses are
1283  *tide by the heads, Dogges and Beares by'th' necke,
1284  *Monkies by'th' loynes, and Men by'th' legs: when a man
1285  *ouerlustie at legs, then he weares wodden nether- stocks.
1286   <S {Lear}.> What's he,
1287   That hath so much thy place mistooke
1288   To set thee heere?
1289   <S {Kent}.> It is both he and she,
1290   Your Son, and Daughter.
1291   <S {Lear}.> No.
1292   <S {Kent}.> Yes.
1293   <S {Lear}.> No I say.
1294   <S {Kent}.> I say yea.
1295   <S {Lear}.> By {Iupiter} I sweare no.
1296   <S {Kent}.> By {Iuno}, I sweare #I.
1297   <S {Lear}.> They durst not do't:
1298  *They could not, would not do't: 'tis worse then murther,
1299   To do vpon respect such violent outrage:
1300   Resolue me with all modest haste, which way
1301   Thou might'st deserue, or they impose this vsage,
1302   Comming from vs.
1303   <S {Kent}.> My Lord, when at their home
1304   I did commend your Highnesse Letters to them,
1305   Ere I was risen from the place, that shewed
1306   My dutie kneeling, came there a reeking Poste,
1307   Stew'd in his haste, halfe breathlesse, painting forth
1308   From {Gonerill} his Mistris, salutations;
1309   Deliuer'd Letters spight of intermission,
1310   Which presently they read; on those contents
1311   They summon'd vp their meiney, straight tooke Horse,
1312   Commanded me to follow, and attend
1313   The leisure of their answer, gaue me cold lookes,
1314   And meeting heere the other Messenger,
1315   Whose welcome I perceiu'd had poison'd mine,
1316   Being the very fellow which of late
1317   Displaid so sawcily against your Highnesse,
1318   Hauing more man then wit about me, drew;
1319   He rais'd the house, with loud and coward cries,
1320   Your Sonne and Daughter found this trespasse worth
1321   The shame which heere it suffers.
1322  *<S {Foole}.> Winters not gon yet, if the wil'd Geese fly that |(way,
1323  *Fathers that weare rags, do make their Children blind,
1324  *But Fathers that beare bags, shall see their children kind.
1325  *Fortune that arrant whore, nere turns the key toth' poore.
1326  *But for all this thou shalt haue as many Dolors for thy
1327   Daughters, as thou canst tell in a yeare.
1328  *<S {Lear}.> Oh how this Mother swels vp toward my heart!
1329   {Historica passio}, downe thou climing sorrow,
1330   Thy Elements below where is this Daughter?
1331   <S {Kent}.> With the Earle Sir, here within.
1332   <S {Lear}.> Follow me not, stay here.  <D {Exit}.>
1333   <S {Gen}.> Made you no more offence,
1334   But what you speake of?
1335   <S {Kent}.> None:
1336  *How chance  the King comes with so small a number?
1337  *<S {Foole}.> #And thou hadst beene set i'th' Stockes for that
1338   question, thoud'st well deseru'd it.
1339   <S {Kent}.> Why Foole?
1340  *<S {Foole}.> Wee'l set thee to schoole to an Ant, to teach
1341  *thee ther's no labouring i'th' winter. All that follow their
1342  *noses, are led by their eyes, but blinde men, and there's
1343  *not a nose among twenty, but can smell him that's stink-ing;
1344  *let go thy hold when a great wheele runs downe a
1345  *hill, least it breake thy necke with following. But the
1346  *great one that goes vpward, let him draw thee after:
1347  *when a wiseman giues thee better counsell giue me mine
1348  *againe, I would haue none but knaues follow it, since a
1349   Foole giues it.
1350   That #Sir, which serues and seekes for gaine,
1351   And followes but for forme;
1352   Will packe, when it begins to raine,
1353   And leaue thee in the storme,
1354   But I will tarry, the Foole will stay,
1355   And let the wiseman flie:
1356   The knaue turnes Foole that runnes away,
1357   The Foole no knaue perdie.
1358   <D {Enter Lear, and Gloster}>:
1359   <S {Kent}.> Where learn'd you this Foole?
1360   <S {Foole}.> Not i'th' Stocks Foole.
      <P rr1v>
1361   <S {Lear}.> Deny to speake with me?
1362   They are sicke, they are weary,
1363   They haue trauail'd all the night? meere fetches,
1364   The images of reuolt and flying off.
1365   Fetch me a better answer.
1366   <S {Glo}.> My deere Lord,
1367   You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
1368   How vnremoueable and fixt he is
1369   In his owne course.
1370   <S {Lear}.> Vengeance, Plague, Death, Confusion:
1371   Fiery? What quality? Why {Gloster, Gloster},
1372   I'ld speake with the Duke of {Cornewall}, and his wife.
1373   <S {Glo}.> Well my good Lord, I haue inform'd them so.
1374  *<S {Lear}.> Inform'd them? Do'st thou vnderstand me man.
1375   <S {Glo}.> #I my good Lord.
1376   <S {Lear}.> The King would speake with {Cornwall},
1377   The deere Father
1378  *Would with his Daughter speake, commands, tends, ser-|(uice,
1379   Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood:
1380   Fiery? The fiery Duke, tell the hot Duke that===
1381   No, but not yet, may be he is not well,
1382   Infirmity doth still neglect all office,
1383   Whereto our health is bound, we are not our selues,
1384   When Nature being opprest, commands the mind
1385   To suffer with the body; Ile forbeare,
1386   And am fallen out with my more headier #will,
1387   To take the indispos'd and sickly fit,
1388   For the sound man. Death on my state: wherefore
1389   Should he sit heere? This act perswades me,
1390   That this remotion of the Duke and her
1391   Is practise only. Giue me my Seruant forth;
1392   Goe tell the Duke, and's wife, Il'd speake with them:
1393   Now, presently: bid them come forth and heare me,
1394   Or at their Chamber doore Ile beate the Drum,
1395   Till it crie sleepe to death.
1396   <S {Glo}.> I would haue all well betwixt you.  <D {Exit}.>
1397  *<S {Lear}.> Oh me my heart! My rising heart! But downe.
1398  *<S {Foole}.> Cry to it Nunckle, as the Cockney did to the
1399  *Eeles, when she put 'em i'th' Paste aliue, she knapt 'em
1400  *o'th' coxcombs with a sticke, and cryed downe wantons,
1401  *downe; 'twas her Brother, that in pure kindnesse to his
1402   Horse buttered his Hay.
1403   <D {Enter Cornewall, Regan, Gloster, Seruants}.>
1404   <S {Lear}.> Good morrow to you both.
1405   <S {Corn}.> Haile to your Grace.  <D {Kent here set at liberty}.>
1406   <S {Reg}.> I am glad to see your Highnesse.
1407   <S {Lear}.> {Regan}, I thinke you are. I know what reason
1408   I haue to thinke so, if thou should'st not be glad,
1409   I would diuorce me from thy Mother Tombe,
1410   Sepulchring an Adultresse. O are you free?
1411   Some other time for that. Beloued {Regan},
1412   Thy Sisters naught: oh {Regan}, she hath tied
1413   Sharpe- tooth'd vnkindnesse, like a vulture heere,
1414   I can scarce speake to thee, thou'lt not beleeue
1415   With how deprau'd a quality. Oh {Regan}.
1416   <S {Reg}.> I pray you Sir, take patience, I haue hope
1417   You lesse know how to value her desert,
1418   Then she to scant her dutie.
1419   <S {Lear}.> Say? How is that?
1420   <S {Reg}.> I cannot thinke my Sister in the least
1421   Would faile her Obligation. If Sir perchance
1422   She haue restrained the Riots of your Followres,
1423   'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
1424   As cleeres her from all blame.
1425   <S {Lear}.> My curses on her.
      <C B>
1426   <S {Reg}.> O Sir, you are old,
1427   Nature in you stands on the very Verge
1428   Of his confine: you should be rul'd, and led
1429   By some discretion, that discernes your state
1430   Better then you your selfe: therefore I pray you,
1431   That to our Sister, you do make returne,
1432   Say you haue wrong'd her.
1433   <S {Lear}.> Aske her forgiuenesse?
1434   Do you but marke how this becomes the house?
1435   Deere daughter, I confesse that I am old;
1436   Age is vnnecessary: on my knees I begge,
1437   That you'l vouchsafe me Rayment, Bed, and Food.
1438  *<S {Reg}.> Good Sir, no more: these are vnsightly trickes:
1439   Returne you to my Sister.
1440   <S {Lear}.> Neuer {Regan}:
1441   She hath abated me of halfe my Traine;
1442   Look'd blacke vpon me, strooke me with her Tongue
1443   Most Serpent- like, vpon the very Heart.
1444   All the stor'd Vengeances of Heauen, fall
1445   On her ingratefull top: strike her yong bones
1446   You taking Ayres, with Lamenesse.
1447   <S {Corn}.> Fye sir, fie.
1448  *<S {Le}.> You nimble Lightnings, dart your blinding flames
1449   Into her scornfull eyes: Infect her Beauty,
1450  *You Fen- suck'd Fogges, drawne by the powrfull Sunne,
1451   To fall, and blister.
1452   <S {Reg}.> O the blest Gods!
1453   So will you wish on me, when the rash moode is on.
1454   <S {Lear}.>  No {Regan}, thou shalt neuer haue my curse:
1455   Thy tender- hefted Nature shall not giue
1456   Thee o're to harshnesse: Her eyes are fierce, but thine
1457   Do comfort, and not burne. 'Tis not in thee
1458   To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my Traine,
1459   To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
1460   And in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
1461   Against my comming in. Thou better know'st
1462   The Offices of Nature, bond of Childhood,
1463   Effects of Curtesie, dues of Gratitude:
1464   Thy halfe o'th' Kingdome hast thou not forgot,
1465   Wherein I thee endow'd.
1466   <S {Reg}.> Good Sir, to'th' purpose.  <D {Tucket within}.>
1467   <S {Lear}.> Who put my man i'th' Stockes?
1468   <D {Enter Steward}.>
1469   <S {Corn}.> What Trumpet's that?
1470   <S {Reg}.> I know't, my Sisters: this approues her Letter,
1471   That she would soone be heere. Is your Lady come?
1472   <S {Lear}.> This is a Slaue, whose easie borrowed pride
1473   Dwels in the sickly grace of her he followes.
1474   Out Varlet, from my sight.
1475   <S {Corn}.> What meanes your Grace?
1476   <D {Enter Gonerill}.>
1477  *<S {Lear}.> Who stockt my Seruant? {Regan}, I haue good hope
1478   Thou did'st not know on't.
1479   Who comes here? O Heauens!
1480   If you do loue old men; if your sweet sway
1481   Allow Obedience; if you your selues are old,
1482   Make it your cause: Send downe, and take my part.
1483   Art not asham'd to looke vpon this Beard?
1484   O {Regan}, will you take her by the hand?
1485  *<S {Gon}.> Why not by'th' hand Sir? How haue I offended?
1486   All's not offence that indiscretion findes,
1487   And dotage termes so.
1488   <S {Lear}.> O sides, you are too tough!
1489   Will you yet hold?
1490   How came my man i'th' Stockes?
1491   <S {Corn}.> I set him there, Sir: but his owne Disorders
      <P rr2><C E>
1492   Deseru'd much lesse aduancement.
1493   <S {Lear}.> You? Did you?
1494   <S {Reg}.> I pray you Father being weake, seeme so.
1495   If till the expiration of your Moneth
1496   You will returne and soiourne with my Sister,
1497   Dismissing halfe your traine, come then to me,
1498   I am now from home, and out of that prouision
1499   Which shall be needfull for your entertainement.
1500   <S {Lear}.> Returne to her? and fifty men dismiss'd?
1501   No, rather I abiure all roofes, and chuse
1502   To wage against the enmity oth' ayre,
1503   To be a Comrade with the Wolfe, and Owle,
1504   Necessities sharpe pinch. Returne with her?
1505   Why the hot- bloodied {France}, that dowerlesse tooke
1506   Our yongest borne, I could as well be brought
1507   To knee his Throne, and Squire- like pension beg,
1508   To keepe base life #a foote; returne with her?
1509   Perswade me rather to be slaue and sumpter
1510   To this detested groome.
1511   <S {Gon}.> At your choice Sir.
1512   <S {Lear}.> I prythee Daughter do not make me mad,
1513   I will not trouble thee my Child; farewell:
1514   Wee'l no more meete, no more see one another.
1515   But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my Daughter,
1516   Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
1517   Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a Byle,
1518   A plague sore, or imbossed Carbuncle
1519   In my corrupted blood. But Ile not chide thee,
1520   Let shame come when it will, I do not call it,
1521   I do not bid the Thunder- bearer shoote,
1522   Nor tell tales of thee to high- iudging {Ioue},
1523   Mend when thou can'st, be better at thy leisure,
1524   I can be patient, I can stay with {Regan},
1525   I and my hundred Knights.
1526   <S {Reg}.> Not altogether so,
1527   I look'd not for you yet, nor am prouided
1528   For your fit welcome, giue eare Sir to my Sister,
1529   For those that mingle reason with your passion,
1530   Must be content to thinke you old, and so,
1531   But she knowes what she doe's.
1532   <S {Lear}.> Is this well spoken?
1533   <S {Reg}.> I dare auouch it Sir, what fifty Followers?
1534   Is it not well? What should you need of more?
1535   Yea, or so many? Sith that both charge and danger,
1536   Speake 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
1537   Should many people, vnder two commands
1538   Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.
1539  *<S {Gon}.> Why might not you my Lord, receiue attendance
1540   From those that she cals Seruants, or from mine?
1541   <S {Reg}.> Why not my Lord?
1542   If then they chanc'd to slacke ye,
1543   We could comptroll them; if you will come to me,
1544   (For now I spie a danger) I entreate you
1545   To bring but fiue and twentie, to no more
1546   Will I giue place or notice.
1547   <S {Lear}.> I gaue you all.
1548   <S {Reg}.> And in good time you gaue it.
1549   <S {Lear}.> Made you my Guardians, my Depositaries,
1550   But kept a reseruation to be followed
1551   With such a number? What, must I come to you
1552   With fiue and twenty? {Regan}, said you so?
1553  *<S {Reg}.> And speak't againe my Lord, no more with me.
1554  *<S {Lea}.> Those wicked Creatures yet do look wel fauor'd
1555   When others are more wicked, not being the worst
1556   Stands in some ranke of praise, Ile go with thee,
1557   Thy fifty yet doth double fiue and twenty,
1558   And thou art twice her Loue.
1559   <S {Gon}.> Heare me my Lord;
1560   What need you fiue and twenty? Ten? Or fiue?
1561   To follow in a house, where twice so many
1562   Haue a command to tend you?
1563   <S {Reg}.> What need one?
1564   <S {Lear}.> O reason not the need: our basest Beggers
1565   Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
1566   Allow not Nature, more then Nature needs:
1567   Mans life is cheape as Beastes. Thou art a Lady;
1568   If onely to go warme were gorgeous,
1569   Why Nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
1570   Which scarcely keepes thee warme, but for true need:
1571   You Heauens, giue me that patience, patience I need,
1572   You see me heere (you Gods) a poore old man,
1573   As full of griefe as age, wretched in both,
1574   If it be you that stirres these Daughters hearts
1575   Against their Father, foole me not so much,
1576   To beare it tamely: touch me with Noble anger,
1577   And let not womens weapons, water drops,
1578   Staine my mans cheekes. No you vnnaturall Hags,
1579   I will haue such reuenges on you both,
1580   That all the world shall=== I will do such things,
1581   What they are yet, I know not, but they shalbe
1582   The terrors of the earth? you thinke Ile weepe,
1583   No, Ile not weepe, I haue full cause of weeping.
1584   <D {Storme and Tempest}.>
1585  *But this heart shal break into a hundred thousand flawes
1586   Or ere Ile weepe; O Foole, I shall go mad.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1587   <S {Corn}.> Let vs withdraw, 'twill be a Storme.
1588   <S {Reg}.> This house is little, the old man and's people,
1589   Cannot be well bestow'd.
1590  *<S {Gon}.> 'Tis his owne blame hath put himselfe from rest,
1591   And must needs taste his folly.
1592   <S {Reg}.> For his particular, Ile receiue him gladly,
1593   But not one follower.
1594   <S {Gon}.> So am I purpos'd,
1595   Where is my Lord of {Gloster}?
1596   <D {Enter Gloster}.>
1597   <S {Corn}.> Followed the old man forth, he is return'd.
1598   <S {Glo}.> The King is in high rage.
1599   <S {Corn}.> Whether is he going?
1600   <S {Glo}.> He cals to Horse, but will I know not whether.
1601   <S {Corn}.> 'Tis best to giue him way, he leads himselfe.
1602   <S {Gon}.> My Lord, entreate him by no meanes to stay.
1603  *<S {Glo}.> Alacke the night comes on, and the high windes
1604   Do sorely ruffle, for many Miles about
1605   There's scarce a Bush.
1606   <S {Reg}.> O Sir, to wilfull men,
1607   The iniuries that they themselues procure,
1608   Must be their Schoole- Masters: shut vp your doores,
1609   He is attended with a desperate traine,
1610   And what they may incense him #too, being apt,
1611   To haue his eare abus'd, wisedome bids feare.
1612  *<S {Cor}.> Shut vp your doores my Lord, 'tis a wil'd night,
1613  *My {Regan} counsels well: come out oth' storme.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1614   <Z {Actus Tertius. Scena Prima}.>
1615   <D {Storme still. Enter Kent, and a Gentleman, seuerally}.>
1616   <S {Kent}.> Who's there besides foule weather?
1617   <S {Gen}.> One minded like the weather, most vnquietly.
      <P rr2v><C B>
1618   <S {Kent}.> I know you: Where's the King?
1619   <S {Gent}.> Contending with the fretfull Elements;
1620   Bids the winde blow the Earth into the Sea,
1621   Or swell the curled Waters 'boue the Maine,
1622   That things might change, or cease.
1623   <S {Kent}.> But who is with him?
1624   <S {Gent}.> None but the Foole, who labours to out- iest
1625   His heart- strooke iniuries.
1626   <S {Kent}.> Sir, I do know you,
1627   And dare vpon the warrant of my note
1628   Commend a deere thing to you. There is diuision
1629   (Although as yet the face of it is couer'd
1630   With mutuall cunning) 'twixt Albany, and Cornwall:
1631   Who haue, as who haue not, that their great Starres
1632   Thron'd and set high; Seruants, who seeme no lesse,
1633   Which are to France the Spies and Speculations
1634   Intelligent of our State. What hath bin seene,
1635   Either in snuffes, and packings of the Dukes,
1636   Or the hard Reine which both of them hath borne
1637   Against the old kinde King; or something deeper,
1638   Whereof (perchance) these are but furnishings.
1639   <S {Gent}.> I will talke further with you.
1640   <S {Kent}.> No, do not:
1641   For confirmation that I am much more
1642   Then my out- wall; open this Purse, and take
1643   What it containes. If you shall see {Cordelia},
1644   (As feare not but you shall) shew her this Ring,
1645   And she will tell you who that Fellow is
1646   That yet you do not know. Fye on this Storme,
1647   I will go seeke the King.
1648   <S {Gent}.> Giue me your hand,
1649   Haue you no more to say?
1650   <S {Kent}.> Few words, but to effect more then all yet;
1651  *That when we haue found the King, in which your pain
1652   That way, Ile this: He that first lights on him,
1653   Holla the other.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1654   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
1655   <D {Storme still. Enter Lear, and Foole}.>
1656  *<S {Lear}.> Blow windes, & crack your cheeks; Rage, blow
1657   You Cataracts, and Hyrricano's spout,
1658  *Till you haue drench'd our Steeples, drown the Cockes.
1659   You Sulph'rous and Thought- executing Fires,
1660   Vaunt- curriors of Oake- cleauing Thunder- bolts,
1661  *Sindge my white head. And thou all- shaking Thunder,
1662   Strike flat the thicke Rotundity o'th' world,
1663   Cracke Natures moulds, all germaines spill at once
1664   That makes ingratefull Man.
1665  *<S {Foole}.> O Nunkle, Court holy- water in a dry house, is
1666  *better then this Rain- water out #o' doore. Good Nunkle,
1667  *in, aske thy Daughters blessing, heere's a night pitties
1668   neither Wisemen, nor Fooles.
1669  *<S {Lear}.> Rumble thy belly full: spit Fire, spowt Raine:
1670   Nor Raine, Winde, Thunder, Fire are my Daughters;
1671   I taxe not you, you Elements with vnkindnesse.
1672   I neuer gaue you Kingdome, call'd you Children;
1673   You owe me no subscription. Then let fall
1674   Your horrible pleasure. Heere I stand your Slaue,
1675   A poore, infirme, weake, and dispis'd old man:
1676   But yet I call you Seruile Ministers,
1677   That will with two pernicious Daughters ioyne
1678   Your high- engender'd Battailes, 'gainst a head
1679   So old, and white as this. O, ho! 'tis foule.
1680  *<S {Foole}.> He that has a house to put's head in, has a good
1681   Head- peece:
1682   The Codpiece that will house, before the head has any;
1683  *The Head, and he shall Lowse: so Beggers marry many.
1684  *The man y makes his Toe, what he his Hart shold make,
1685   Shall of a Corne cry woe, and turne his sleepe to wake.
1686  *For there was neuer yet faire woman, but shee made
1687   mouthes in a glasse.
1688   <D {Enter Kent}.>
1689   <S {Lear}.> No, I will be the patterne of all patience,
1690   I will say nothing.
1691   <S {Kent}.> Who's there?
1692  *<S {Foole}.> Marry here's Grace, and a Codpiece, that's a
1693   Wiseman, and a Foole.
1694   <S {Kent}.> Alas Sir are you here? Things that loue night,
1695   Loue not such nights as these: The wrathfull Skies
1696   Gallow the very wanderers of the darke
1697   And make them keepe their Caues: Since I was man,
1698   Such sheets of Fire, such bursts of horrid Thunder,
1699   Such groanes of roaring Winde, and Raine, I neuer
1700   Remember to haue heard. Mans Nature cannot carry
1701   Th' affliction, nor the feare.
1702   <S {Lear}.> Let the great Goddes
1703   That keepe this dreadfull pudder o're our heads,
1704   Finde out their enemies now. Tremble thou Wretch,
1705   That hast within thee vndivulged Crimes
1706   Vnwhipt of Iustice. Hide thee, thou Bloudy hand;
1707   Thou Periur'd, and thou Simular of Vertue
1708   That art Incestuous. Caytiffe, to peeces shake
1709   That vnder couert, and conuenient seeming
1710   Ha's practis'd on mans life. Close pent- vp guilts,
1711   Riue your concealing Continents, and cry
1712   These dreadfull Summoners grace. I am a man,
1713   More sinn'd against, then sinning.
1714   <S {Kent}.> Alacke, bare- headed?
1715   Gracious my Lord, hard by heere is a Houell,
1716   Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the Tempest:
1717   Repose you there, while I to this hard house,
1718   (More harder then the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,
1719   Which euen but now, demanding after you,
1720   Deny'd me to come in) returne, and force
1721   Their scanted curtesie.
1722   <S {Lear}.> My wits begin to turne.
1723   Come on my boy. How dost my boy? Art cold?
1724   I am cold my selfe. Where is this straw, my Fellow?
1725   The #Art of our Necessities is strange,
1726  *And can make vilde things precious. Come, your Houel;
1727   Poore Foole, and Knaue, I haue one part in my heart
1728   That's sorry yet for thee.
1729   <S {Foole}.> He that has #and a little- tyne wit,
1730   With heigh- ho, the Winde and the Raine,
1731   Must make content with his Fortunes fit,
1732   Though the Raine it raineth euery day.
1733  *<S {Le}.> True Boy: Come bring vs to this Houell.  <D {Exit}.>
1734   <S {Foole}.> This is a braue night to coole a Curtizan:
1735   Ile speake a Prophesie ere I go:
1736   When Priests are more in word, then matter;
1737   When Brewers marre their Malt with water;
1738   When Nobles are their Taylors Tutors,
1739   No Heretiques burn'd, but wenches Sutors;
1740   When euery Case in Law, is right;
1741   No Squire in debt, nor no poore Knight;
1742   When Slanders do not liue in Tongues;
1743   Nor Cut- purses come not to throngs;
1744   When Vsurers tell their Gold i'th' Field,
      <P rr3><C E>
1745   And Baudes, and whores, do Churches build,
1746  *Then shal the Realme of {Albion}, come to great confusion:
1747   Then comes the time, who liues to see't,
1748   That going shalbe vs'd with feet.
1749  *This prophecie {Merlin} shall make, for I liue before his |(time.
1750   <D {Exit}.>
1751   <Z {Scaena Tertia}.>
1752   <D {Enter Gloster, and Edmund}.>
1753  *<S {Glo}.> Alacke, alacke {Edmund}, I like not this vnnaturall
1754  *dealing; when I desired their leaue that I might pity him,
1755  *they tooke from me the vse of mine owne house, charg'd
1756  *me on paine of perpetuall displeasure, neither to speake
1757   of him, entreat for him, or any way sustaine him.
1758   <S {Bast}.> Most sauage and vnnaturall.
1759  *<S {Glo}.> Go #too; say you nothing. There is diuision be-tweene
1760  *the Dukes, and a worsse matter then that: I haue
1761  *receiued a Letter this night, 'tis dangerous to be spoken,
1762  *I haue lock'd the Letter in my Closset, these iniuries the
1763  *King now beares, will be reuenged home; ther is part of
1764  *a Power already footed, we must incline to the King, I
1765  *will looke him, and priuily relieue him; goe you and
1766  *maintaine talke with the Duke, that my charity be not of
1767  *him perceiued; If he aske for me, I am #ill, and gone to
1768  *bed, if I die for it, (as no lesse is threatned me) the King
1769  *my old Master must be relieued. There is strange things
1770   toward {Edmund}, pray you be carefull. <D {Exit}.>
1771   <S {Bast}.> This Curtesie forbid thee, shall the Duke
1772   Instantly know, and of that Letter too;
1773   This seemes a faire deseruing, and must draw me
1774   That which my Father looses: no lesse then all,
1775   The yonger rises, when the old doth fall. <D {Exit}.>
1776   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
1777   <D {Enter Lear, Kent, and Foole}.>
1778  *<S {Kent}.> Here is the place my Lord, good my Lord enter,
1779   The tirrany of the open night's too rough
1780   For Nature to endure.  <D {Storme still}>
1781   <S {Lear}.> Let me alone.
1782   <S {Kent}.> Good my Lord enter heere.
1783   <S {Lear}.> #Wilt breake my heart?
1784   <S {Kent}.> I had rather breake mine owne,
1785   Good my Lord enter.
1786   <S {Lear}.> Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious |(storme
1787   Inuades vs to the skin so: 'tis to thee,
1788   But where the greater malady is fixt,
1789   The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a Beare,
1790   But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,
1791   Thou'dst meete the Beare i'th' mouth, when the mind's |(free,
1792   The bodies delicate: the tempest in my mind,
1793   Doth from my sences take all feeling else,
1794   Saue what beates there, Filliall ingratitude,
1795   Is it not as this mouth should teare this hand
1796   For lifting food too't? But I will punish home;
1797   No, I will weepe no more; in such a night,
1798   To shut me out? Poure on, I will endure:
1799   In such a night as this? O {Regan, Gonerill},
1800   Your old kind Father,  whose franke heart gaue all,
1801   O that way madnesse lies, let me shun that:
1802   No more of that.
1803   <S {Kent}.> Good my Lord enter here.
1804   <S {Lear}.> Prythee go in thy selfe, seeke thine owne ease,
1805   This tempest will not giue me leaue to ponder
1806   On things would hurt me more, but Ile goe in,
1807   In Boy, go first. You houselesse pouertie,  <D {Exit}.>
1808   Nay get thee in; Ile pray, and then Ile sleepe.
1809   Poore naked wretches, where so ere you are
1810   That bide the pelting of this pittilesse storme,
1811   How shall your House- lesse heads, and vnfed sides,
1812   Your lop'd, and window'd raggednesse defend you
1813   From seasons such as these? O I haue tane
1814   Too little care of this: Take Physicke, Pompe,
1815   Expose thy selfe to feele what wretches feele,
1816   That thou maist shake the superflux to them,
1817   And shew the Heauens more iust.

1819  *<S {Edg}.> Fathom, and halfe, Fathom and halfe; poore {Tom}.

1821   me, helpe me.
1822   <S {Kent}.> Giue my thy hand, who's there?
1823  *<S {Foole}.> A spirite, a spirite, he sayes his name's poore
1824   {Tom}.
1825  *<S {Kent}.> What art thou that dost grumble there i'th'
1826   straw? Come forth.
1827  *<S {Edg}.> Away, the foule Fiend followes me, through the
1828  *sharpe Hauthorne blow the windes. Humh, goe to thy
1829   bed and warme thee.
1830  *<S {Lear}.> Did'st thou giue all to thy Daughters? And art
1831   thou come to this?
1832  *<S {Edgar}.> Who giues any thing to poore {Tom}? Whom
1833  *the foule fiend hath led through Fire, and through Flame,
1834  *through Sword, and Whirle- Poole, o're Bog, and Quag-mire,
1835  *that hath laid Kniues vnder his Pillow, and Halters
1836  *in his Pue, set Rats- bane by his Porredge, made him
1837  *Proud of heart, to ride on a Bay trotting Horse, ouer foure
1838  *incht Bridges, to course his owne shadow for a Traitor.
1839  *Blisse thy fiue Wits, {Tom}s #a cold. O #do, #de, #do, #de, #do, #de,

1845  *Could'st thou saue nothing? Would'st thou giue 'em all?
1846  *<S {Foole}.> Nay, he reseru'd a Blanket, else we had bin all
1847   sham'd.
1848  *<S {Lea}.> Now all the plagues that in the pendulous ayre
1849   Hang fated o're mens faults, light on thy Daughters.
1850   <S {Kent}.> He hath no Daughters Sir.
1851  *<S {Lear}.> Death Traitor, nothing could haue subdu'd |(Nature
1852   To such a lownesse, but his vnkind Daughters.
1853   Is it the fashion, that discarded Fathers,
1854   Should haue thus little mercy on their flesh:
1855   Iudicious punishment, 'twas this flesh begot
1856   Those Pelicane Daughters.
1857  *<S {Edg}.> Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill, alow: alow, loo, loo.
1858  *<S {Foole}.> This cold night will turne vs all to Fooles, and
1859   Madmen.
1860  *<S {Edgar}.> Take heed o'th' foule Fiend, obey thy Pa-rents,
1861  *keepe thy words Iustice, sweare not, commit not,
      <P rr3v><C B>
1862  *with mans sworne Spouse: set not thy Sweet- heart on
1863   proud array. {Tom}'s #a cold.
1864   <S {Lear}.> What hast thou bin?
1865  *<S {Edg}.> A Seruingman?  Proud in heart, and minde; that
1866  *curl'd my haire, wore Gloues in my cap; seru'd the Lust
1867  *of my Mistris heart, and did the acte of darkenesse with
1868  *her. Swore as many Oathes, as I spake words, & broke
1869  *them in the sweet face of Heauen. One, that slept in the
1870  *contriuing of Lust, and wak'd to doe it. Wine lou'd I
1871  *deerely, Dice deerely; and in Woman, out- Paramour'd
1872  *the Turke. False of heart, light of eare, bloody of hand;
1873  *Hog in sloth, Foxe in stealth, Wolfe in greedinesse, Dog
1874  *in madnes, Lyon in prey. Let not the creaking of shooes,
1875  *Nor the rustling of Silkes, betray thy poore heart to wo-man.
1876  *Keepe thy foote out of Brothels, thy hand out of
1877  *Plackets, thy pen from Lenders Bookes, and defye the
1878  *foule Fiend. Still through the Hauthorne blowes the

1880   Boy {Sesey}: let him trot by.  <D {Storme still}.>
1881  *<S {Lear}.> Thou wert better in a Graue, then to answere
1882  *with thy vncouer'd body, this extremitie of the Skies. Is
1883  *man no more then this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st
1884  *the Worme no Silke; the Beast, no Hide; the Sheepe, no
1885  *Wooll; the Cat, no perfume. Ha? Here's three on's are
1886  *sophisticated. Thou art the thing it selfe; vnaccommo-dated
1887  *man, is no more but such a poore, bare, forked A-nimall
1888  *as thou art. Off, off you Lendings: Come, vn-button
1889   heere.
1890   <D {Enter Gloucester, with a Torch}.>
1891  *<S {Foole}.> Prythee Nunckle be contented, 'tis a naughtie
1892  *night to swimme in. Now a little fire in a wilde Field,

1894   on's body, cold: Looke,   heere comes a walking fire.
1895  *<S {Edg}.> This is the foule Flibbertigibbet; hee begins at
1896  *Curfew, and walkes at first Cocke: Hee giues the Web
1897  *and the Pin, squints the eye, and makes the Hare- lippe;
1898  *Mildewes the white Wheate, and hurts the poore Crea-ture
1899   of earth.

1908  *<S {Edg}.> Poore Tom, that eates the swimming Frog, the

1910  *in the furie of his heart, when the foule Fiend rages, eats
1911  *Cow- dung for Sallets; swallowes the old Rat, and the
1912  *ditch- Dogge; drinkes the green Mantle of the standing
1913  *Poole: who is whipt from Tything to Tything, and
1914  *stockt, punish'd, and imprison'd: who hath three Suites
1915   to his backe, sixe shirts to his body:
1916   Horse to ride, and weapon to weare:
1917   But Mice, and Rats, and such small Deare,

1919  *Beware my Follower. Peace Smulkin, peace thou Fiend.
1920   <S {Glou}.> What, hath your Grace no better company?
1921  *<S {Edg}.> The Prince of Darkenesse is a Gentleman. {Modo}
1922   he's call'd, and {Mahu}.
1923  *<S {Glou}.> Our flesh and blood, my Lord, is growne so
1924   vilde, that it doth hate what gets it.
1925   <S {Edg}.> Poore Tom's #a cold.
1926   <S {Glou}.> Go in with me; my duty cannot suffer
1927   T' obey in all your daughters hard commands:
1928   Though their Iniunction be to barre my doores,
1929   And let this Tyrannous night take hold vpon you,
1930   Yet haue I ventured to come seeke you out,
1931   And bring you where both fire, and food is ready.
1932   <S {Lear}.> First let me talke with this Philosopher,
1933   What is the cause of Thunder?
1934   <S {Kent}.> Good my Lord take his offer,
1935   Go into th' house.
1936  *<S {Lear}.> Ile talke a word with this same lerned Theban:
1937   What is your study?
1938  *<S {Edg}.> How to preuent the Fiend, and to kill Vermine.
1939   <S {Lear}.> Let me aske you one word in priuate.
1940   <S {Kent}.> Importune him once more to go my Lord,

1942   <S {Glou}.> Canst thou blame him?  <D {Storm still}>
1943   His Daughters seeke his death: Ah, that good Kent,
1944   He said it would be thus: poore banish'd man:
1945   Thou sayest the King growes mad, Ile tell thee Friend
1946   I am almost mad my selfe. I had a Sonne,
1947   Now out- law'd from my blood: he sought my life
1948   But lately: very late: I lou'd him (Friend)
1949   No Father his Sonne deerer: true to tell thee,
1950   The greefe hath craz'd my wits. What a night's this?
1951   I do beseech your grace.
1952   <S {Lear}.> O cry you mercy, Sir:
1953   Noble Philosopher, your company.
1954   <S {Edg}.> Tom's #a cold.

1960   <S {Kent}.> Good my Lord, sooth him:
1961   Let him take the Fellow.
1962   <S {Glou}.> Take him you on.
1963   <S {Kent}.> Sirra, come on: go along with vs.
1964   <S {Lear}.> Come, good Athenian.
1965   <S {Glou}.> No words, no words, hush.
1966   <S {Edg}.> Childe {Rowland} to the darke Tower came,

1972  *<S {Bast}.> How my Lord, I may be censured, that Nature
1973  *thus giues way to Loyaltie, something feares mee to
1974   thinke of.
1975  *<S {Cornw}.> I now perceiue, it was not altogether your
1976  *Brothers euill disposition made him seeke his death: but
1977  *a prouoking merit set a- worke by a reprouable badnesse
1978   in himselfe.
1979  *<S {Bast}.> How malicious is my fortune, that I must re-pent
1980  *to be iust? This is the Letter which hee spoake of;
1981  *which approues him an intelligent partie to the aduanta-ges
1982  *of France. O Heauens! that this Treason were not;
1983   or not I the detector.
1984   <S {Corn}.> Go with me to the Dutchesse.
1985  *<S {Bast}.> If the matter of this Paper be certain, you haue
1986   mighty businesse in hand.
      <P rr4>
1987  *<S {Corn}.> True or false, it hath made thee Earle of Glou-cester:
1988  *seeke out where thy Father is, that hee may bee
1989   ready for our apprehension.
1990  *<S {Bast}.> If I finde him comforting the King, it will stuffe
1991  *his suspition more fully. I will perseuer in my course of
1992  *Loyalty, though the conflict be sore betweene that, and
1993   my blood.
1994  *<S {Corn}.> I will lay trust vpon thee: and thou shalt finde

2007  *<S {Foole}.> Prythee Nunkle tell me, whether a madman be
2008   a Gentleman, or a Yeoman.
2009   <S {Lear}.> A King, a King.
2010  *<S {Foole}.> No, he's a Yeoman, that ha's a Gentleman to
2011  *his Sonne: for hee's a mad Yeoman that sees his Sonne a
2012   Gentleman before him.
2013   <S {Lear}.> To haue a thousand with red burning spits
2014   Come hizzing in vpon 'em.
2015   <S {Edg}.> Blesse thy fiue wits.
2016   <S {Kent}.> O pitty: Sir, where is the patience now
2017   That you so oft haue boasted to retaine?
2018   <S {Edg}.> My teares begin to take his part so much,
2019   They marre my counterfetting.
2020   <S {Lear}.> The little dogges, and all;
2021   Trey, Blanch, and Sweet- heart: see, they barke at me.
2022  *<S {Edg}.> Tom, will throw his head at them: Auaunt you
2023   Curres, be thy mouth or blacke or white:
2024   Tooth that poysons if it bite:
2025   Mastiffe, Grey- hound, Mongrill, Grim,
2026   Hound or Spaniell, Brache, or Hym:
2027   Or Bobtaile tight, or Troudle taile,
2028   Tom will make him weepe and waile,

2030   Dogs leapt the hatch, and all are fled.
2031  *#Do, #de, #de, #de: sese: Come, march to Wakes and Fayres,
2032   And Market Townes: poore Tom thy horne is dry,
2033  *<S {Lear}.> Then let them Anatomize {Regan}: See what

2037  *You will say they are Persian; but let them bee

2040  *<S {Kent}.> Now good my Lord, lye heere, and rest awhile.
2041  *<S {Lear}.> Make no noise, make no noise, draw the Cur-taines:
2042   so, so, wee'l go to Supper i'th' morning.
2043   <S {Foole}.> And Ile go to bed at noone.
2044   <S {Glou}.> Come hither Friend:

2049   There is a Litter ready, lay him in't,
2050  *And driue toward Douer friend, where thou shalt meete
2051   Both welcome, and protection. Take vp thy Master,
2052   If thou should'st dally halfe an houre, his life

2054   Stand in assured losse. Take vp, take vp,

2062   the Traitor Glouster.
2063   <S {Reg}.> Hang him instantly.
2064   <S {Gon}.> Plucke out his eyes.
2065  *<S {Corn}.> Leaue him to my displeasure. {Edmond}, keepe
2066  *you our Sister company: the reuenges wee are bound to
2067  *take vppon your Traitorous Father, are not fit for your
2068  *beholding. Aduice the Duke where you are going, to a

2071   deere Sister, farewell my Lord of Glouster.
2072   <D {Enter Steward}.>
2073   How now? Where's the King?
2074  *<S {Stew}.> My Lord of Glouster hath conuey'd him hence
2075   Some fiue or six and thirty of his Knights
2076   Hot Questrists after him, met him at gate,
2077   Who, with some other of the Lords, dependants,
2078   Are gone with him toward Douer; where they boast
2079   To haue well armed Friends.
2080   <S {Corn}.> Get horses for your Mistris.
2081   <S {Gon}.> Farewell sweet Lord, and Sister.  <D {Exit}>
2082  *<S {Corn}.> {Edmund} farewell: go seek the Traitor Gloster,
2083   Pinnion him like a Theefe, bring him before vs:
2084   Though well we may not passe vpon his life
2085   Without the forme of Iustice: yet our power
2086   Shall do a curt'sie to our wrath, which men
2087   May blame, but not comptroll.
2088   <D {Enter Gloucester, and Seruants}.>
2089   Who's there? the Traitor?
2090   <S {Reg}.> Ingratefull Fox, 'tis he.
2091   <S {Corn}.> Binde fast his corky armes.
2092   <S {Glou}.> What meanes your Graces?
2093   Good my Friends consider you are my Ghests:
2094   Do me no foule play, Friends.
2095   <S {Corn}.> Binde him I say.
2096   <S {Reg}.> Hard, hard: O filthy Traitor.
2097   <S {Glou}.> Vnmercifull Lady, as you are, I'me none.
2098   <S {Corn}.> To this Chaire binde him,
2099   Villaine, thou shalt finde.
2100   <S {Glou}.> By the kinde Gods, 'tis most ignobly done
2101   To plucke me by the Beard.
2102   <S {Reg}.> So white, and such a Traitor?
2103   <S {Glou}.> Naughty Ladie,
2104   These haires which thou dost rauish from my chin
2105   Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your Host,
2106   With Robbers hands, my hospitable fauours
      <P rr4v>
2107   You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
2108   <S {Corn}.> Come Sir.
2109   What Letters had you late from France?
2110   <S {Reg}.> Be simple answer'd, for we know the truth.
2111  *<S {Corn}.> And what confederacie haue you with the Trai-tors,
2112   late footed in the Kingdome?
2113   <S {Reg}.> To whose hands
2114   You haue sent the Lunaticke King: Speake.
2115   <S {Glou}.> I haue a Letter guessingly set downe
2116   Which came from one that's of a newtrall heart,
2117   And not from one oppos'd.
2118   <S {Corn}.> Cunning.
2119   <S {Reg}.> And false.
2120   <S {Corn}.> Where hast thou sent the King?
2121   <S {Glou}.> To Douer.
2122   <S {Reg}.> Wherefore to Douer?
2123   Was't thou not charg'd at perill.
2124   <S {Corn}.> Wherefore to Douer? Let him answer that.
2125   <S {Glou}.> I am tyed to'th' Stake,
2126   And I must stand the Course.
2127   <S {Reg}.> Wherefore to Douer?
2128   <S {Glou}.> Because I would not see thy cruell Nailes
2129   Plucke out his poore old eyes: nor thy fierce Sister,
2130   In his Annointed flesh, sticke boarish phangs.
2131   The Sea, with such a storme as his bare head,
2132   In Hell- blacke- night indur'd, would haue buoy'd vp
2133   And quench'd the Stelled fires:
2134   Yet poore old heart, he holpe the Heauens to raine.
2135   If Wolues had at thy Gate howl'd that sterne time,
2136   Thou should'st haue said, good Porter turne the Key:
2137   All Cruels else subscribe: but I shall see
2138   The winged Vengeance ouertake such Children.
2139  *<S {Corn}.> See't shalt thou neuer. Fellowes hold y Chaire,
2140   Vpon these eyes of thine, Ile set my foote.
2141   <S {Glou}.> He that will thinke to liue, till he be old,
2142   Giue me some helpe. === O cruell! O you Gods.
2143   <S {Reg}.> One side will mocke another: Th' other too.
2144   <S {Corn}.> If you see vengeance.
2145   <S {Seru}.> Hold your hand, my Lord:
2146   I haue seru'd you euer since I was a Childe:
2147   But better seruice haue I neuer done you,
2148   Then now to bid you hold.
2149   <S {Reg}.> How now, you dogge?
2150   <S {Ser}.> If you did weare a beard vpon your chin,
2151   I'ld shake it on this quarrell. What do you meane?
2152   <S {Corn}.> My Villaine?
2153  *<S {Seru}.> Nay then come on, and take the chance of anger.
2154   <S {Reg}.> Giue me thy Sword. #A pezant stand vp thus?
2155   <D {Killes him}.>
2156  *<S {Ser}.> Oh I am slaine: my Lord, you haue one eye left
2157   To see some mischefe on him. Oh.
2158   <S {Corn}.> Lest it see more, preuent it; Out vilde gelly:
2159   Where is thy luster now?
2160   <S {Glou}.> All darke and comfortlesse?
2161   Where's my Sonne {Edmund}?
2162   {Edmund}, enkindle all the sparkes of Nature
2163   To quit this horrid acte.
2164   <S {Reg}.> Out treacherous Villaine,
2165   Thou call'st on him, that hates thee. It was he
2166   That made the ouerture of thy Treasons to vs:
2167   Who is too good to pitty thee.
2168   <S {Glou}.> O my Follies! then {Edgar} was abus'd,
2169   Kinde Gods, forgiue me that, and prosper him.
2170   <S {Reg}.> Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
2171   His way to Douer.  <D {Exit with Glouster}.>
2172   How is't my Lord? How looke you?
2173   <S {Corn}.> I haue receiu'd a hurt: Follow me Lady;
2174   Turne out that eyelesse Villaine: throw this Slaue
2175   Vpon the Dunghill: {Regan}, I bleed apace,
2176  *Vntimely comes this hurt. Giue me your arme.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2177   <Z {Actus Quartus. Scena Prima}.>
2178   <D {Enter Edgar}.>
2179   <S {Edg}.> Yet better thus, and knowne to be contemn'd,
2180   Then still contemn'd and flatter'd, to be worst:
2181   The lowest, and most deiected thing of Fortune,
2182   Stands still in esperance, liues not in feare:
2183   The lamentable change is from the best,
2184   The worst returnes to laughter. Welcome then,
2185   Thou vnsubstantiall ayre that I embrace:
2186   The Wretch that thou hast blowne vnto the worst,
2187   Owes nothing to thy blasts.
2188   <D {Enter Glouster, and an Oldman}.>
2189   But who comes heere? My Father poorely led?
2190   World, World, O world!
2191   But that thy strange mutations make vs hate thee,
2192   Life would not yeelde to age.
2193   <S {Oldm}.> O my good Lord, I haue bene your Tenant,
2194   And your Fathers Tenant, these fourescore yeares.
2195   <S {Glou}.> Away, get thee away: good Friend be gone,
2196   Thy comforts can do me no good at all,
2197   Thee, they may hurt.
2198   <S {Oldm}.> You cannot see your way.
2199   <S {Glou}.> I haue no way, and therefore want no eyes:
2200   I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seene,
2201   Our meanes secure vs, and our meere defects
2202   Proue our Commodities. Oh deere Sonne {Edgar},
2203   The food of thy abused Fathers wrath:
2204   Might I but liue to see thee in my touch,
2205   I'ld say I had eyes againe.
2206   <S {Oldm}.> How now? who's there?
2207   <S {Edg}.> O Gods! Who is't can say I am at the worst?
2208   I am worse then ere I was.
2209   <S {Old}.> 'Tis poore mad Tom.
2210   <S {Edg}.> And worse I may be yet: the worst is not,
2211   So long as we can say this is the worst.
2212   <S {Oldm}.> Fellow, where goest?
2213   <S {Glou}.> Is it a Beggar- man?
2214   <S {Oldm}.> Madman, and beggar too.
2215   <S {Glou}.> He has some reason, else he could not beg.
2216   I'th' last nights storme, I such a fellow saw;
2217   Which made me thinke a Man, a Worme. My Sonne
2218   Came then into my minde, and yet my minde
2219   Was then scarse Friends with him.
2220   I haue heard more since:
2221   As Flies to wanton Boyes, are we to th' Gods,
2222   They kill vs for their sport.
2223   <S {Edg}.> How should this be?
2224   Bad is the Trade that must play Foole to sorrow,
2225   Ang'ring it selfe, and others. Blesse thee Master.
2226   <S {Glou}.> Is that the naked Fellow?
2227   <S {Oldm}.> #I, my Lord.
2228   <S {Glou}.> Get thee away: If for my sake
2229   Thou wilt ore- take vs hence a mile or twaine
2230   I'th' way toward Douer, do it for ancient loue,
2231   And bring some couering for this naked Soule,
2232   Which Ile intreate to leade me.
2233   <S {Old}.> Alacke sir, he is mad.
      <P rr5>
2234   <S {Glou}.> 'Tis the times plague,
2235   When Madmen leade the blinde:
2236   Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure:
2237   Aboue the rest, be gone.
2238   <S {Oldm}.> Ile bring him the best Parrell that I haue
2239   Come on't what will.  <D {Exit}>
2240   <S {Glou}.> Sirrah, naked fellow.
2241   <S {Edg}.> Poore Tom's #a cold. I cannot daub it further.
2242   <S {Glou}.> Come hither fellow.
2243   <S {Edg}.> And yet I must:
2244   Blesse thy sweete eyes, they bleede.
2245   <S {Glou}.> Know'st thou the way to Douer?
2246  *<S {Edg}.> Both style, and gate; Horseway, and foot- path:
2247  *poore Tom hath bin scarr'd out of his good wits. Blesse
2248   thee good mans sonne, from the foule Fiend.
2249  *<S {Glou}.> Here take this purse, y whom the heau'ns plagues
2250   Haue humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
2251   Makes thee the happier: Heauens deale so still:
2252   Let the superfluous, and Lust- dieted man,
2253   That slaues your ordinance, that will not see
2254   Because he do's not feele, feele your powre quickly:
2255   So distribution should vndoo excesse,
2256   And each man haue enough. Dost thou know Douer?
2257   <S {Edg}.> #I Master.
2258  *<S {Glou}.> There is a Cliffe, whose high and bending head
2259   Lookes fearfully in the confined Deepe:
2260   Bring me but to the very brimme of it,
2261   And Ile repayre the misery thou do'st beare
2262   With something rich about me: from that place,
2263   I shall no leading neede.
2264   <S {Edg}.> Giue me thy arme;
2265   Poore Tom shall leade thee.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2266   <Z {Scena Secunda}.>
2267   <D {Enter Gonerill, Bastard, and Steward}.>
2268  *<S {Gon}.> Welcome my Lord. I meruell our mild husband
2269   Not met vs on the way. Now, where's your Master?
2270   <S {Stew}.> Madam within, but neuer man so chang'd:
2271   I told him of the Army that was Landed:
2272   He smil'd at it. I told him you were comming,
2273   His answer was, the worse. Of Glosters Treachery,
2274   And of the loyall Seruice of his Sonne
2275   When I inform'd him, then he call'd me Sot,
2276   And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
2277   What most he should dislike, seemes pleasant to him;
2278   What like, offensiue.
2279   <S {Gon}.> Then shall you go no further.
2280   It is the Cowish terror of his spirit
2281   That dares not vndertake: Hee'l not feele wrongs
2282   Which tye him to an answer: our wishes on the way
2283   May proue effects. Backe {Edmond} to my Brother,
2284   Hasten his Musters, and conduct his powres.
2285   I must change names at home, and giue the Distaffe
2286   Into my Husbands hands. This trustie Seruant
2287   Shall passe betweene vs: ere long you are like to heare
2288   (If you dare venture in your owne behalfe)
2289   A Mistresses command. Weare this; spare speech,
2290   Decline your head. This kisse, if it durst speake
2291   Would stretch thy Spirits vp into the ayre:
2292   Conceiue, and fare thee well.
2293   <S {Bast}.> Yours in the rankes of death.  <D {Exit}.>
2294   <S {Gon}.> My most deere Gloster.
2295   Oh, the difference of man, and man,
2296   To thee a Womans seruices are due,
2297   My Foole vsurpes my body.
2298   <S {Stew}.> Madam, here come's my Lord.
2299   <D {Enter Albany}.>
2300   <S {Gon}.> I haue beene worth the whistle.
2301   <S {Alb}.> Oh {Gonerill},
2302   You are not worth the dust which the rude winde
2303   Blowes in your face.
2304   <S {Gon}.> Milke- Liuer'd man,
2305   That bear'st a cheeke for blowes, a head for wrongs,
2306   Who hast not in thy browes an eye- discerning
2307   Thine Honor, from thy suffering.
2308   <S {Alb}.> See thy selfe diuell:
2309   Proper deformitie seemes not in the Fiend
2310   So horrid as in woman.
2311   <S {Gon}.> Oh vaine Foole.
2312   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
2313  *<S {Mes}.> Oh my good  Lord, the Duke of {Cornwal}s dead,
2314   Slaine by his Seruant, going to put out
2315   The other eye of Glouster.
2316   <S {Alb}.> Glousters eyes.
2317   <S {Mes}.> A Seruant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
2318   Oppos'd against the act: bending his Sword
2319   To his great Master, who, threat- enrag'd
2320   Flew on him, and among'st them fell'd him dead,
2321   But not without that harmefull stroke, which since
2322   Hath pluckt him after.
2323   <S {Alb}.> This shewes you are aboue
2324   You Iustices, that these our neather crimes
2325   So speedily can venge. But (O poore Glouster)
2326   Lost he his other eye?
2327   <S {Mes}.> Both, both, my Lord.
2328   This Leter Madam, craues a speedy answer:
2329   'Tis from your Sister.
2330   <S {Gon}.> One way I like this well.
2331   But being widdow, and my Glouster with her,
2332   May all the building in my fancie plucke
2333   Vpon my hatefull life. Another way
2334   The Newes is not so tart. Ile read, and answer.
2335   <S {Alb}.> Where was his Sonne,
2336   When they did take his eyes?
2337   <S {Mes}.> Come with my Lady hither.
2338   <S {Alb}.> He is not heere.
2339   <S {Mes}.> No my good Lord, I met him backe againe.
2340   <S {Alb}.> Knowes he the wickednesse?
2341  *<S {Mes}.> #I my good Lord: 'twas he inform'd against him
2342   And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
2343   Might haue the freer course.
2344   <S {Alb}.> Glouster, I liue
2345   To thanke thee for the loue thou shew'dst the King,
2346   And to reuenge thine eyes. Come hither Friend,
2347   Tell me what more thou know'st.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2348   <Z {Scena Tertia}.>
2349   <D {Enter with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Gentlemen},
2350   {and Souldiours}.>
2351   <S {Cor}.> Alacke, 'tis he: why he was met euen now
2352   As mad as the vext Sea, singing alowd.
2353   Crown'd with ranke Fenitar, and furrow weeds,
2354  *With Hardokes, Hemlocke, Nettles, Cuckoo flowres,
      <P rr5v>
2355   Darnell, and all the idle weedes that grow
2356   In our sustaining Corne. A Centery send forth;
2357   Search euery Acre in the high- growne field,
2358   And bring him to our eye. What can mans wisedome
2359   In the restoring his bereaued Sense; he that helpes him,
2360   Take all my outward worth.
2361   <S {Gent}.> There is meanes Madam:
2362   Our foster Nurse of Nature, is repose,
2363   The which he lackes: that to prouoke in him
2364   Are many Simples operatiue, whose power
2365   Will close the eye of Anguish.
2366   <S {Cord}.> All blest Secrets,
2367   All you vnpublish'd Vertues of the earth
2368   Spring with my teares; be aydant, and remediate
2369   In the Goodmans desires: seeke, seeke for him,
2370   Least his vngouern'd rage, dissolue the life
2371   That wants the meanes to leade it.
2372   <D {Enter Messenger}.>
2373   <S {Mes}.> Newes Madam,
2374   The Brittish Powres are marching hitherward.
2375   <S {Cor}.> 'Tis knowne before. Our preparation stands
2376   In expectation of them. O deere Father,
2377  *It is thy businesse that I go about: Therfore great France
2378   My mourning, and importun'd teares hath pittied:
2379   No blowne Ambition doth our Armes incite,
2380   But loue, deere loue, and our ag'd Fathers Rite:
2381   Soone may I heare, and see him.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2382   <Z {Scena Quarta}.>
2383   <D {Enter Regan, and Steward}.>
2384   <S {Reg}.> But are my Brothers Powres set forth?
2385   <S {Stew}.> #I Madam.
2386   <S {Reg}.> Himselfe in person there?
2387   <S {Stew}.> Madam with much ado:
2388   Your Sister is the better Souldier.
2389  *<S {Reg}.> Lord {Edmund} spake not with your Lord at home?
2390   <S {Stew}.> No Madam.
2391   <S {Reg}.> What might import my Sisters Letter to him?
2392   <S {Stew}.> I know not, Lady.
2393   <S {Reg}.> Faith he is poasted hence on serious matter:
2394   It was great ignorance, Glousters eyes being out
2395   To let him liue. Where he arriues, he moues
2396   All hearts against vs: {Edmund}, I thinke is gone
2397   In pitty of his misery, to dispatch
2398   His nighted life: Moreouer to descry
2399   The strength o'th' Enemy.
2400  *<S {Stew}.> I must needs after him, Madam, with my Letter.
2401   <S {Reg}.> Our troopes set forth to morrow, stay with vs:
2402   The wayes are dangerous.
2403   <S {Stew}.> I may not Madam:
2404   My Lady charg'd my dutie in this busines.
2405   <S {Reg}.> Why should she write to {Edmund}?
2406  *Might not you transport her purposes by word? Belike,
2407   Some things, I know not what. Ile loue thee much
2408   Let me vnseale the Letter.
2409   <S {Stew}.> Madam, I had rather===
2410   <S {Reg}.> I know your Lady do's not loue her Husband,
2411   I am sure of that: and at her late being heere,
2412   She gaue strange Eliads, and most speaking lookes
2413   To Noble {Edmund}. I know you are of her bosome.
2414   <S {Stew}.> I, Madam?
2415   <S {Reg}.> I speake in vnderstanding:  Y'are: I know't,
2416   Therefore I do aduise you take this note:
2417   My Lord is dead: {Edmond}, and I haue talk'd,
2418   And more conuenient is he for my hand
2419   Then for your Ladies: You may gather more:
2420   If you do finde him, pray you giue him this;
2421   And when your Mistris heares thus much from you,
2422   I pray desire her call her wisedome to her.
2423   So fare you well:
2424   If you do chance to heare of that blinde Traitor,
2425   Preferment fals on him, that cuts him off.
2426   <S {Stew}.> Would I could meet Madam, I should shew
2427   What party I do follow.
2428   <S {Reg}.> Fare thee well.  <D {Exeunt}>
2429   <Z {Scena Quinta}.>
2430   <D {Enter Gloucester, and Edgar}.>
2431   <S {Glou}.> When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?
2432  *<S {Edg}.> You do climbe vp it now. Look how we labor.
2433   <S {Glou}.> Me thinkes the ground is eeuen.
2434   <S {Edg}.> Horrible steepe.
2435   Hearke, do you heare the Sea?
2436   <S {Glou}.> No truly.
2437   <S {Edg}.> Why then your other Senses grow imperfect
2438   By your eyes anguish.
2439   <S {Glou}.> So may it be indeed.
2440   Me thinkes thy voyce is alter'd, and thou speak'st
2441   In better phrase, and matter then thou did'st.
2442   <S {Edg}.> Y'are much deceiu'd: In nothing am I chang'd
2443   But in my Garments.
2444   <S {Glou}.> Me thinkes y'are better spoken.
2445   <S {Edg}.> Come on Sir,
2446   Heere's the place: stand still: how fearefull
2447   And dizie 'tis, to cast ones eyes so low,
2448  *The Crowes and Choughes, that wing the midway ayre
2449   Shew scarse so grosse as Beetles. Halfe way downe
2450   Hangs one that gathers Sampire: dreadfull Trade:
2451   Me thinkes he seemes no bigger then his head.
2452   The Fishermen, that walk'd vpon the beach
2453   Appeare like Mice: and yond tall Anchoring Barke,
2454   Diminish'd to her Cocke: her Cocke, a Buoy
2455   Almost too small for sight. The murmuring Surge,
2456   That on th' vnnumbred idle Pebble chafes
2457   Cannot be heard so high. Ile looke no more,
2458   Least my braine turne, and the deficient sight
2459   Topple downe headlong.
2460   <S {Glou}.> Set me where you stand.
2461   <S {Edg}.> Giue me your hand:
2462   You are now within a foote of th' extreme Verge:
2463   For all beneath the Moone would I not leape vpright.
2464   <S {Glou}.> Let go my hand:
2465   Heere Friend's another purse: in it, a Iewell
2466   Well worth a poore mans taking. Fayries, and Gods
2467   Prosper it with thee. Go thou further off,
2468   Bid me farewell, and let me heare thee going.
2469   <S {Edg}.> Now fare ye well, good Sir.
2470   <S {Glou}.> With all my heart.
2471   <S {Edg}.> Why I do trifle thus with his dispaire,
2472   Is done to cure it.
2473   <S {Glou}.> O you mighty Gods!
2474   This world I do renounce, and in your sights
      <P rr6>
2475   Shake patiently my great affliction off:
2476   If I could beare it longer, and not fall
2477   To quarrell with your great opposelesse willes,
2478   My snuffe, and loathed part of Nature should
2479   Burne it selfe out. If {Edgar} liue, O blesse him:
2480   Now Fellow, fare thee well.
2481   <S {Edg}.> Gone Sir, farewell:
2482   And yet I know not how conceit may rob
2483   The Treasury of life, when life it selfe
2484   Yeelds to the Theft. Had he bin where he thought,
2485   By this had thought bin past. Aliue, or dead?
2486   Hoa, you Sir: Friend, heare you Sir, speake:
2487   Thus might he passe indeed: yet he reuiues.
2488   What are you Sir?
2489   <S {Glou}.> Away, and let me dye.
2490   <S {Edg}.> Had'st thou beene ought
2491   But Gozemore, Feathers, Ayre,
2492   (So many fathome downe precipitating)
2493   Thou'dst shiuer'd like an Egge: but thou do'st breath:
2494   Hast heauy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound,
2495   Ten Masts at each, make not the altitude
2496   Which thou hast perpendicularly fell,
2497   Thy life's a Myracle. Speake yet againe.
2498   <S {Glou}.> But haue I falne, or no?
2499  *<S {Edg}.> From the dread Somnet of this Chalkie Bourne
2500   Looke vp a height, the shrill- gorg'd Larke so farre
2501   Cannot be seene, or heard: Do but looke vp.
2502   <S {Glou}.> Alacke, I haue no eyes:
2503   Is wretchednesse depriu'd that benefit
2504   To end it selfe by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
2505   When misery could beguile the Tyrants rage,
2506   And frustrate his proud #will.
2507   <S {Edg}.> Giue me your arme.
2508   Vp, so: How is't? Feele you your Legges? You stand.
2509   <S {Glou}.> Too well, too well.
2510   <S {Edg}.> This is aboue all strangenesse,
2511   Vpon the crowne o'th' Cliffe. What thing was that
2512   Which parted from you?
2513   <S {Glou}.> A poore vnfortunate Beggar.
2514   <S {Edg}.> As I stood heere below, me thought his eyes
2515   Were two full Moones: he had a thousand Noses,
2516   Hornes wealk'd, and waued like the enraged Sea:
2517   It was some Fiend: Therefore thou happy Father,
2518  *Thinke that the cleerest Gods, who make them Honors
2519   Of mens Impossibilities, haue preserued thee.
2520   <S {Glou}.> I do remember now: henceforth Ile beare
2521   Affliction, till it do cry out it selfe
2522   Enough, enough, and dye. That thing you speake of,
2523   I tooke it for a man: often 'twould say
2524   The Fiend, the Fiend, he led me to that place.
2525   <S {Edgar}.> Beare free and patient thoughts.
2526   <D {Enter Lear}.>
2527   But who comes heere?
2528   The safer sense will ne're accommodate
2529   His Master thus.
2530  *<S {Lear}.> No, they cannot touch me for crying. I am the
2531   King himselfe.
2532   <S {Edg}.> O thou side- piercing sight!
2533  *<S {Lear}.> Nature's aboue #Art, in that respect. Ther's your
2534  *Presse- money. That fellow handles his bow, like a Crow-keeper:
2535  *draw mee a Cloathiers yard. Looke, looke, a
2536  *Mouse: peace, peace, this peece of toasted Cheese will
2537  *doo't. There's my Gauntlet, Ile proue it on a Gyant.
2538  *Bring vp the browne Billes. O well flowne Bird: i'th'
2539   clout, i'th' clout: Hewgh. Giue the word.
2540   <S {Edg}.> Sweet Mariorum.
2541   <S {Lear}.> Passe.
2542   <S {Glou}.> I know that voice.
2543  *<S {Lear}.> Ha! {Gonerill} with a white beard? They flatter'd
2544  *me like a Dogge, and told mee I had the white hayres in
2545  *my Beard, ere the blacke ones were there. To say #I, and
2546  *no, to euery thing that I said: #I, and no too, was no good
2547  *Diuinity. When the raine came to wet me once, and the
2548  *winde to make me chatter: when the Thunder would not
2549  *peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em
2550  *out. Go #too, they are not men o'their words; they told
2551  *me, I was euery thing: 'Tis a Lye, I am not Agu- proofe.
2552  *<S {Glou}.> The tricke of that voyce, I do well remember:
2553   Is't not the King?
2554   <S {Lear}.> #I, euery inch a King.
2555   When I do stare, see how the Subiect quakes.
2556   I pardon that mans life. What was thy cause?
2557   Adultery? thou shalt not dye: dye for Adultery?
2558   No, the Wren goes too't, and the small gilded Fly
2559   Do's letcher in my sight. Let Copulation thriue:
2560   For Glousters bastard Son was kinder to his Father,
2561   Then my Daughters got 'tweene the lawfull sheets.
2562   Too't Luxury pell- mell, for I lacke Souldiers.
2563  *Behold yond simpring Dame, whose face betweene her
2564  *Forkes presages Snow; that minces Vertue, & do's shake
2565  *the head to heare of pleasures name. The Fitchew, nor
2566  *the soyled Horse goes too't with a more riotous appe-tite:
2567  *Downe from the waste they are Centaures, though
2568  *Women all aboue: but to the Girdle do the Gods inhe-rit,
2569  *beneath is all the Fiends. There's #hell, there's darke-nes,
2570  *there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench,
2571  *consumption: Fye, fie, fie; pah, pah: Giue me an Ounce
2572  *of Ciuet; good Apothecary sweeten my immagination:
2573   There's money for thee.
2574   <S {Glou}.> O let me kisse that hand.
2575   <S {Lear}.> Let me wipe it first,
2576   It smelles of Mortality.
2577   <S {Glou}.> O ruin'd peece of Nature, this great world
2578   Shall so weare out to naught.
2579   Do'st thou know me?
2580  *<S {Lear}.> I remember thine eyes well enough: dost thou
2581  *squiny at me? No, doe thy worst blinde Cupid, Ile not
2582  *loue. Reade thou this challenge, marke but the penning
2583   of it.
2584   <S {Glou}.> Were all thy Letters Sunnes, I could not see.
2585   <S {Edg}.> I would not take this from report,
2586   It is, and my heart breakes at it.
2587   <S {Lear}.> Read.
2588   <S {Glou}.> What with the Case of eyes?
2589  *<S {Lear}.> Oh ho, are you there with me? No eies in your
2590  *head, nor no mony in your purse? Your eyes are in a hea-uy
2591  *case, your purse in a light, yet you see how this world
2592   goes.
2593   <S {Glou}.> I see it feelingly.
2594  *<S {Lear}.> What, #art mad? A man may see how this world
2595  *goes, with no eyes. Looke with thine eares: See how
2596  *yond Iustice railes vpon yond simple theefe. Hearke in
2597  *thine eare: Change places, and handy- dandy, which is
2598  *the Iustice, which is the theefe: Thou hast seene a Far-mers
2599   dogge barke at a Beggar?
2600   <S {Glou}.> #I Sir.
2601  *<S {Lear}.> And the Creature run from the Cur: there thou
2602  *might'st behold the great image of Authoritie, a Dogg's

2605  *backe, thou hotly lusts to vse her in that kind, for which
2606  *thou whip'st her. The Vsurer hangs the Cozener. Tho-rough

2615   Bootes: harder, harder, so.
2616   <S {Edg}.> O matter, and impertinency mixt,
2617   Reason in Madnesse.
2618  *<S {Lear}.> If thou wilt weepe my Fortunes, take my eyes.
2619   I know thee well enough, thy name is Glouster:
2620   Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:

2622   We wawle, and cry. I will preach to thee: Marke.
2623   <S {Glou}.> Alacke, alacke the day.
2624   <S {Lear}.> When we are borne, we cry that we are come
2625   To this great stage of Fooles. #This a good blocke:
2626   It were a delicate stratagem to shoo
2627   A Troope of Horse with Felt: Ile put't in proofe,
2628   And when I haue stolne vpon these Son in Lawes,
2629   Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

2642   Come, come, I am a King, Masters, know you that?

2648   Who redeemes Nature from the generall curse
2649   Which twaine haue brought her to.

2656   How neere's the other Army?
2657   <S {Gent}.> Neere, and on speedy foot: the maine descry
2658   Stands on the hourely thought.
2659   <S {Edg}.> I thanke you Sir, that's all.

2676   <S {Stew}.> A proclaim'd prize: most happie
2677   That eyelesse head of thine, was first fram'd flesh
2678   To raise my fortunes. Thou old, vnhappy Traitor,
2679   Breefely thy selfe remember: the Sword is out
2680   That must destroy thee.
2681   <S {Glou}.> Now let thy friendly hand
2682   Put strength enough too't.
2683   <S {Stew}.> Wherefore, bold Pezant,

2730   Of the death- practis'd Duke: for him 'tis well,
2731   That of thy death, and businesse, I can tell.
2732   <S {Glou}.> The King is mad:
2733   How stiffe is my vilde sense
2734   That I stand vp, and haue ingenious feeling
2735   Of my huge Sorrowes? Better I were distract,
2736   So should my thoughts be seuer'd from my greefes,

2746   How shall I liue and worke
2747   To match thy goodnesse?
2748   My life will be too short,
2749   And euery measure faile me.
2750   <S {Kent}.> To be acknowledg'd Madam is ore- pai'd,
2751   All my reports go with the modest truth,
2752   Nor more, nor clipt, but so.
2753   <S {Cor}.> Be better suited,
2754   These weedes are memories of those worser houres:
2755   I prythee put them off.
2756   <S {Kent}.> Pardon deere Madam,
2757   Yet to be knowne shortens my made intent,
2758   My boone I make it, that you know me not,
2759   Till time, and I, thinke meet.
2760   <S {Cor}.> Then be't so my good Lord:
2761   How do's the King?
2762   <S {Gent}.> Madam sleepes still.
2763   <S {Cor}.> O you kind Gods!
2764   Cure this great breach in his abused Nature,
2765   Th' vntun'd and iarring senses, O winde vp,
2766   Of this childe- changed Father.
2767   <S {Gent}.> So please your Maiesty,
2768   That we may wake the King, he hath slept long?
2769   <S {Cor}.> Be gouern'd by your knowledge, and proceede
2770   I'th' sway of your owne #will: is he array'd?
2771   <D {Enter Lear in a chaire carried by Seruants}>
2772   <S {Gent}.> #I Madam: in the heauinesse of sleepe,
2773   We put fresh garments on him.
2774   Be by good Madam when we do awake him,
2775   I doubt of his Temperance.
2776   <S {Cor}.> O my deere Father, restauratian hang
2777   Thy medicine on my lippes, and let this kisse
2778   Repaire those violent harmes, that my two Sisters
2779   Haue in thy Reuerence made.
2780   <S {Kent}.> Kind and deere Princesse.
2781  *<S {Cor}.> Had you not bin their Father, these white flakes
2782   Did challenge pitty of them. Was this a face
2783   To be oppos'd against the iarring windes?
2784   Mine Enemies dogge, though he had bit me,
2785   Should haue stood that night against my fire,
2786   And was't thou faine (poore Father)
2787   To houell thee with Swine and Rogues forlorne,
2788   In short, and musty straw? Alacke, alacke,
2789   'Tis wonder that thy life and wits, at once
2790   Had not concluded all. He wakes, speake to him.
2791   <S {Gen}.> Madam do you, 'tis fittest.
2792   <S {Cor}.> How does my Royall Lord?
2793   How fares your Maiesty?
2794   <S {Lear}.> You do me wrong to take me out o'th' graue,
2795   Thou art a Soule in blisse, but I am bound
2796   Vpon a wheele of fire, that mine owne teares
2797   Do scal'd, like molten Lead.
2798   <S {Cor}.> Sir, do you know me?
2799   <S {Lear}.> You are a spirit I know, where did you dye?
2800   <S {Cor}.> Still, still, farre wide.
2801   <S {Gen}.> He's scarse awake,
2802   Let him alone #a while.
2803   <S {Lear}.> Where haue I bin?
2804   Where am I? Faire day light?
2805   I am mightily abus'd; I should eu'n dye with pitty
2806   To see another thus. I know not what to say:
2807   I will not sweare these are my hands: let's see,
2808   I feele this pin pricke, would I were assur'd
2809   Of my condition.
2810   <S {Cor}.> O looke vpon me Sir,
2811   And hold your hand in benediction o're me,
2812   You must not kneele.
2813   <S {Lear}.> Pray do not mocke me:
2814   I am a very foolish fond old man,
2815   Fourescore and vpward,
2816   Not an houre more, nor lesse:
2817   And to deale plainely,
2818   I feare I am not in my perfect mind.
2819   Me thinkes I should know you, and know this man,
2820   Yet I am doubtfull: For I am mainely ignorant
2821   What place this is: and all the skill I haue
2822   Remembers not these garments: nor I know not
2823   Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,
2824   For (as I am a man) I thinke this Lady
2825   To be my childe {Cordelia}.
2826   <S {Cor}.> And so I am: I am.
2827   <S {Lear}.> Be your teares wet?
2828   Yes faith: I pray weepe not,
2829   If you haue poyson for me, I will drinke it:
2830   I know you do not loue me, for your Sisters
2831   Haue (as I do remember) done me wrong.
2832   You haue some cause, they haue not.
2833   <S {Cor}.> No cause, no cause.
2834   <S {Lear}.> Am I in France?
2835   <S {Kent}.> In your owne kingdome Sir.
2836   <S {Lear}.> Do not abuse me.
2837   <S {Gent}.> Be comforted good Madam, the great rage
2838   You see is kill'd in him: desire him to go in,
2839   Trouble him no more till further setling.
2840   <S {Cor}.> #Wilt please your Highnesse walke?
2841   <S {Lear}.> You must beare with me:
2842   Pray you now forget, and forgiue,
2843   I am old and foolish.  <D {Exeunt}>

2848   Or whether since he is aduis'd by ought
2849   To change the course, he's full of alteration,
2850   And selfereprouing, bring his constant pleasure.
2851   <S {Reg}.> Our Sisters man is certainely miscarried.
2852   <S {Bast}.>   'Tis to be doubted Madam.
2853   <S {Reg}.> Now sweet Lord,
      <P ss1v>
2854   You know the goodnesse I intend vpon you:
2855   Tell me but truly, but then speake the truth,
2856   Do you not loue my Sister?
2857   <S {Bast}.> In honour'd Loue.
2858   <S {Reg}.> But haue you neuer found my Brothers way,
2859   To the fore- fended place?
2860   <S {Bast}.> No by mine honour, Madam.
2861   <S {Reg}.> I neuer shall endure her, deere my Lord
2862   Be not familiar with her.
2863   <S {Bast}.> Feare not, she and the Duke her husband.
2864   <D {Enter with Drum and Colours, Albany, Gonerill, Soldiers}.>
2865   <S {Alb}.> Our very louing Sister, well be- met:
2866   Sir, this I heard, the King is come to his Daughter
2867   With others, whom the rigour of our State
2868   Forc'd to cry out.
2869   <S {Regan}.> Why is this reasond?
2870   <S {Gone}.> Combine together 'gainst the Enemie:
2871   For these domesticke and particular broiles,
2872   Are not the question heere.
2873   <S {Alb}.> Let's then determine with th' ancient of warre
2874   On our proceeding.
2875   <S {Reg}.> Sister you'le go with vs?
2876   <S {Gon}.> No.
2877   <S {Reg}.> 'Tis most conuenient, pray go with vs.
2878   <S {Gon}.> Oh ho, I know the Riddle, I will goe.

2881  *<S {Edg}.> If ere your Grace had speech with man so poore,
2882   Heare me one word.
2883   <S {Alb}.> Ile ouertake you, speake.
2884   <S {Edg}.> Before you fight the Battaile, ope this Letter:
2885   If you haue victory, let the Trumpet sound
2886   For him that brought it: wretched though I seeme,
2887   I can produce a Champion, that will proue
2888   What is auouched there. If you miscarry,
2889   Your businesse of the world hath so an end,
2890   And machination ceases. Fortune loues you.
2891   <S {Alb}.> Stay till I haue read the Letter.
2892   <S {Edg}.> I was forbid it:
2893   When time shall serue, let but the Herald cry,
2894   And Ile appeare againe.  <D {Exit}.>
2895  *<S {Alb}.> Why farethee well, I will o're- looke thy paper.
2896   <D {Enter Edmund}.>
2897   <S {Bast}.> The Enemy's in view, draw vp your powers,
2898   Heere is the guesse of their true strength and Forces,
2899   By dilligent discouerie, but your #hast
2900   Is now vrg'd on you.
2901   <S {Alb}.> We will greet the time.  <D {Exit}.>
2902   <S {Bast}.> To both these Sisters haue I sworne my loue:
2903   Each iealous of the other, as the stung
2904   Are of the Adder. Which of them shall I take?
2905   Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enioy'd
2906   If both remaine aliue: To take the Widdow,
2907   Exasperates, makes mad her Sister {Gonerill},
2908   And hardly shall I carry out my side,
2909   Her husband being aliue. Now then, wee'l vse
2910   His countenance for the Battaile, which being done,
2911   Let her who would be rid of him, deuise
2912   His speedy taking off. As for the mercie
2913   Which he intends to {Lear} and to {Cordelia},
2914   The Battaile done, and they within our power,
2915   Shall neuer see his pardon: for my state,

2922   For your good hoast: pray that the right may thriue:
2923   If euer I returne to you againe,

2930   Giue me thy hand: Come on.
2931   <S {Glo}.> No further Sir, a man may rot euen heere.
2932   <S {Edg}.> What in #ill thoughts againe?
2933   Men must endure

2942   That are to censure them.
2943   <S {Cor}.> We are not the first,

2945   For thee oppressed King I am cast downe,
2946   My selfe could else out- frowne false Fortunes frowne.
2947   Shall we not see these Daughters, and these Sisters?
2948   <S {Lear}.> No, no, no, no: come let's away to prison,
2949   We two alone will sing like Birds i'th' Cage:
2950   When thou dost aske me blessing, Ile kneele downe
2951   And aske of thee forgiuenesse: So wee'l liue,
2952   And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
2953   At gilded Butterflies: and heere (poore Rogues)
2954   Talke of Court newes, and wee'l talke with them too,
2955   Who looses, and who wins; who's in, who's out;
2956   And take vpon's the mystery of things,

2958   In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
2959   That ebbe and flow by th' Moone.
2960   <S {Bast}.> Take them away.
2961   <S {Lear}.> Vpon such sacrifices my {Cordelia},
2962   The Gods themselues throw Incense.
2963   Haue I caught thee?
2964   He that parts vs, shall bring a Brand from Heauen,
2965   And fire vs hence, like Foxes: wipe thine eyes,
2966   The good yeares shall deuoure them, flesh and fell,
      <P ss2>
2967   Ere they shall make vs weepe?
2968   Weele see 'em staru'd first: come.  <D {Exit}.>
2969   <S {Bast}.> Come hither Captaine, hearke.
2970   Take thou this note, go follow them to prison,
2971   One step I haue aduanc'd thee, if thou do'st
2972   As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
2973   To Noble Fortunes: know thou this, that men
2974   Are as the time is; to be tender minded
2975   Do's not become a Sword, thy great imployment
2976   Will not beare question: either say thou'lt do't,
2977   Or thriue by other meanes.
2978   <S {Capt}.> Ile do't my Lord.
2979   <S {Bast}.> About it, and write happy, when th'hast done,
2980   Marke I say instantly, and carry it so
2981   As I haue set it downe.  <D {Exit Captaine}.>
2982   <D {Flourish. Enter Albany, Gonerill, Regan, Soldiers}.>
2983  *<S {Alb}.> Sir, you haue shew'd to day your valiant straine
2984   And Fortune led you well: you haue the Captiues
2985   Who were the opposites of this dayes strife:
2986   I do require them of you so to vse them,
2987   As we shall find their merites, and our safety
2988   May equally determine.
2989   <S {Bast}.> Sir, I thought it fit,
2990   To send the old and miserable King to some retention,
2991   Whose age had Charmes in it, whose Title more,
2992   To plucke the common bosome on his side,
2993   And turne our imprest Launces in our eies
2994  *Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen:
2995   My reason all the same, and they are ready
2996   To morrow, or at further space, t' appeare
2997   Where you shall hold your Session.
2998   <S {Alb}.> Sir, by your patience,
2999   I hold you but a subiect of this Warre,
3000   Not as a Brother.
3001   <S {Reg}.> That's as we list to grace him.
3002   Methinkes   our pleasure might haue bin demanded
3003   Ere you had spoke so farre. He led our Powers,
3004   Bore the Commission of my place and person,
3005   The which immediacie may well stand vp,
3006   And call it selfe your Brother.
3007   <S {Gon}.> Not so hot:
3008   In his owne grace he doth exalt himselfe,
3009   More then in your addition.
3010   <S {Reg}.> In my rights,
3011   By me inuested, he compeeres the best.
3012  *<S {Alb}.> That were the most, if he should husband you.
3013   <S {Reg}.> Iesters do oft proue Prophets.
3014   <S {Gon}.> Hola, hola,
3015   That eye that told you so, look'd but #a squint.
3016   <S {Rega}.> Lady I am not well, else I should answere
3017   From a full flowing stomack. Generall,
3018   Take thou my Souldiers, prisoners, patrimony,
3019   Dispose of them, of me, the walls is thine:
3020   Witnesse the world, that I create thee heere
3021   My Lord, and Master.
3022   <S {Gon}.> Meane you to enioy him?
3023   <S {Alb}.> The let alone lies not in your good #will.
3024   <S {Bast}.> Nor in thine Lord.
3025   <S {Alb}.> Halfe- blooded fellow, yes.
3026   <S {Reg}.> Let the Drum strike, and proue my title thine.
3027   <S {Alb}.> Stay yet, heare reason: {Edmund}, I arrest thee
3028   On capitall Treason; and in thy arrest,
3029   This guilded Serpent: for your claime faire Sisters,
3030   I bare it in the interest of my wife,
3031   'Tis she is sub- contracted to this Lord,
3032   And I her husband contradict your Banes.
3033   If you will marry, make your loues to me,
3034   My Lady is bespoke.
3035   <S {Gon}.> An enterlude.
3036   <S {Alb}.> Thou art armed {Gloster},
3037   Let the Trumpet sound:
3038   If none appeare to proue vpon thy person,
3039   Thy heynous, manifest, and many Treasons,
3040   There is my pledge: Ile make it on thy heart
3041   Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing lesse
3042   Then I haue heere proclaim'd thee.
3043   <S {Reg}.> Sicke, O sicke.
3044   <S {Gon}.> If not, Ile nere trust medicine.
3045   <S {Bast}.> There's my exchange, what in the world hes
3046   That names me Traitor, villain- like he lies,
3047   Call by the Trumpet: he that dares approach;
3048   On him, on you, who not, I will maintaine
3049   My truth and honor firmely.
3050   <D {Enter a Herald}.>
3051   <S {Alb}.> A Herald, ho.
3052   Trust to thy single vertue, for thy Souldiers
3053   All leuied in my name, haue in my name
3054   Tooke their discharge.
3055   <S {Regan}.> My sicknesse growes vpon me.
3056   <S {Alb}.> She is not well, conuey her to my Tent.
3057   Come hither Herald, let the Trumpet sound,
3058   And read out this.  <D {A Trumpet sounds}.>
3059   <D {Herald reads}.>
3060  *{If any man of qualitie or degree, within the lists of the Ar-my},
3061  *{will maintaine vpon Edmund, supposed Earle of Gloster},
3062  *{that he is a manifold Traitor, let him appeare by the third}
3063  *{sound of the Trumpet: he is bold in his defence}.  <D 1 {Trumpet}.>
3064   <S {Her}.> Againe.  <D 2 {Trumpet}.>
3065   <S {Her}.> Againe.  <D 3 {Trumpet}.>
3066   <D {Trumpet answers within}.>
3067   <D {Enter Edgar armed}.>
3068   <S {Alb}.> Aske him his purposes, why he appeares
3069   Vpon this Call o'th' Trumpet.
3070   <S {Her}.> What are you?
3071   Your name, your quality, and why you answer
3072   This present Summons?
3073   <S {Edg}.> Know my name is lost
3074   By Treasons tooth: bare- gnawne, and Canker- bit,
3075   Yet am I Noble as the Aduersary
3076   I come to cope.
3077   <S {Alb}.> Which is that Aduersary?
3078  *<S {Edg}.> What's he that speakes for {Edmund} Earle of Glo-|(ster?
3079   <S {Bast}.> Himselfe, what saist thou to him?
3080   <S {Edg}.> Draw thy Sword,
3081   That if my speech offend a Noble heart,
3082   Thy arme may do thee Iustice, heere is mine:
3083   Behold it is my priuiledge,
3084   The priuiledge of mine Honours,
3085   My oath, and my profession. I protest,
3086   Maugre thy strength, place, youth, and eminence,
3087   Despise thy victor- Sword, and fire new Fortune,
3088   Thy valor, and thy heart, thou art a Traitor:
3089   False to thy Gods, thy Brother, and thy Father,
3090   Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious Prince,
3091   And from th' extremest vpward of thy head,
3092   To the discent and dust below thy foote,
      <P ss2v>
3093   A most Toad- spotted Traitor. Say thou no,
3094   This Sword, this arme, and my best spirits are bent
3095   To proue vpon thy heart, where to I speake,
3096   Thou lyest.
3097   <S {Bast}.> In wisedome I should aske thy name,
3098   But since thy out- side lookes so faire and Warlike,
3099   And that thy tongue (some say) of breeding breathes,
3100   What safe, and nicely I might well delay,
3101   By rule of Knight- hood, I disdaine and spurne:
3102   Backe do I tosse these Treasons to thy head,
3103   With the hell- hated Lye, ore- whelme thy heart,
3104   Which for they yet glance by, and scarcely bruise,
3105   This Sword of mine shall giue them instant way,
3106   Where they shall rest for euer. Trumpets speake.
3107   <S {Alb}.> Saue him, saue him.  <D {Alarums. Fights}.>
3108   <S {Gon}.> This is practise {Gloster},
3109   By th' law of Warre, thou wast not bound to answer
3110   An vnknowne opposite: thou art not vanquish'd,
3111   But cozend, and beguild.
3112   <S {Alb}.> Shut your mouth Dame,
3113   Or with this paper shall I stop it: hold Sir,
3114   Thou worse then any name, reade thine owne euill:
3115   No tearing Lady, I perceiue you know it.
3116   <S {Gon}.> Say if I do, the Lawes are mine not thine,
3117   Who can araigne me for't?  <D {Exit}.>
3118   <S {Alb}.> Most monstrous! O, know'st thou this paper?
3119   <S {Bast}.> Aske me not what I know.
3120   <S {Alb}.> Go after her, she's desperate, gouerne her.
3121   <S {Bast}.> What you haue charg'd me with,
3122   That haue I done,
3123   And more, much more, the time will bring it out.
3124   'Tis past, and so am I: But what art thou
3125   That hast this Fortune on me? If thou'rt Noble,
3126   I do forgiue thee.
3127   <S {Edg}.> Let's exchange charity:
3128   I am no lesse in blood then thou art {Edmond},
3129   If more, the more th'hast wrong'd me.
3130   My name is {Edgar} and thy Fathers Sonne,
3131   The Gods are iust, and of our pleasant vices
3132   Make instruments to plague vs:
3133   The darke and vitious place where thee he got,
3134   Cost him his eyes.
3135   <S {Bast}.> Th'hast spoken right, 'tis true,
3136   The Wheele is come full circle, I am heere.
3137   <S {Alb}.> Me thought thy very gate did prophesie
3138   A Royall Noblenesse: I must embrace thee,
3139   Let sorrow split my heart, if euer I
3140   Did hate thee, or thy Father.
3141   <S {Edg}.> Worthy Prince I know't.
3142   <S {Alb}.> Where haue you hid your selfe?
3143   How haue you knowne the miseries of your Father?
3144   <S {Edg}.> By nursing them my Lord. List a breefe tale,
3145   And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst.
3146   The bloody proclamation to escape
3147   That follow'd me so neere, (O our liues sweetnesse,
3148   That we the paine of death would hourely dye,
3149   Rather then die at once) taught me to shift
3150   Into a mad- mans rags, t' assume a semblance
3151   That very Dogges disdain'd: and in this habit
3152   Met I my Father with his bleeding Rings,
3153   Their precious Stones new lost: became his guide,
3154   Led him, begg'd for him, sau'd him from dispaire.
3155   Neuer (O fault) reueal'd my selfe vnto him,
3156   Vntill some halfe houre past when I was arm'd,
3157   Not sure, though hoping of this good successe,
3158   I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
3159   Told him our pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart
3160   (Alacke too weake the conflict to support)
3161   Twixt two extremes of passion, ioy and greefe,
3162   Burst smilingly.
3163   <S {Bast}.> This speech of yours hath mou'd me,
3164   And shall perchance do good, but speake you on,
3165   You looke as you had something more to say.
3166   <S {Alb}.> If there be more, more wofull, hold it in,
3167   For I am almost ready to dissolue,
3168   Hearing of this.
3169   <D {Enter a Gentleman}.>
3170   <S {Gen}.> Helpe, helpe: O helpe.
3171   <S {Edg}.> What kinde of helpe?
3172   <S {Alb}.> Speake man.
3173   <S {Edg}.> What meanes this bloody Knife?
3174  *<S {Gen}.> 'Tis hot, it smoakes, it came euen from the heart
3175   of=== O she's dead.
3176   <S {Alb}.> Who dead? Speake man.
3177   <S {Gen}.> Your Lady Sir, your Lady; and her Sister
3178   By her is poyson'd: she confesses it.
3179   <S {Bast}.> I was contracted to them both, all three
3180   Now marry in an instant.
3181   <S {Edg}.> Here comes {Kent}.
3182   <D {Enter Kent}.>
3183   <S {Alb}.> Produce the bodies, be they aliue or dead;
3184   <D {Gonerill and Regans bodies brought out}.>
3185   This iudgement of the Heauens that makes vs tremble.
3186   Touches vs not with pitty: O, is this he?
3187   The time will not allow the complement
3188   Which very manners vrges.
3189   <S {Kent}.> I am come
3190   To bid my King and Master aye good night.
3191   Is he not here?
3192   <S {Alb}.> Great thing of vs forgot,
3193  *Speake {Edmund}, where's the King? and where's {Cordelia}?
3194   Seest thou this obiect {Kent}?
3195   <S {Kent}.> Alacke, why thus?
3196   <S {Bast}.> Yet {Edmund} was belou'd:
3197   The one the other poison'd for my sake,
3198   And after slew herselfe.
3199   <S {Alb}.> Euen so: couer their faces.
3200   <S {Bast}.> I pant for life: some good I meane to do
3201   Despight of mine owne Nature. Quickly send,
3202   (Be briefe in it) to'th' Castle, for my Writ
3203   Is on the life of {Lear}, and on {Cordelia}:
3204   Nay, send in time.
3205   <S {Alb}.> Run, run, O run.
3206   <S {Edg}.> To who my Lord? Who ha's the Office?
3207   Send thy token of repreeue.
3208   <S {Bast}.> Well thought on, take my Sword,
3209   Giue it the Captaine.
3210   <S {Edg}.> #Hast thee for thy life.
3211   <S {Bast}.> He hath Commission from thy Wife and me,
3212   To hang {Cordelia} in the prison, and
3213   To lay the blame vpon her owne dispaire,
3214   That she for- did her selfe.
3215   <S {Alb}.> The Gods defend her, beare him hence awhile.
3216   <D {Enter Lear with Cordelia in his armes}.>
3217  *<S {Lear}.> Howle, howle, howle: O you are men of stones,
3218   Had I your tongues and eyes, Il'd vse them so,
3219   That Heauens vault should crack: she's gone for euer.
3220   I know when one is dead, and when one liues,
3221   She's dead as earth: Lend me a Looking- glasse,
      <P ss3>
3222   If that her breath will mist or staine the stone,
3223   Why then she liues.
3224   <S {Kent}.> Is this the promis'd end?
3225   <S {Edg}.> Or image of that horror.
3226   <S {Alb}.> Fall and cease.
3227   <S {Lear}.> This feather stirs, she liues: if it be so,
3228   It is a chance which do's redeeme all sorrowes
3229   That euer I haue felt.
3230   <S {Kent}.> O my good Master.
3231   <S {Lear}.> Prythee away.
3232   <S {Edg}.> 'Tis Noble {Kent} your Friend.
3233   <S {Lear}.> A plague vpon you Murderors, Traitors all,
3234   I might haue sau'd her, now she's gone for euer:
3235   {Cordelia}, {Cordelia}, stay a little. Ha:
3236   What is't thou saist? Her voice was euer soft,
3237   Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
3238   I kill'd the Slaue that was #a hanging thee.
3239   <S {Gent}.> 'Tis true (my Lords) he did.
3240   <S {Lear}.> Did I not fellow?
3241   I haue seene the day, with my good biting Faulchion
3242   I would haue made him skip: I am old now,
3243   And these same crosses spoile me. Who are you?
3244   Mine eyes are not o'th' best, Ile tell you straight.
3245   <S {Kent}.> If Fortune brag of two, she lou'd and hated,
3246   One of them we behold.
3247   <S {Lear}.> This is a dull sight, are you not {Kent}?
3248   <S {Kent}.> The same: your Seruant {Kent},
3249   Where is your Seruant {Caius}?
3250   <S {Lear}.> He's a good fellow, I can tell you that,
3251   He'le strike and quickly too, he's dead and rotten.
3252   <S {Kent}.> No my good Lord, I am the very man.
3253   <S {Lear}.> Ile see that straight.
3254   <S {Kent}.> That from your first of difference and decay,
3255   Haue follow'd your sad steps.
3256   <S {Lear}.> You are welcome hither.
3257   <S {Kent}.> Nor no man else:
3258   All's cheerlesse, darke, and deadly,
3259   Your eldest Daughters haue fore- done themselues,
3260   And desperately are dead
3261   <S {Lear}.> #I so I thinke.
3262   <S {Alb}.> He knowes not what he saies, and vaine is it
3263   That we present vs to him.
3264   <D {Enter a Messenger}.>
3265   <S {Edg}.> Very bootlesse.
3266   <S {Mess}.> {Edmund} is dead my Lord.
3267   <S {Alb}.> That's but a trifle heere:
3268   You Lords and Noble Friends, know our intent,
3269   What comfort to this great decay may come,
3270   Shall be appli'd. For vs we will resigne,
3271   During the life of this old Maiesty
3272   To him our absolute power, you to your rights,
3273   With boote, and such addition as your Honours
3274   Haue more then merited. All Friends shall
3275   Taste the wages of their vertue, and all Foes
3276   The cup of their deseruings: O see, see.
3277  *<S {Lear}.> And my poore Foole is hang'd: no, no, no life?
3278   Why should a Dog, a Horse, a Rat haue life,
3279   And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
3280   Neuer, neuer, neuer, neuer, neuer.
3281   Pray you vndo this Button. Thanke you Sir,
3282   Do you see this? Looke on her? Looke her lips,
3283   Looke there, looke there.  <D {He dies}.>
3284   <S {Edg}.> He faints, my Lord, my Lord.
3285   <S {Kent}.> Breake heart, I prythee breake.
3286   <S {Edg}.> Looke vp my Lord.
3287  *<S {Kent}.> Vex not his ghost, O let him passe, he hates him,
3288   That would vpon the wracke of this tough world
3289   Stretch him out longer.
3290   <S {Edg}.> He is gon indeed.
3291   <S {Kent}.> The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long,
3292   He but vsurpt his life.
3293   <S {Alb}.> Beare them from hence, our present businesse
3294   Is generall woe: Friends of my soule, you twaine,
3295   Rule in this Realme, and the gor'd state sustaine.
3296   <S {Kent}.> I haue a iourney Sir, shortly to go,
3297   My Master calls me, I must not say no.
3298   <S {Edg}.> The waight of this sad time we must obey,
3299   Speake what we feele, not what we ought to say:
3300   The oldest hath borne most, we that are yong,
3301   Shall neuer see so much, nor liue so long.
