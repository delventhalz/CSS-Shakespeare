6      <S {Saturninus}.>
7      Noble Patricians, Patrons of my right,
8      Defend the iustice of my Cause with Armes.
9      And Countrey- men, my louing Followers,
10    *Pleade my Successiue Title with your Swords.
11     I was the first borne Sonne, that was the last
12     That wore the Imperiall Diadem of Rome:
13     Then let my Fathers Honours liue in me,
14     Nor wrong mine Age with this indignitie.
15     <S {Bassianus}.> Romaines, Friends, Followers,
16     Fauourers of my Right:
17     If euer {Bassianus}, {Caesars} Sonne,
18     Were gracious in the eyes of Royall Rome,
19     Keepe then this passage to the Capitoll:
20     And suffer not Dishonour to approach
21     Th' Imperiall Seate to Vertue: consecrate
22     To Iustice, Continence, and Nobility:
23     But let Desert in pure Election shine;
24     And Romanes, fight for Freedome in your Choice.
25     <D {Enter Marcus Andronicus aloft with the Crowne}.>
26     Princes, that striue by Factions, and by Friends,
27     Ambitiously for Rule and Empery:
28     Know, that the people of Rome for whom we stand
29     A speciall Party, haue by Common voyce
30     In Election for the Romane Emperie,
31     Chosen {Andronicus}, Sur- named {Pious},
32     For many good and great deserts to Rome.
33     A Nobler man, a brauer Warriour,
34     Liues not this day within the City Walles.
35     He by the Senate is accited home
36     From weary Warres against the barbarous Gothes,
37     That with his Sonnes (a terror to our Foes)
38     Hath yoak'd a Nation strong, train'd vp in Armes.
39     Ten yeares are spent, since first he vndertooke
40     This Cause of Rome, and chasticed with Armes
41     Our Enemies pride. Fiue times he hath return'd
42     Bleeding to Rome, bearing his Valiant Sonnes
43     In Coffins from the Field.
44     And now at last, laden with Honours Spoyles,
45     Returnes the good {Andronicus} to Rome,
46     Renowned {Titus}, flourishing in Armes.
47     Let vs intreat, by Honour of his Name,
48     Whom (worthily) you would haue now succeede,
49     And in the Capitoll and Senates right,
50     Whom you pretend to Honour and Adore,
51     That you withdraw you, and abate your Strength,
52     Dismisse your Followers, and as Suters should,
53     Pleade your Deserts in Peace and Humblenesse.
54     <S {Saturnine}.> How fayre the Tribune speakes,
55     To calme my thoughts.
56     <S {Bassia}.> {Marcus Andronicus}, so I do affie
57     In thy vprightnesse and Integrity:
58     And so I Loue and Honor thee, and thine,
59     Thy Noble Brother {Titus}, and his Sonnes,
60     And Her (to whom my thoughts are humbled all)
61     Gracious {Lauinia}, Romes rich Ornament,
62     That I will heere dismisse my louing Friends:
63     And to my Fortunes, and the Peoples Fauour,
64     Commit my Cause in ballance to be weigh'd.
65     <D {Exit Souldiours}.>
66     <S {Saturnine}.> Friends, that haue beene
67     Thus forward in my Right,
68     I thanke you all, and heere Dismisse you all,
69     And to the Loue and Fauour of my Countrey,
70     Commit my Selfe, my Person, and the Cause:
71     Rome, be as iust and gracious vnto me,
72     As I am confident and kinde to thee.

75     <D {Flourish.  They go vp into the Senat house}.>
76     <D {Enter a Captaine}.>
77     <S {Cap}.> Romanes make way: the good {Andronicus},
78     Patron of Vertue, Romes best Champion,
79     Successefull in the Battailes that he fights,
80     With Honour and with Fortune is return'd,
81     From whence he circumscribed with his Sword,
82     And brought to yoke the Enemies of Rome.

90     <S {Andronicus}.> Haile Rome:
91     Victorious in thy Mourning Weedes:
      <P cc4v><C E>
92     Loe as the Barke that hath discharg'd his fraught,
93     Returnes with precious lading to the Bay,
94     From whence at first she weigh'd her Anchorage:
95     Commeth {Andronicus} bound with Lawrell bowes,
96     To resalute his Country with his teares,
97     Teares of true ioy for his returne to Rome,
98     Thou great defender of this Capitoll,
99     Stand gracious to the Rites that we intend.
100    Romaines, of fiue and twenty Valiant Sonnes,
101    Halfe of the number that King {Priam} had,
102    Behold the poore remaines aliue and dead!
103    These that Suruiue, let Rome reward with Loue:
104    These that I bring vnto their latest home,
105    With buriall amongst their Auncestors.
106   *Heere Gothes haue giuen me leaue to sheath my Sword:
107    {#Titus} vnkinde, and carelesse of thine owne,
108    Why suffer'st thou thy Sonnes vnburied yet,
109    To houer on the dreadfull shore of Stix?
110    Make way to lay them by their Bretheren.
111    <D {They open the Tombe}.>
112    There greete in silence as the dead are wont,
113    And sleepe in peace, slaine in your Countries warres:
114    O sacred receptacle of my ioyes,
115    Sweet Cell of vertue and Nobilitie,
116    How many Sonnes of mine hast thou in store,
117    That thou wilt neuer render to me more?
118    <S {Luc}.> Giue vs the proudest prisoner of the Gothes,
119    That we may hew his limbes, and on a pile
120    {Ad manus fratrum}, sacrifice his flesh:
121    Before this earthly prison of their bones,
122    That so the shadowes be not vnappeas'd,
123    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
124    <S {Tit}.> I giue him you, the Noblest that Suruiues,
125    The eldest Son of this distressed Queene.
126   *<S {Tam}.> Stay Romaine Bretheren, gracious Conqueror,
127    Victorious {Titus}, rue the teares I shed,
128    A Mothers teares in passion for her sonne:
129    And if thy Sonnes were euer deere to thee,
130    Oh thinke my sonnes to be as deere to mee.
131    Sufficeth not, that we are brought to Rome
132    To beautifie thy Triumphs, and returne
133    Captiue to thee, and to thy Romaine yoake,
134    But must my Sonnes be slaughtred in the streetes,
135    For Valiant doings in their Countries cause?
136    O! If to fight for King and Common- weale,
137    Were piety in thine, it is in these:
138    {#Andronicus}, staine not thy Tombe with blood.
139    Wilt thou draw neere the nature of the Gods?
140    Draw neere them then in being mercifull.
141    Sweet mercy is Nobilities true badge,
142    Thrice Noble {Titus}, spare my first borne sonne.
143    <S {Tit}.> Patient your selfe Madam, and pardon me.
144    These are the Brethren, whom you Gothes beheld
145    Aliue and dead, and for their Bretheren slaine,
146    Religiously they aske a sacrifice:
147    To this your sonne is markt, and die he must,
148    T' appease their groaning shadowes that are gone.
149    <S {Luc}.> Away with him, and make a fire straight,
150    And with our Swords vpon a pile of wood,
151    Let's hew his limbes till they be cleane consum'd.
152    <D {Exit Sonnes with Alarbus}.>
153    <S {Tamo}.> O cruell irreligious piety.
154    <S {Chi}.> Was euer Scythia halfe so barbarous?
155    <S {Dem}.> Oppose me Scythia to ambitious Rome,
156    {Alarbus} goes to rest, and we suruiue,
157    To tremble vnder {Titus} threatning lookes.
158    Then Madam stand resolu'd, but hope withall,
159    The selfe same Gods that arm'd the Queene of Troy
160    With opportunitie of sharpe reuenge
161    Vpon the Thracian Tyrant in his Tent,
162    May fauour {Tamora} the Queene of Gothes,
163   *(When Gothes were Gothes, and {Tamora} was Queene)
164    To quit the bloody wrongs vpon her foes.
165    <D {Enter the Sonnes of Andronicus againe}.>
166    <S {Luci}.> See Lord and Father, how we haue perform'd
167    Our Romaine rightes, {Alarbus} limbs are lopt,
168    And intrals feede the sacrifising fire,
169    Whole smoke like incense doth perfume the skie.
170    Remaineth nought but to interre our Brethren,
171    And with low'd Larums welcome them to Rome.
172    <S {Tit}.> Let it be so, and let {Andronicus}
173    Make this his latest farewell to their Soules.
174    <D {Flourish}.>
175    <D {Then Sound Trumpets, and lay the Coffins in the Tombe}.>
176    In peace and Honour rest you heere my Sonnes,
177    Romes readiest Champions, repose you heere in rest,
178    Secure from worldly chaunces and mishaps:
179    Heere lurks no Treason, heere no enuie swels,
180    Heere grow no damned grudges, heere are no stormes,
181    No noyse, but silence and Eternall sleepe,
182    In peace and Honour rest you heere my Sonnes.
183    <D {Enter Lauinia}.>
184    <S {Laui}.> In peace and Honour, liue Lord {Titus} long,
185    My Noble Lord and Father, liue in Fame:
186    Loe at this Tombe my tributarie teares,
187    I render for my Bretherens Obsequies:
188    And at thy feete I kneele, with teares of ioy
189    Shed on the earth for thy returne to Rome.
190    O blesse me heere with thy victorious hand,
191    Whose Fortune Romes best Citizens applau'd.
192    <S {Ti}.> Kind Rome,
193    That hast thus louingly reseru'd
194    The Cordiall of mine age to glad my hart,

196    And Fames eternall date for vertues praise.
197    <S {Marc}.> Long liue Lord {Titus}, my beloued brother,
198    Gracious Triumpher in the eyes of Rome.
199    <S {Tit}.> Thankes Gentle Tribune,
200    Noble brother {Marcus}.
201   *<S {Mar}.> And welcome Nephews from succesfull wars,
202    You that suruiue and you that sleepe in Fame:
203    Faire Lords your Fortunes are all alike in all,

205    But safer Triumph is this Funerall Pompe,
206    That hath aspir'd to {Solons} Happines,
207    And Triumphs ouer chaunce in honours bed.
208    {#Titus Andronicus}, the people of Rome,
209    Whose friend in iustice thou hast euer bene,

212    And name thee in Election for the Empire,
213    With these our late deceased Emperours Sonnes:
214    Be {Candidatus} then, and put it on,
215    And helpe to set a head on headlesse Rome.
216    <S {Tit}.> A better head her Glorious body fits,
217    Then his that shakes for age and feeblenesse:

218    What should I #don this Robe and trouble you,
219    Be chosen with proclamations to day,
220    To morrow yeeld vp rule, resigne my life,
221    And set abroad new businesse for you all.
222    Rome I haue bene thy Souldier forty yeares,
223    And led my Countries strength successefully,
224    And buried one and twenty Valiant Sonnes,
225    Knighted in Field, slaine manfully in Armes,
226    In right and Seruice of their Noble Countrie:
227    Giue me a staffe of Honour for mine age,
228    But not a Scepter to controule the world,
229    Vpright he held it Lords, that held it last.

233    <S {Sat}.> Romaines do me right.
234    Patricians draw your Swords, and sheath them not
235    Till {Saturninus} be Romes Emperour:
236    {#Andronicus} would thou wert shipt to #hell,
237    Rather then rob me of the peoples harts.
238    <S {Luc}.> Proud {Saturnine}, interrupter of the good
239    That Noble minded {Titus} meanes to thee.
240    <S {Tit}.> Content thee Prince, I will restore to thee
241    The peoples harts, and weane them from themselues.
242    <S {Bass}.> {Andronicus}, I do not flatter thee
243    But Honour thee, and will doe till I die:

245    I will most thankefull be, and thankes to men
246    Of Noble mindes, is Honourable Meede.
247    <S {Tit}.> People of Rome, and Noble Tribunes heere,

252    The people will accept whom he admits.
253    <S {Tit}.> Tribunes I thanke you, and this sure I make,
254    That you Create your Emperours eldest sonne,
255    Lord {Saturnine}, whose Vertues will I hope,
256    Reflect on Rome as Tytans Rayes on earth,
257    And ripen Iustice in this Common- weale:

284    <S {Satu}.> Thankes Noble {Titus}, Father of my life,
285    How proud I am of thee, and of thy gifts
286    Rome shall record, and when I do forget

321    And with my Sword Ile keepe this doore safe.
322    <S {Tit}.> Follow my Lord, and Ile soone bring her backe.

328    <S {Tit}.> Nor thou, nor he are any sonnes of mine,
329    My sonnes would neuer so dishonour me.
330    Traytor restore {Lauinia} to the Emperour.
331    <S {Luc}.> Dead if you will, but not to be his wife,
332    That is anothers lawfull promist Loue.
333    <D {Enter aloft the Emperour with Tamora and her two}
334    {sonnes, and Aaron the Moore}.>
335    <S {Empe}.> No {Titus}, no, the Emperour needs her not,

337    Ile trust by Leisure him that mocks me once.
338    Thee neuer: nor thy Trayterous haughty sonnes,
339    Confederates all, thus to dishonour me.
340    Was none in Rome to make a stale

342    Agree these Deeds, with that proud bragge of thine,
343    That said'st, I beg'd the Empire at thy hands.
344   *<S {Tit}.> O monstrous, what reproachfull words are these?
345   *<S {Sat}.> But goe thy wayes, goe giue that changing peece,
346    To him that flourisht for her with his Sword:
347    A Valliant sonne in- law thou shalt enioy:
348    One, fit to bandy with thy lawlesse Sonnes,
      <P cc5v>
349    To ruffle in the Common- wealth of Rome.
350    <S {Tit}.> These words are Razors to my wounded hart.
351    <S {Sat}.> And therefore louely {Tamora} Queene of Gothes,
352    That like the stately {Thebe} mong'st her Nimphs
353    Dost ouer- shine the Gallant'st Dames of Rome,

360    And Tapers burne so bright, and euery thing
361    In readines for {Hymeneus} stand,
362    I will not resalute the streets of Rome,
363    Or clime my Pallace, till from forth this place,
364    I leade espous'd my Bride along with me.
365   *<S {Tamo}.> And heere in sight of heauen to Rome I sweare,
366    If {Saturnine} aduance the Queen of Gothes,
367    Shee will a Hand- maid be to his desires,
368    A louing Nurse, a Mother to his youth.
369    <S {Satur}.> Ascend Faire Queene,
370    Panthean Lords, accompany
371    Your Noble Emperour and his louely Bride,
372    Sent by the heauens for Prince {Saturnine},

378    Dishonoured thus and Challenged of wrongs?
379    <D {Enter Marcus and Titus Sonnes}.>
380    <S {Mar}.> O {Titus} see! O see what thou hast done!
381    In a bad quarrell, slaine a Vertuous sonne.
382    <S {Tit}.> No foolish Tribune, no: No sonne of mine,
383    Nor thou, nor these Confedrates in the deed,
384    That hath dishonoured all our Family,
385    Vnworthy brother, and vnworthy Sonnes.
386    <S {Luci}.> But let vs giue him buriall as becomes:
387    Giue {Mutius} buriall with our Bretheren.
388    <S {Tit}.> Traytors away, he rest's not in this Tombe:
389    This Monument fiue hundreth yeares hath stood,
390    Which I haue Sumptuously re- edified.
391    Heere none but Souldiers, and Romes Seruitors,
392    Repose in Fame: None basely slaine in braules,
393    Bury him where you can, he comes not heere.
394    <S {Mar}.> My Lord this is impiety in you,
395    My Nephew {Mutius} deeds do plead for him,
396    He must be buried with his bretheren.
397    <S {Titus two Sonnes speakes}.>
398    And #shall, or him we will accompany.
399   *<S {Ti}.> And #shall! What villaine was it spake that word?
400    <S {Titus sonne speakes}.>
401    He that would vouch'd it in any place but heere.
402    <S {Tit}.> What would you bury him in my despight?
403    <S {Mar}.> No Noble {Titus}, but intreat of thee,
404    To pardon {Mutius}, and to bury him.
405    <S {Tit}.> {Marcus}, Euen thou hast stroke vpon my Crest,
406   *And with these Boyes mine Honour thou hast wounded,
407    My foes I doe repute you euery one.
408    So trouble me no more, but get you gone.
409    <S 1.{Sonne}.> He is not himselfe, let vs withdraw.
410    <S 2.{Sonne}.> Not I tell {Mutius} bones be buried.
411    <D {The Brother and the sonnes kneele}.>
412    <S {Mar}.> Brother, for in that name doth nature plea'd.
413   *<S 2.{Sonne}.> Father, and in that name doth nature speake.
414    <S {Tit}.> Speake thou no more if all the rest will speede.
415    <S {Mar}.> Renowned {Titus} more then halfe my soule.
416    <S {Luc}.> Deare Father, soule and substance of vs all.
417    <S {Mar}.> Suffer thy brother {Marcus} to interre
418    His Noble Nephew heere in vertues nest,
419    That died in Honour and {Lauinia's} cause.
420    Thou art a Romaine, be not barbarous:
421    The Greekes vpon aduise did bury {Aiax}
422    That slew himselfe: And {Laertes} sonne,
423    Did graciously plead for his Funerals:
424    Let not young {Mutius} then that was thy ioy,
425    Be bar'd his entrance heere.
426    <S {Tit}.> Rise {Marcus}, rise,
427    The dismall'st day is this that ere I saw,
428    To be dishonored by my Sonnes in Rome:
429    Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
430    <D {They put him in the Tombe}.>
431    <S {Luc}.> There lie thy bones sweet {Mutius} with thy |(friends.
432    Till we with Trophees do adorne thy Tombe.
433    <D {They all kneele and say}.>
434    No man shed teares for Noble {Mutius},
435    He liues in Fame, that #di'd in vertues cause.  <D {Exit}.>
436    <S {Mar}.> My Lord to step out of these sudden dumps,
437    How comes it that the subtile Queene of Gothes,
438    Is of a sodaine thus aduanc'd in Rome?
439    <S {Ti}.> I know not {Marcus}: but I know it is,
440    (Whether by deuise or no) the heauens can tell,
441    Is she not then beholding to the man,
442    That brought her for this high good turne so farre?
443    Yes, and will Nobly him remunerate.
444    <D {Flourish}.>
445   *<D {Enter the Emperor, Tamora, and her two sons, with the Moore}
446    {at one doore. Enter at the other doore Bassianus and}
447    {#Lauinia with others}.>
448    <S {Sat}.> So {Bassianus}, you haue plaid your prize,
449    God giue you ioy sir of your Gallant Bride.
450    <S {Bass}.> And you of yours my Lord: I say no more,
451    Nor wish no lesse, and so I take my leaue.
452    <S {Sat}.> Traytor, if Rome haue law, or we haue power,
453    Thou and thy Faction shall repent this Rape.
454    <S {Bass}.> Rape call you it my Lord, to cease my owne,
455    My true betrothed Loue, and now my wife?
456    But let the lawes of Rome determine all,
457    Meane while I am possest of that is mine.
458    <S {Sat}.> 'Tis good sir: you are very short with vs,
459    But if we liue, weele be as sharpe with you.
460    <S {Bass}.> My Lord, what I haue done as best I may,
461    Answere I must, and shall do with my life,
462    Onely thus much I giue your Grace to know,
463    By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
464    This Noble Gentleman Lord {Titus} heere,
465    Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,
466    That in the rescue of {Lauinia},
467    With his owne hand did slay his youngest Son,
468    In zeale to you, and highly mou'd to wrath.
469    To be controul'd in that he frankly gaue:
470    Receiue him then to fauour {Saturnine},
471    That hath expre'st himselfe in all his deeds,
472    A Father and a friend to thee, and Rome.
473    <S {Tit}.> Prince {Bassianus} leaue to plead my Deeds,
474    'Tis thou, and those, that haue dishonoured me,
475    Rome and the righteous heauens be my iudge,
476    How I haue lou'd and Honour'd  {Saturnine}.
477    <S {Tam}.> My worthy Lord if euer {Tamora},
      <P cc6>
478    Were gracious in those Princely eyes of thine,
479    Then heare me speake indifferently for all:
480    And at my sute (sweet) pardon what is past.
481    <S {Satu}.> What Madam, be dishonoured openly,
482    And basely put it vp without reuenge?
483    <S {Tam}.> Not so my Lord,
484    The Gods of Rome fore- fend,
485    I should be Authour to dishonour you.
486    But on mine honour dare, I vndertake
487    For good Lord {Titus} innocence in all:
488    Whose fury not dissembled speakes his griefes:
489    Then at my sute looke graciously on him,
490    Loose not so noble a friend on vaine suppose,
491    Nor with sowre lookes afflict his gentle heart.
492    My Lord, be rul'd by me, be wonne at last,
493    Dissemble all your griefes and discontents,
494    You are but newly planted in your Throne,
495    Least then the people, and Patricians too,
496    Vpon a iust suruey take {Titus} part,
497    And so supplant vs for ingratitude,
498    Which Rome reputes to be a hainous sinne.
499    Yeeld at intreats, and then let me alone:
500    Ile finde a day to massacre them all,
501    And race their faction, and their familie,
502    The cruell Father, and his trayt'rous sonnes,
503    To whom I sued for my deare sonnes life.
504    And make them know what 'tis to let a Queene.
505    Kneele in the streetes, and beg for grace in vaine.
506    Come, come, sweet Emperour, (come {Andronicus})
507    Take vp this good old man, and cheere the heart,
508    That dies in tempest of thy angry frowne.
509    <S {King}.> Rise {Titus}, rise,
510    My Empresse hath preuail'd.
511    <S {Titus}.> I thanke your Maiestie,
512    And her my Lord.
513    These words, these lookes,
514    Infuse new life in me.
515    <S {Tamo}.> {Titus}, I am incorparate in Rome,
516    A Roman now adopted happily.
517    And must aduise the Emperour for his good,
518    This day all quarrels die {Andronicus}.
519    And let it be mine honour good my Lord,
520    That I haue reconcil'd your friends and you.
521    For you Prince {Bassianus}, I haue past
522    My word and promise to the Emperour,
523    That you will be more milde and tractable.
524    And feare not Lords:
525    And you {Lauinia},
526    By my aduise all humbled on your knees,
527    You shall aske pardon of his Maiestie.
528    <S {Son}.> We doe,
529    And vow to heauen, and to his Highnes,
530    That what we did, was mildly, as we might,
531    Tendring our sisters honour and our owne.
532    <S {Mar}.> That on mine honour heere I do protest.
533    <S {King}.> Away and talke not, trouble vs no more.
534    <S {Tamora}.> Nay, nay,
535    Sweet Emperour, we must all be friends,
536    The Tribune and his Nephews kneele for grace,
537    I will not be denied, sweet hart looke back.
538    <S {King}.> {Marcus},
539    For thy sake and thy brothers heere,
540    And at my louely {Tamora's} intreats,
541    I doe remit these young mens haynous faults.
542    Stand vp: {Lauinia}, though you left me like a churle,
543    I found a friend, and sure as death I sware,
544    I would not part a Batchellour from the Priest.
545    Come, if the Emperours Court can feast two Brides,
546    You are my guest {Lauinia}, and your friends:
547    This day shall be a Loue- day {Tamora}.
548    <S {Tit}.> To morrow #and it please your Maiestie,
549    To hunt the Panther and the Hart with me,
550    With horne and Hound,
551    Weele giue your Grace {Bon iour}.
552    <S {Satur}.> Be it so {Titus}, and Gramercy #to.  <D {Exeunt}.>
553    <Z {Actus Secunda}.>
554    <D {Flourish.  Enter Aaron alone}.>
555    <S {Aron}.> Now climbeth {Tamora} Olympus toppe,
556    Safe out of Fortunes shot, and sits aloft,
557    Secure of Thunders cracke or lightning flash,
558    Aduanc'd about pale enuies threatning reach:
559    As when the golden Sunne salutes the morne,
560    And hauing gilt the Ocean with his beames,
561    Gallops the Zodiacke in his glistering Coach,
562    And ouer- lookes the highest piering hills:
563    So {Tamora}
564    Vpon her wit doth earthly honour waite,
565    And vertue stoopes and trembles at her frowne.
566    Then {Aaron} arme thy hart, and fit thy thoughts,
567    To mount aloft with thy Emperiall Mistris,
568    And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
569    Hast prisoner held, fettred in amorous chaines,
570    And faster bound to {Aarons} charming eyes,
571    Then is {Prometheus} ti'de to {Caucasus}.
572    Away with slauish weedes, and idle thoughts,
573    I will be bright and shine in Pearle and Gold,
574    To waite vpon this new made Empresse.
575    To waite said I? To wanton with this Queene,
576    This Goddesse, this {Semirimis}, this Queene.
577    This Syren, that will charme Romes {Saturnine},
578    And see his shipwracke, and his Common weales.
579    Hollo, what storme is this?
580    <D {Enter Chiron and Demetrius brauing}.>
581   *<S {Dem}.> {Chiron} thy yeres wants wit, thy wit wants edge
582    And manners to intru'd where I am grac'd,
583    And may for ought thou know'st affected be.
584    <S {Chi}.> {Demetrius}, thou doo'st ouer- weene in all,
585    And so in this, to beare me downe with braues,
586    'Tis not the difference of a yeere or two
587    Makes me lesse gracious, or thee more fortunate:
588    I am as able, and as fit, as thou,
589    To serue, and to deserue my Mistris grace,
590    And that my sword vpon thee shall approue,
591    And plead my passions for {Lauinia's} loue.
592   *<S {Aron}.> Clubs, clubs, these louers will not keep the peace.
593    <S {Dem}.> Why Boy, although our mother (vnaduised)
594    Gaue you a daunsing Rapier by your side,
595    Are you so desperate growne to threat your friends?
596    Goe #too: haue your Lath glued within your sheath,
597    Till you know better how to handle it.
598    <S {Chi}.> Meane while sir, with the little skill I haue,
599    Full well shalt thou perceiue how much I dare.
600    <S {Deme}.> #I Boy, grow ye so braue?  <D {They drawe}.>
601    <S {Aron}.> Why how now Lords?
602    So nere the Emperours Pallace dare you draw,
      <P cc6v>
603    And maintaine such a quarrell openly?
604    Full well I wote, the ground of all this grudge.
605    I would not for a million of Gold,
606    The cause were knowne to them it most concernes.
607    Nor would your noble mother for much more
608    Be so dishonored in the Court of Rome:
609    For shame put vp.
610    <S {Deme}.> Not I, till I haue sheath'd
611    My rapier in his bosome, and withall
612    Thrust these reprochfull speeches downe his throat,
613    That he hath breath'd in my dishonour heere.
614    <S {Chi}.> For that I am prepar'd, and full resolu'd,
615    Foule spoken Coward,
616    That thundrest with thy tongue,
617    And with thy weapon nothing dar'st performe.
618    <S {Aron}.> A way I say.
619    Now by the Gods that warlike Gothes adore,
620    This pretty brabble will vndoo vs all:
621    Why Lords, and thinke you not how dangerous
622    It is to set vpon a Princes right?
623    What is {Lauinia} then become so loose,
624    Or {Bassianus} so degenerate,
625    That for her loue such quarrels may be broacht,
626    Without controulement, Iustice, or reuenge?
627    Young Lords beware, #and should the Empresse know,
628    This discord ground, the musicke would not please.
629    <S {Chi}.> I care not I, knew she and all the world,
630    I loue {Lauinia} more then all the world.
631    <S {Demet}.> Youngling,
632    Learne thou to make some meaner choise,
633    {#Lauinia} is thine elder brothers hope.
634   *<S {Aron}.> Why are ye mad? Or know ye not in Rome,
635    How furious and impatient they be,
636    And cannot brooke Competitors in loue?
637    I tell you Lords, you doe but plot your deaths,
638    By this deuise.
639    <S {Chi}.> {Aaron}, a thousand deaths would I propose,
640    To atchieue her whom I do loue.
641    <S {Aron}.> To atcheiue her, how?
642    <S {Deme}.> Why, mak'st thou it so strange?
643    Shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd,
644    Shee is a woman, therfore may be wonne,
645    Shee is {Lauinia} therefore must be lou'd.
646    What man, more water glideth by the Mill
647    Then wots the Miller of, and easie it is
648    Of a cut loafe to steale a shiue we know:
649    Though {Bassianus} be the Emperours brother,
650    Better then he haue worne {Vulcans} badge.
651    <S {Aron}.> #I, and as good as {Saturninus} may.
652    <S {Deme}.> Then why should he dispaire that knowes to |(court it
653    With words, faire lookes, and liberality:
654    What hast not thou full often strucke a #Doe,
655    And borne her cleanly by the Keepers nose?
656   *<S {Aron}.> Why then it seemes some certaine snatch or so
657    Would serue your turnes.
658    <S {Chi}.> #I so the turne were serued.
659    <S {Deme}.> {Aaron} thou hast hit it.
660    <S {Aron}.> Would you had hit it too,
661    Then should not we be tir'd with this adoo:
662    Why harke yee, harke yee, and are you such fooles,
663    To square for this? Would it offend you then?
664    <S {Chi}.> Faith not me.
665    <S {Deme}.> Nor me, so I were one.
666   *<S {Aron}.> For shame be friends, & ioyne for that you iar:
667    'Tis pollicie, and stratageme must doe
668    That you affect, and so must you resolue,
669    That what you cannot as you would atcheiue,
670    You must perforce accomplish as you may:
671    Take this of me, {Lucrece} was not more chast
672    Then this {Lauinia}, {Bassianus} loue,
673    A speedier course this lingring languishment
674    Must we pursue, and I haue found the path:
675    My Lords, a solemne hunting is in hand.
676    There will the louely Roman Ladies troope:
677    The Forrest walkes are wide and spacious,
678    And many vnfrequented plots there are,
679    Fitted by kinde for rape and villanie:
680    Single you thither then this dainty #Doe,
681    And strike her home by force, if not by words:
682    This way or not at all, stand you in hope.
683    Come, come, our Empresse with her sacred wit
684    To villainie and vengance consecrate,
685    Will we acquaint with all that we intend,
686    And she shall file our engines with aduise,
687    That will not suffer you to square your selues,
688    But to your wishes height aduance you both.
689    The Emperours Court is like the house of Fame,
690    The pallace full of tongues, of eyes, of eares:
691    The Woods are ruthlesse, dreadfull, deafe, and dull:
692   *There speake, and strike braue Boyes, & take your turnes.
693    There serue your lusts, shadow'd from heauens eye,
694    And reuell in {Lauinia's} Treasurie.
695    <S {Chi}.> Thy counsell Lad smells of no cowardise.
696    <S {Deme}.> {Sit fas aut nefas}, till I finde the streames,
697    To coole this heat, a Charme to calme their fits,
698    {Per Stigia per manes Vehor}.  <D {Exeunt}.>
699   *<D {Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sonnes, making a noyse}
700    {with hounds and hornes, and Marcus}.>
701    <S {Tit}.> The hunt is vp, the morne is bright and gray,
702    The fields are fragrant, and the Woods are greene,
703    Vncouple heere, and let vs make a bay,
704    And wake the Emperour, and his louely Bride,
705    And rouze the Prince, and ring a hunters peale,
706    That all the Court may eccho with the noyse.
707    Sonnes let it be your charge, as it is ours,
708    To attend the Emperours person carefully:
709    I haue bene troubled in my sleepe this night,
710    But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.
711    <D {Winde Hornes}.>
712    <D {Heere a cry of houndes, and winde hornes in a peale, then}
713    {Enter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lauinia, Chiron, De-metrius},
714    {and their Attendants}.>
715    <S {Ti}.> Many good morrowes to your Maiestie,
716    Madam to you as many and as good.
717    I promised your Grace, a Hunters peale.
718    <S {Satur}.> And you haue rung it lustily my Lords,
719    Somewhat #to earely for new married Ladies.
720    <S {Bass}.> {Lauinia}, how say you?
721    <S {Laui}.> I say no:
722    I haue bene awake two houres and more.
723   *<S {Satur}.> Come on then, horse and Chariots let vs haue,
724    And to our sport: Madam, now shall ye see,
725    Our Romaine hunting.
726    <S {Mar}.> I haue dogges my Lord,
727    Will rouze the proudest Panther in the Chase,
728    And clime the highest Promontary top.
729    <S {Tit}.> And I haue horse will follow where the game
730    Makes way, and runnes likes Swallowes ore the plaine
      <P dd1>
731   *<S {Deme}.> {Chiron} we hunt not we, with Horse nor Hound
732    But hope to plucke a dainty #Doe to ground.  <D {Exeunt}>
733    <D {Enter Aaron alone}.>
734   *<S {Aron}.> He that had wit, would thinke that I had none,
735    To bury so much Gold vnder a Tree,
736    And neuer after to inherit it.
737    Let him that thinks of me so abiectly,
738    Know that this Gold must coine a Stratageme,
739    Which cunningly effected, will beget
740    A very excellent peece of villany;
741    And so repose sweet Gold for their vnrest,
742    That haue their Almes out of the Empresse Chest.
743    <D {Enter Tamora to the Moore}.>
744    <S {Tamo}.> My louely {Aaron},
745    Wherefore look'st thou sad,
746    When euery thing doth make a Gleefull boast?
747    The Birds chaunt melody on euery bush,
748    The Snake lies rolled in the chearefull Sunne,
749    The greene leaues quiuer, with the cooling winde,
750    And make a cheker'd shadow on the ground:
751    Vnder their sweete shade, {Aaron} let vs sit,
752    And whil'st the babling Eccho mock's the Hounds,
753    Replying shrilly to the well tun'd- Hornes,
754    As if a double hunt were heard at once,
755    Let vs sit downe, and marke their yelping noyse:
756    And after conflict, such as was suppos'd.
757    The wandring Prince and {Dido} once enioy'd,
758    When with a happy storme they were surpris'd,
759    And Curtain'd with a Counsaile- keeping Caue,
760    We may each wreathed in the others armes,
761    (Our pastimes done) possesse a Golden slumber,
762   *Whiles Hounds and Hornes, and sweet Melodious Birds
763    Be vnto vs, as is a Nurses Song
764    Of Lullabie, to bring her Babe asleepe.
765    <S {Aron}.> Madame,
766    Though {Venus} gouerne your desires,
767    Saturne is Dominator ouer mine:
768    What signifies my deadly standing eye,
769    My silence, and my Cloudy Melancholie,
770    My fleece of Woolly haire, that now vncurles,
771    Euen as an Adder when she doth vnrowle
772    To do some fatall execution?
773    No Madam, these are no Veneriall signes,
774    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
775    Blood, and reuenge, are Hammering in my head.
776    Harke {Tamora}, the Empresse of my Soule,
777    Which neuer hopes more heauen, then rests in thee,
778    This is the day of Doome for {Bassianus};
779    His {Philomel} must loose her tongue to day,
780    Thy Sonnes make Pillage of her Chastity,
781    And wash their hands in {Bassianus} blood.
782    Seest thou this Letter, take it vp I pray thee,
783    And giue the King this fatall plotted Scrowle,
784    Now question me no more, we are espied,
785    Heere comes a parcell of our hopefull Booty,
786    Which dreads not yet their liues destruction.
787    <D {Enter Bassianus and Lauinia}.>
788    <S {Tamo}.> Ah my sweet {Moore}:
789    Sweeter to me then life.
790    <S {Aron}.> No more great Empresse, {Bassianus} comes,
791    Be crosse with him, and Ile goe fetch thy Sonnes
792    To backe thy quarrell what so ere they be.
793    <S {Bassi}.> Whom haue we heere?
794    Romes Royall Empresse,
795    Vnfurnisht of our well beseeming troope?
796    Or is it {Dian} habited like her,
797    Who hath abandoned her holy Groues,
798    To see the generall Hunting in this Forrest?
799    <S {Tamo}.> Sawcie controuler of our priuate steps:
800    Had I the power, that some say {Dian} had,
801    Thy Temples should be planted presently.
802    With Hornes, as was {Acteons}, and the Hounds
803    Should driue vpon his new transformed limbes,
804    Vnmannerly Intruder as thou art.
805    <S {Laui}.> Vnder your patience gentle Empresse,
806    'Tis thought you haue a goodly gift in Horning,
807    And to be doubted, that your {Moore} and you
808    Are singled forth to try experiments:
809    {Ioue} sheild your husband from his Hounds to day,
810    'Tis pitty they should take him for a Stag.
811    <S {Bassi}.> Beleeue me Queene, your swarth Cymerion,
812    Doth make your Honour of his bodies Hue,
813    Spotted, detested, and abhominable.
814    Why are you sequestred from all your traine?
815    Dismounted from your Snow- white goodly Steed,
816    And wandred hither to an obscure plot,
817    Accompanied with a barbarous {Moore},
818    If foule desire had not conducted you?
819    <S {Laui}.> And being intercepted in your sport,
820    Great reason that my Noble Lord, be rated
821    For Saucinesse, I pray you let vs hence,
822    And let her ioy her Rauen coloured loue,
823    This valley fits the purpose passing well.
824   *<S {Bassi}.> The King my Brother shall haue notice of this.
825    <S {Laui}.> #I, for these slips haue made him noted long,
826    Good King, to be so mightily abused.
827    <S {Tamora}.> Why I haue patience to endure all this?
828    <D {Enter Chiron and Demetrius}.>
829    <S {Dem}.> How now deere Soueraigne
830    And our gracious Mother,
831    Why doth your Highnes looke so pale and wan?
832    <S {Tamo}.> Haue I not reason thinke you to looke pale.
833    These two haue tic'd me hither to this place,
834    A barren, detested vale you see it is.
835    The Trees though Sommer, yet forlorne and leane,
836    Ore- come with Mosse, and balefull Misselto.
837    Heere neuer shines the Sunne, heere nothing breeds,
838    Vnlesse the nightly Owle, or fatall Rauen:
839    And when they shew'd me this abhorred pit,
840    They told me heere at dead time of the night,
841    A thousand Fiends, a thousand hissing Snakes,
842    Ten thousand swelling Toades, as many Vrchins,
843    Would make such fearefull and confused cries,
844    As any mortall body hearing it,
845    Should straite fall mad, or else die suddenly.
846    No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
847    But strait they told me they would binde me heere,
848    Vnto the body of a dismall yew,
849    And leaue me to this miserable death.
850    And then they call'd me foule Adulteresse,
851    Lasciuious Goth, and all the bitterest tearmes
852    That euer eare did heare to such effect.
853    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
854    This vengeance on me had they executed:
855    Reuenge it, as you loue your Mothers life,
856    Or be ye not henceforth cal'd my Children.
857   *<S {Dem}.> This is a witnesse that I am thy Sonne.  <D {stab him}.>
858    <S {Chi}.> And this for me,
859    Strook home to shew my strength.
860    <S {Laui}.> I come {Semeramis}, nay Barbarous {Tamora}.
      <P dd1v>
861    For no name fits thy nature but thy owne.
862   *<S {Tam}.> Giue me thy poyniard, you shal know my boyes
863    Your Mothers hand shall right your Mothers wrong.
864    <S {Deme}.> Stay Madam heere is more belongs to her,
865    First thrash the Corne, then after burne the straw:
866    This Minion stood vpon her chastity,
867    Vpon her Nuptiall vow, her loyaltie.
868    And with that painted hope, braues your Mightinesse,
869    And shall she carry this vnto her graue?
870    <S {Chi}.> #And if she doe,
871    I would I were an Eunuch,
872    Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
873    And make his dead Trunke- Pillow to our lust.
874    <S {Tamo}.> But when ye haue the hony we desire,
875    Let not this Waspe out- liue vs both to sting.
876    <S {Chir}.> I warrant you Madam we will make that sure:
877    Come Mistris, now perforce we will enioy,
878    That nice- preserued honesty of yours.
879    <S {Laui}.> Oh {Tamora}, thou bear'st a woman face.
880    <S {Tamo}.> I will not heare her speake, away with her.
881    <S {Laui}.> Sweet Lords intreat her heare me but a word.
882    <S {Demet}.> Listen faire Madam, let it be your glory
883    To see her teares, but be your hart to them,
884    As vnrelenting flint to drops of raine.
885   *<S {Laui}.> When did the Tigers young- ones teach the dam?
886    O doe not learne her wrath, she taught it thee,
887    The milke thou suck'st from her did turne to Marble,
888    Euen at thy Teat thou had'st thy Tyranny,
889    Yet euery Mother breeds not Sonnes alike,
890    Do thou intreat her shew a woman pitty.
891    <S {Chiro}.> What,
892    Would'st thou haue me proue my selfe a bastard?
893    <S {Laui}.> 'Tis true,
894    The Rauen doth not hatch a Larke,
895    Yet haue I heard, Oh could I finde it now,
896    The Lion mou'd with pitty, did indure
897    To haue his Princely pawes par'd all away.
898    Some say, that Rauens foster forlorne children,
899    The whil'st their owne birds famish in their nests:
900    Oh be to me though thy hard hart say no,
901    Nothing so kind but something pittifull.
902    <S {Tamo}.> I know not what it meanes, away with her.
903    <S {Lauin}.> Oh let me teach thee for my Fathers sake,
904    That gaue thee life when well he might haue slaine thee:
905    Be not obdurate, open thy deafe eares.
906    <S {Tamo}.> Had'st thou in person nere offended me.
907    Euen for his sake am I pittilesse:
908    Remember Boyes I powr'd forth teares in vaine,
909    To saue your brother from the sacrifice,
910    But fierce {Andronicus} would not relent,
911    Therefore away with her, and vse her as you will,
912    The worse to her, the better lou'd of me.
913    <S {Laui}.> Oh {Tamora},
914    Be call'd a gentle Queene,
915    And with thine owne hands kill me in this place,
916    For 'tis not life that I haue beg'd so long,
917    Poore I was slaine, when {Bassianus} dy'd.
918   *<S {Tam}.> What beg'st thou then? fond woman let me go?
919    <S {Laui}.> 'Tis present death I beg, and one thing more,
920    That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
921    Oh keepe me from their worse then killing lust,
922    And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
923    Where neuer mans eye may behold my body,
924    Doe this, and be a charitable murderer.
925    <S {Tam}.> So should I rob my sweet Sonnes of their fee,
926    No let them satisfie their lust on thee.
927    <S {Deme}.> Away,
928    For thou hast staid vs heere too long.
929    <S {Lauinia}.> No Grace,
930    No womanhood? Ah beastly creature,
931    The blot and enemy to our generall name,
932    Confusion fall===
933    <S {Chi}.> Nay then Ile stop your mouth
934    Bring thou her husband,
935    This is the Hole where {Aaron} bid vs hide him.
936   *<S {Tam}.> Farewell my Sonnes, see that you make her sure,
937    Nere let my heart know merry cheere indeed,
938    Till all the {Andronici} be made away:
939    Now will I hence to seeke my louely {Moore},
940    And let my spleenefull Sonnes this Trull defloure.  <D {Exit}.>
941    <D {Enter Aaron with two of Titus Sonnes}.>
942    <S {Aron}.> Come on my Lords, the better foote before,
943    Straight will I bring you to the lothsome pit,
944    Where I espied the Panther fast asleepe.
945    <S {Quin}.> My sight is very dull what ere it bodes.
946   *<S {Marti}.> And mine I promise you, were it not for shame,
947    Well could I leaue our sport to sleepe #a while.
948    <S {Quin}.> What art thou fallen?
949    What subtile Hole is this,
950    Whose mouth is couered with Rude growing Briers,
951    Vpon whose leaues are drops of new- shed- blood,
952    As fresh as mornings dew distil'd on flowers,
953    A very fatall place it seemes to me:
954    Speake Brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
955    <S {Martius}.> Oh Brother,
956    With the dismal'st obiect
957    That euer eye with sight made heart lament.
958   *<S {Aron}.> Now will I fetch the King to finde them heere,
959    That he thereby may haue a likely gesse,
960    How these were they that made away his Brother.
961    <D {Exit Aaron}.>
962   *<S {Marti}.> Why dost not comfort me and helpe me out,
963    From this vnhallow'd and blood- stained Hole?
964    <S {Quintus}.> I am surprised with an vncouth feare,
965    A chilling sweat ore- runs my trembling ioynts,
966    My heart suspects more then mine eie can see.
967    <S {Marti}.> To proue thou hast a true diuining heart,
968    <S {Aaron}> and thou looke downe into this den,
969    And see a fearefull sight of blood and death.
970    <S {Quintus}.> {Aaron} is gone,
971    And my compassionate heart
972    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
973    The thing whereat it trembles by surmise:
974    Oh tell me how it is, for nere till now
975    Was I a child to feare I know not what.
976    <S {Marti}.> Lord {Bassianus} lies embrewed heere,
977    All on a heape like to the slaughtred Lambe,
978    In this detested, darke, blood- drinking pit.
979    <S {Quin}.> If it be darke, how doost thou know 'tis he?
980    <S {Mart}.> Vpon his bloody finger he doth weare
981    A precious Ring, that lightens all the Hole:
982    Which like a Taper in some Monument,
983    Doth shine vpon the dead mans earthly cheekes,
984    And shewes the ragged intrailes of the pit:
985    So pale did shine the Moone on {Piramus},
986    When he by night lay bath'd in Maiden blood:
987    O Brother helpe me with thy fainting hand.
988    If feare hath made thee faint, as mee it hath,
989    Out of this fell deuouring receptacle,
990    As hatefull as {Ocitus} mistie mouth.
991   *<S {Quint}.> Reach me thy hand, that I may helpe thee out,
      <P dd2>
992    Or wanting strength to doe thee so much good,
993    I may be pluckt into the swallowing wombe,
994    Of this deepe pit, poore {Bassianus} graue:
995    I haue no strength to plucke thee to the brinke.
996   *<S {Martius}.> Nor I no strength to clime without thy help.
997    <S {Quin}.> Thy hand once more, I will not loose againe,
998    Till thou art heere aloft, or I below,
999    Thou can'st not come to me, I come to thee.  <D {Both fall in}.>
1000   <D {Enter the Emperour, Aaron the Moore}.>
1001   <S {Satur}.> Along with me, Ile see what hole is heere,
1002   And what he is that now is leapt into it.
1003   Say, who art thou that lately did'st descend,
1004   Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
1005   <S {Marti}.> The vnhappie sonne of old {Andronicus,}
1006   Brought hither in a most vnluckie houre,
1007   To finde thy brother {Bassianus} dead.
1008   <S {Satur}.> My brother dead? I know thou dost but iest,
1009   He and his Lady both are at the Lodge,
1010   Vpon the North- side of this pleasant Chase,
1011   'Tis not an houre since I left him there.
1012   <S {Marti}.> We know not where you left him all aliue,
1013   But out alas, heere haue we found him dead.
1014   <D {Enter Tamora, Andronicus, and Lucius}.>
1015   <S {Tamo}.> Where is my Lord the King?
1016  *<S {King}.> Heere {Tamora}, though grieu'd with killing griefe.
1017   <S {Tam}.> Where is thy brother {Bassianus}?
1018  *<S {King}.> Now to the bottome dost thou search my wound,
1019   Poore {Bassianus} heere lies murthered.
1020   <S {Tam}.> Then all too late I bring this fatall writ,
1021   The complot of this timelesse Tragedie,
1022   And wonder greatly that mans face can fold,
1023   In pleasing smiles such murderous Tyrannie.
1024   <D {She giueth Saturnine a Letter}.>
1025   <S {Saturninus reads the Letter}.>
1026   {#And if we misse to meete him hansomely},
1027   {Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we meane},
1028   {Doe thou so much as dig the graue for him},
1029   {Thou know'st our meaning, looke for thy reward}
1030   {Among the Nettles at the Elder tree}:
1031   {Which ouer- shades the mouth of that same pit}:
1032   {Where we decreed to bury Bassianuss}
1033   {Doe this and purchase vs thy lasting friends}.
1034   <S {King}.> Oh {Tamora}, was euer heard the like?
1035   This is the pit, and this the Elder tree,
1036   Looke sirs, if you can finde the huntsman out,
1037   That should haue murthered {Bassianus} heere.
1038   <S {Aron}.> My gracious Lord heere is the bag of Gold.
1039   <S {King}.> Two of thy whelpes, fell Curs of bloody kind
1040   Haue heere bereft my brother of his life:
1041   Sirs drag them from the pit vnto the prison,
1042   There let them bide vntill we haue deuis'd
1043   Some neuer heard- of tortering paine for them.
1044   <S {Tamo}.> What are they in this pit,
1045   Oh wondrous thing!
1046   How easily murder is discouered?
1047   <S {Tit}.> High Emperour, vpon my feeble knee,
1048   I beg this boone, with teares, not lightly shed,
1049   That this fell fault of my accursed Sonnes,
1050   Accursed, if the faults be prou'd in them.
1051   <S {King}.> If it be prou'd? you see it is apparant,
1052   Who found this Letter, {Tamora} was it you?
1053   <S {Tamora}.> {Andronicus} himselfe did take it vp.
1054   <S {Tit}.> I did my Lord,
1055   Yet let me be their baile,
1056   For by my Fathers reuerent Tombe I vow
1057   They shall be ready at your Highnes #will,
1058   To answere their suspition with their liues.
1059  *<S {King}.> Thou shalt not baile them, see thou follow me:
1060   Some bring the murthered body, some the murtherers,
1061   Let them not speake a word, the guilt is plaine,
1062   For by my soule, were there worse end then death,
1063   That end vpon them should be executed.
1064   <S {Tamo}.> {Andronicus} I will entreat the King,
1065   Feare not thy Sonnes, they shall do well enough.
1066   <S {Tit}.> Come {Lucius} come,
1067   Stay not to talke with them.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1068  *<D {Enter the Empresse Sonnes, with Lauinia, her hands cut off and}
1069   {her tongue cut out, and rauisht}.>
1070  *<S {Deme}.> So now goe tell #and if thy tongue can speake,
1071   Who t'was that cut thy tongue and rauisht thee.
1072  *<S {Chi}.> Write downe thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
1073   #And if thy stumpes will let thee play the Scribe.
1074  *<S {Dem}.> See how with signes and tokens she can scowle.
1075   <S {Chi}.> Goe home,
1076   Call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
1077  *<S {Dem}.> She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash.
1078   And so let's leaue her to her silent walkes.
1079  *<S {Chi}.> #And t'were my cause, I should goe hang my selfe.
1080  *<S {Dem}.> If thou had'st hands to helpe thee knit the cord.
1081   <D {Exeunt}.>
1082   <D {Winde Hornes}.>
1083   <D {Enter Marcus from hunting, to Lauinia}.>
1084   Who is this, my Neece that flies away so fast?
1085   Cosen a word, where is your husband?
1086   If I do dreame, would all my wealth would wake me;
1087   If I doe wake, some Planet strike me downe,
1088   That I may slumber in eternall sleepe.
1089   Speake gentle Neece, what sterne vngentle hands
1090   Hath lopt, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
1091   Of her two branches, those sweet Ornaments
1092  *Whose circkling shadowes, Kings haue sought to sleep in
1093   And might not gaine so great a happines
1094   As halfe thy Loue: Why doost not speake to me?
1095   Alas, a Crimson riuer of warme blood,
1096   Like to a bubling fountaine stir'd with winde,
1097   Doth rise and fall betweene thy Rosed lips,
1098   Comming and going with thy hony breath.
1099   But sure some {Tereus} hath defloured thee,
1100   And least thou should'st detect them, cut thy tongue.
1101   Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame:
1102   And notwithstanding all this losse of blood,
1103   As from a Conduit with their issuing Spouts,
1104   Yet doe thy cheekes looke red as {Titans} face,
1105   Blushing to be encountred with a Cloud,
1106   Shall I speake for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
1107   Oh that I knew thy hart, and knew the beast
1108   That I might raile at him to ease my mind.
1109   Sorrow concealed, like an Ouen stopt.
1110   Doth burne the hart to Cinders where it is.
1111   Faire {Philomela} she but lost her tongue,
1112   And in a tedious Sampler sowed her minde.
1113   But louely Neece, that meane is cut from thee,
1114   A craftier {Tereus} hast thou met withall,
1115   And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
      <P dd2v>
1116   That could haue better sowed then {Philomel}.
1117   Oh had the monster seene those Lilly hands,
1118   Tremble like Aspen leaues vpon a Lute,
1119   And make the silken strings delight to kisse them,
1120   He would not then haue toucht them for his life.
1121   Or had he heard the heauenly Harmony,
1122   Which that sweet tongue hath made:
1123   He would haue dropt his knife and fell asleepe,
1124   As {Cerberus} at the Thracian Poets feete.
1125   Come, let vs goe, and make thy father blinde,
1126   For such a sight will blinde a fathers eye.
1127   One houres storme will drowne the fragrant meades,
1128   What, will whole months of teares thy Fathers eyes?
1129   Doe not draw backe, for we will mourne with thee:
1130   Oh could our mourning ease thy misery.  <D {Exeunt}>

1134   {before pleading}.>
1135   <S {Ti}.> Heare me graue fathers, noble Tribunes stay,
1136   For pitty of mine age, whose youth was spent
1137   In dangerous warres, whilst you securely slept:
1138   For all my blood in Romes great quarrell shed,
1139   For all the frosty nights that I haue watcht,
1140   And for these bitter teares, which now you see,
1141   Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheekes,
1142   Be pittifull to my condemned Sonnes,
1143   Whose soules is not corrupted as 'tis thought:
1144   For two and twenty sonnes I neuer wept,
1145   Because they died in honours lofty bed.
1146   {#Andronicus lyeth downe, and the Iudges passe by him}.
1147   For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
1148   My harts deepe languor, and my soules sad teares:
1149   Let my teares stanch the earths drie appetite.
1150   My sonnes sweet blood, will make it shame and blush:
1151   O earth! I will be friend thee more with raine  <D {Exeunt}>
1152   That shall distill from these two ancient ruines,
1153   Then youthfull Aprill shall with all his showres
1154   In summers drought: Ile drop vpon thee still,
1155   In Winter with warme teares Ile melt the snow,
1156   And keepe eternall spring time on thy face,
1157   So thou refuse to drinke my deare sonnes blood.
1158   <D {Enter Lucius, with his weapon drawne}.>
1159   Oh reuerent Tribunes, oh gentle aged men,
1160   Vnbinde my sonnes, reuerse the doome of death,
1161   And let me say (that neuer wept before)
1162   My teares are now preualing Oratours.
1163   <S {Lu}.> Oh noble father, you lament in vaine,
1164   The Tribunes heare not, no man is by,
1165   And you recount your sorrowes to a stone.
1166   <S {Ti}.> Ah {Lucius} for thy brothers let me plead,
1167   Graue Tribunes, once more I intreat of you.
1168  *<S {Lu}.> My gracious Lord, no Tribune heares you speake.
1169   <S {Ti}.> Why 'tis no matter man, if they did heare
1170   They would not marke me: oh if they did heare
1171   They would not pitty me.
1172   Therefore I tell my sorrowes bootles to the stones.
1173   Who though they cannot answere my distresse,
1174   Yet in some sort they are better then the Tribunes,
1175   For that they will not intercept my tale;
1176   When I doe weepe, they humbly at my feete
1177   Receiue my teares, and seeme to weepe with me,
1178   And were they but attired in graue weedes,
1179   Rome could afford no Tribune like to these.
1180   A stone is as soft waxe,
1181   Tribunes more hard then stones:
1182   A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
1183   And Tribunes with their tongues doome men to death.
1184   But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawne?
1185   <S {Lu}.> To rescue my two brothers from their death,
1186   For which attempt the Iudges haue pronounc'st
1187   My euerlasting doome of banishment.
1188   <S {Ti}.> O happy man, they haue befriended thee:
1189   Why foolish {Lucius}, dost thou not perceiue
1190   That Rome is but a wildernes of Tigers?
1191   Tigers must pray, and Rome affords no prey
1192   But me and mine: how happy art thou then,
1193   From these deuourers to be banished?
1194   But who comes with our brother {Marcus} heere?
1195   <D {Enter Marcus and Lauinia}.>
1196   <S {Mar}.> {Titus}, prepare thy noble eyes to weepe,
1197   Or if not so, thy noble heart to breake:
1198   I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
1199   <S {Ti}.> Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
1200   <S {Mar}.> This was thy daughter.
1201   <S {Ti}.> Why {Marcus} so she is.
1202   <S {Luc}.> Aye me this obiect kils me.
1203   <S {Ti}.> Faint- harted boy, arise and looke vpon her,
1204   Speake {Lauinia}, what accursed hand
1205   Hath made thee handlesse in thy Fathers sight?
1206   What foole hath added water to the Sea?
1207   Or brought a faggot to bright burning Troy?
1208   My griefe was at the height before thou cam'st,
1209   And now like {Nylus} it disdaineth bounds:
1210   Giue me a sword, Ile chop off my hands too,
1211   For they haue fought for Rome, and all in vaine:
1212   And they haue nur'st this woe,
1213   In feeding life:
1214   In bootelesse prayer haue they bene held vp,
1215   And they haue seru'd me to effectlesse vse.
1216   Now all the seruice I require of them,
1217   Is that the one will helpe to cut the other:
1218   'Tis well {Lauinia}, that thou hast no hands,
1219   For hands to do Rome seruice, is but vaine.
1220   <S {Luci}.> Speake gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
1221   <S {Mar}.> O that delightfull engine of her thoughts,
1222   That blab'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
1223   Is torne from forth that pretty hollow cage,
1224   Where like a sweet mellodius bird it sung,
1225   Sweet varied notes inchanting euery eare.
1226   <S {Luci}.> Oh say thou for her,
1227   Who hath done this deed?
1228   <S {Marc}.> Oh thus I found her straying in the Parke,
1229   Seeking to hide herselfe as doth the Deare
1230   That hath receiude some vnrecuring wound.
1231   <S {Tit}.> It was my Deare,
1232   And he that wounded her,
1233   Hath hurt me more, then had he kild me dead:
1234   For now I stand as one vpon a Rocke,
1235   Inuiron'd with a wildernesse of Sea.
1236   Who markes the waxing tide,
1237   Grow waue by waue,
      <P dd3>
1238   Expecting euer when some enuious surge,
1239   Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
1240   This way to death my wretched sonnes are gone:
1241   Heere stands my other sonne, a banisht man,
1242   And heere my brother weeping at my woes.
1243   But that which giues my soule the greatest spurne,
1244   Is deere {Lauinia}, deerer then my soule.
1245   Had I but seene thy picture in this plight,
1246   It would haue madded me. What shall I doe?
1247   Now I behold thy liuely body so?
1248   Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy teares,
1249   Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
1250   Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
1251   Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
1252   Looke {Marcus}, ah sonne {Lucius} looke on her:
1253   When I did name her brothers, then fresh teares
1254   Stood on her cheekes, as doth the hony dew,
1255   Vpon a gathred Lillie almost withered.
1256   <S {Mar}.> Perchance she weepes because they kil'd her
1257   husband,
1258   Perchance because she knowes him innocent.
1259   <S {Ti}.> If they did kill thy husband then be ioyfull,
1260   Because the law hath tane reuenge on them.
1261   No, no, they would not doe so foule a deede,
1262   Witnes the sorrow that their sister makes.
1263   Gentle {Lauinia} let me kisse thy lips,
1264   Or make some signes how I may do thee ease:
1265   Shall thy good Vncle, and thy brother {Lucius},
1266   And thou and I sit round about some Fountaine,
1267   Looking all downewards to behold our cheekes
1268   How they are stain'd in meadowes, yet not dry
1269   With miery slime left on them by a flood:
1270   And in the Fountaine shall we gaze so long,
1271   Till the fresh taste be taken from that cleerenes,
1272   And made a brine pit with our bitter teares?
1273   Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
1274   Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumbe shewes
1275   Passe the remainder of our hatefull dayes?
1276   What shall we doe? Let vs that haue our tongues
1277   Plot some deuise of further miseries
1278   To make vs wondred at in time to come.
1279  *<S {Lu}.> Sweet Father cease your teares, for at your griefe
1280   See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
1281   <S {Mar}.> Patience deere Neece, good {Titus} drie thine
1282   eyes.
1283   <S {Ti}.> Ah {Marcus}, {Marcus}, Brother well I wot,
1284   Thy napkin cannot drinke a teare of mine,
1285   For thou poore man hast drown'd it with thine owne.
1286   <S {Lu}.> Ah my {Lauinia} I will wipe thy cheekes.
1287   <S {Ti}.> Marke {Marcus} marke, I vnderstand her signes,
1288   Had she a tongue to speake, now would she say
1289   That to her brother which I said to thee.
1290   His Napkin with her true teares all bewet,
1291   Can do no seruice on her sorrowfull cheekes.
1292   Oh what a simpathy of woe is this!
1293   As farre from helpe as Limbo is from blisse,
1294   <D {Enter Aron the Moore alone}.>
1295   <S {Moore}.> {Titus Andronicus}, my Lord the Emperour,
1296   Sends thee this word, that if thou loue thy sonnes,
1297   Let {Marcus}, {Lucius}, or thy selfe old {Titus},
1298   Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
1299   And send it to the King: he for the same,
1300   Will send thee hither both thy sonnes aliue,
1301   And that shall be the ransome for their fault.
1302   <S {Ti}.> Oh gracious Emperour, oh gentle {Aaron}.
1303   Did euer Rauen sing so like a Larke,
1304   That giues sweet tydings of the Sunnes vprise?
1305   With all my heart, Ile send the Emperour my hand,
1306   Good {Aron} wilt thou help to chop it off?
1307   <S {Lu}.> Stay Father, for that noble hand of thine,
1308   That hath throwne downe so many enemies,
1309   Shall not be sent: my hand will serue the turne,
1310   My youth can better spare my blood then you,
1311   And therfore mine shall saue my brothers liues.
1312  *<S {Mar}.> Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
1313   And rear'd aloft the bloody Battleaxe,
1314   Writing destruction on the enemies Castle?
1315   Oh none of both but are of high desert:
1316   My hand hath bin but idle, let it serue
1317   To ransome my two nephewes from their death,
1318   Then haue I kept it to a worthy end.
1319   <S {Moore}.> Nay come agree, whose hand shall goe along
1320   For feare they die before their pardon come.
1321   <S {Mar}.> My hand shall goe.
1322   <S {Lu}.> By heauen it shall not goe.
1323  *<S {Ti}.> Sirs striue no more, such withered hearbs as these
1324   Are meete for plucking vp, and therefore mine.
1325   <S {Lu}.> Sweet Father, if I shall be thought thy sonne,
1326   Let me redeeme my brothers both from death.
1327   <S {Mar}.> And for our fathers sake, and mothers care,
1328   Now let me shew a brothers loue to thee.
1329   <S {Ti}.> Agree betweene you, I will spare my hand.
1330   <S {Lu}.> Then Ile goe fetch an Axe.
1331   <S {Mar}.> But I will vse the Axe. <D {Exeunt}>
1332   <S {Ti}.> Come hither {Aaron}, Ile deceiue them both,
1333   Lend me thy hand, and I will giue thee mine,
1334   <S {Moore}.> If that be cal'd deceit, I will be honest,
1335   And neuer whil'st I liue deceiue men so:
1336   But Ile deceiue you in another sort,
1337   And that you'l say ere halfe an houre passe.
1338   <D {He cuts off Titus hand}.>
1339   <D {Enter Lucius and Marcus againe}.>
1340   <S {Ti}.> Now stay your strife, what shall be, is dispatcht:
1341   Good {Aron} giue his Maiestie my hand,
1342   Tell him, it was a hand that warded him
1343   From thousand dangers: bid him bury it:
1344   More hath it merited: That let it haue.
1345   As  for my sonnes, say I account of them,
1346   As iewels purchast at an easie price,
1347   And yet deere too, because I bought mine owne.
1348   <S {Aron}.> I goe {Andronicus}, and for thy hand,
1349   Looke #by and by to haue thy sonnes with thee:
1350   Their heads I meane: Oh how this villany
1351   Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it.
1352   Let fooles doe good, and faire men call for grace,
1353   {#Aron} will haue his soule blacke like his face.  <D {Exit}.>
1354   <S {Ti}.> O heere I lift this one hand vp to heauen,
1355   And bow this feeble ruine to the earth,
1356   If any power pitties wretched teares,
1357   To that I call: what wilt thou kneele with me?
1358  *Doe then deare heart, for heauen shall heare our prayers,
1359   Or with our sighs weele breath the welkin dimme,
1360   And staine the Sun with fogge as somtime cloudes,
1361   When they do hug him in their melting bosomes.
1362   <S {Mar}.> Oh brother speake with possibilities,
1363   And do not breake into these deepe extreames.
1364   <S {Ti}.> Is not my sorrow deepe, hauing no bottome?
      <P dd3v><C B>
1365   Then be my passions bottomlesse with them.
1366   <S {Mar}.> But yet let reason gouerne thy lament.
1367   <S {Titus}.> If there were reason for these miseries,
1368   Then into limits could I binde my woes:
1369  *When heauen doth weepe, doth not the earth oreflow?
1370   If the windes rage, doth not the Sea wax mad,
1371   Threatning the welkin with his big- swolne face?
1372   And wilt thou haue a reason for this coile?
1373   I am the Sea. Harke how her sighes doe flow:
1374   Shee is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
1375   Then must my Sea be moued with her sighes,
1376   Then must my earth with her continuall teares,
1377   Become a deluge: ouerflow'd and drown'd:
1378   For why, my bowels cannot hide her woes,
1379   But like a drunkard must I vomit them:
1380   Then giue me leaue, for loosers will haue leaue,
1381   To ease their stomackes with their bitter tongues,
1382   <D {Enter a messenger with two heads and a hand}.>
1383   <S {Mess}.> Worthy {Andronicus}, #ill art thou repaid,
1384   For that good hand thou sentst the Emperour:
1385   Heere are the heads of thy two noble sonnes.
1386   And heeres thy hand in scorne to thee sent backe:
1387   Thy griefes, their sports: Thy resolution mockt,
1388   That woe is me to thinke vpon thy woes,
1389   More then remembrance of my fathers death. <D {Exit}.>
1390   <S {Marc}.> Now let hot Aetna coole in Cicilie,
1391   And be my heart an euer- burning #hell:
1392   These miseries are more then may be borne.
1393   To weepe with them that weepe, doth ease some deale,
1394   But sorrow flouted at, is double death.
1395  *<S {Luci}.> Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound,
1396   And yet detested life not shrinke thereat:
1397   That euer death should let life beare his name,
1398   Where life hath no more interest but to breath.
1399   <S {Mar}.> Alas poore hart that kisse is comfortlesse,
1400   As frozen water to a starued snake.
1401  *<S {Titus}.> When will this fearefull slumber haue an end?
1402   <S {Mar}.> Now farwell flatterie, die {Andronicus},
1403   Thou dost not slumber, see thy two sons heads,
1404   Thy warlike hands, thy mangled daughter here:
1405   Thy other banisht sonnes with this deere sight
1406   Strucke pale and bloodlesse, and thy brother I,
1407   Euen like a stony Image, cold and numme.
1408   Ah now no more will I controule my griefes,
1409   Rent off thy siluer haire, thy other hand
1410   Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismall sight
1411   The closing vp of our most wretched eyes:
1412   Now is a time to storme, why art thou still?
1413   <S {Titus}.> Ha, ha, ha,
1414  *<S {Mar}.> Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this houre.
1415   <S {Ti}.> Why I haue not another teare to shed:
1416   Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
1417   And would vsurpe vpon my watry eyes,
1418   And make them blinde with tributarie teares.
1419   Then which way shall I finde Reuenges Caue?
1420   For these two heads doe seeme to speake to me,
1421   And threat me, I shall neuer come to blisse,
1422   Till all these mischiefes be returned againe,
1423   Euen in their throats that haue committed them.
1424   Come let me see what taske I haue to doe,
1425   You heauie people, circle me about,
1426   That I may turne me to each one of you,
1427   And sweare vnto my soule to right your wrongs.
1428   The vow is made, come Brother take a head,
1429   And in this hand the other will I beare.
1430   And {Lauinia} thou shalt be employd in these things:
1431   Beare thou my hand sweet wench betweene thy teeth:
1432   As for thee boy, goe get thee from my sight,
1433   Thou art an Exile, and thou must not stay,
1434   Hie to the {Gothes}, and raise an army there,
1435   And if you loue me, as I thinke you doe,
1436   Let's kisse and part, for we haue much to doe.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1437   <D {Manet Lucius}.>
1438   <S {Luci}.> Farewell {Andronicus} my noble Father:
1439   The woful'st man that euer liu'd in Rome:
1440   Farewell proud Rome, til {Lucius} come againe,
1441   He loues his pledges dearer then his life:
1442   Farewell {Lauinia} my noble sister,
1443   O would thou wert as thou to fore hast beene,
1444   But now, nor {Lucius} nor {Lauinia} liues
1445   But in obliuion and hateful griefes:
1446   If {Lucius} liue, he will requit your wrongs,
1447   And make proud {Saturnine} and his Empresse
1448   Beg at the gates like {Tarquin} and his Queene.
1449   Now will I to the Gothes and raise a power,
1450   To be reueng'd on Rome and {Saturnine}.  <D {Exit Lucius}>
1451   <D {A Banket}.>
1452   <D {Enter Andronicus, Marcus, Lauinia, and the Boy}.>
1453   <S {An}.> So, so, now sit, and looke you eate no more
1454   Then will preserue iust so much strength in vs
1455   As will reuenge these bitter woes of ours.
1456   {Marcus} vnknit that sorrow- wreathen knot:
1457   Thy Neece and I (poore Creatures) want our hands
1458   And cannot passionate our tenfold griefe,
1459   With foulded Armes. This poore right hand of mine,
1460   Is left to tirranize vppon my breast.
1461   Who when my hart all mad with misery,
1462   Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
1463   Then thus I thumpe it downe.
1464   Thou Map of woe, that thus dost talk in signes,
1465   When thy poore hart beates without ragious beating,
1466   Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still?
1467   Wound it with sighing girle, kil it with grones:
1468   Or get some little knife betweene thy teeth,
1469   And iust against thy hart make thou a hole,
1470   That all the teares that thy poore eyes let fall
1471   May run into that sinke, and soaking in,
1472   Drowne the lamenting foole, in Sea salt teares.
1473   <S {Mar}.> Fy brother fy, teach her not thus to lay
1474   Such violent hands vppon her tender life.
1475  *<S {An}.> How now! Has sorrow made thee doate already?
1476   Why {Marcus}, no man should be mad but I:
1477   What violent hands can she lay on her life:
1478   Ah, wherefore dost thou vrge the name of hands,
1479   To bid {Aeneas} tell the tale twice ore
1480   How Troy was burnt, and he made miserable?
1481   O handle not the theame, to talke of hands,
1482   Least we remember still that we haue none,
1483   Fie, fie, how Frantiquely I square my talke
1484   As if we should forget we had no hands:
1485   If {Marcus} did not name the word of hands.
1486   Come, lets fall #too, and gentle girle eate this,
1487   Heere is no drinke? Harke {Marcus} what she saies,
1488   I can interpret all her martir'd signes,
1489   She saies, she drinkes no other drinke but teares
1490   Breu'd with her sorrow: mesh'd vppon her cheekes,
      <P dd4><C E>
1491   Speechlesse complayner, I will learne thy thought:
1492   In thy dumb action, will I be as perfect
1493   As begging Hermits in their holy prayers.
1494   Thou shalt not sighe nor hold thy stumps to heauen,
1495   Nor winke, nor nod, nor kneele, nor make a signe;
1496   But I (of these) will wrest an Alphabet,
1497   And by still practice, learne to know thy meaning.
1498  *<S {Boy}.> Good grandsire leaue these bitter deepe laments,
1499   Make my Aunt merry, with some pleasing tale.
1500   <S {Mar}.> Alas, the tender boy in passion mou'd,
1501   Doth weepe to see his grandsires heauinesse.
1502   <S {An}.> Peace tender Sapling, thou art made of teares,
1503   And teares will quickly melt thy life away.
1504   <D {Marcus strikes the dish with a knife}.>
1505   What doest thou strike at {Marcus} with knife.
1506   <S {Mar}.> At that that I haue kil'd my Lord, a Fly
1507   <S {An}.> Out on the murderour: thou kil'st my hart,
1508   Mine eyes cloi'd with view of Tirranie:
1509   A deed of death done on the Innocent
1510   Becoms not {Titus} brother: get thee gone,
1511   I see thou art not for my company.
1512   <S {Mar}.> Alas (my Lord) I haue but kild a flie.
1513  *<S {An}.> But? How: if that Flie had a father and mother?
1514   How would he hang his slender gilded wings
1515   And buz lamenting doings in the ayer,
1516   Poore harmelesse Fly,
1517   That with his pretty buzing melody,
1518   Came heere to make vs merry,
1519   And thou hast kil'd him.
1520   <S {Mar}.> Pardon me sir,
1521   It was a blacke illfauour'd Fly,
1522   Like to the Empresse Moore, therefore I kild him.
1523   <S {An}.> O, o, o,
1524   Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
1525   For thou hast done a Charitable deed:
1526   Giue me thy knife, I will insult on him,
1527   Flattering my selfe, as if it were the Moore,
1528   Come hither purposely to poyson me.
1529   There's for thy selfe, and thats for {Tamora}: Ah sirra,
1530   Yet I thinke we are not brought so low,
1531   But that betweene vs, we can kill a Fly,
1532   That comes in likenesse of a Cole- blacke Moore.
1533  *<S {Mar}.> Alas poore man, griefe ha's so wrought on him,
1534   He takes false shadowes, for true substances.
1535   <S {An}.> Come, take away: {Lauinia}, goe with me,
1536   Ile to thy closset, and goe read with thee
1537   Sad stories, chanced in the times of old.
1538   Come boy, and goe with me, thy sight is young,
1539   And thou shalt read, when mine begin to dazell.  <D {Exeunt}>
1540   <Z {Actus Quartus}.>
1541   <D {Enter young Lucius and Lauinia running after him, and}
1542   {the Boy flies from her with his bookes vnder his arme}.
1543   {Enter Titus and Marcus}.>
1544   <S {Boy}.> Helpe Gransier helpe, my Aunt {Lauinia},
1545   Followes me euery where I know not why.
1546   Good Vncle {Marcus} see how swift she comes,
1547   Alas sweet Aunt, I know not what you meane.
1548   <S {Mar}.> Stand by me {Lucius}, doe not feare thy Aunt.
1549  *<S {Titus}.> She loues thee boy too well to doe thee harme
1550   <S {Boy}.> #I when my father was in Rome she did.
1551  *<S {Mar}.> What meanes my Neece {Lauinia} by these signes?
1552   <S {Ti}.> Feare not {Lucius}, somewhat doth she meane:
1553   See {Lucius} see, how much she makes of thee:
1554   Some whether would she haue thee goe with her.
1555   Ah boy, {Cornelia} neuer with more care
1556   Read to her sonnes, then she hath read to thee,
1557   Sweet Poetry, and Tullies Oratour:
1558   Canst thou not gesse wherefore she plies thee thus?
1559   <S {Boy}.> My Lord I know not I, nor can I gesse,
1560   Vnlesse some fit or frenzie do possesse her:
1561   For I haue heard my Gransier say full oft,
1562   Extremitie of griefes would make men mad.
1563   And I haue read that {Hecuba} of Troy,
1564   Ran mad through sorrow, that made me to feare,
1565   Although my Lord, I know my noble Aunt,
1566   Loues me as deare as ere my mother did,
1567   And would not but in fury fright my youth,
1568   Which made me downe to throw my bookes, and flie
1569   Causles perhaps, but pardon me sweet Aunt,
1570   And Madam, if my Vncle {Marcus} goe,
1571   I will most willingly attend your Ladyship.
1572   <S {Mar}.> {Lucius} I will.
1573   <S {Ti}.> How now {Lauinia}, {Marcus} what meanes this?
1574   Some booke there is that she desires to see,
1575   Which is it girle of these? Open them boy,
1576   But thou art deeper read and better skild,
1577   Come and take choyse of all my Library,
1578   And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heauens
1579   Reueale the damn'd contriuer of this deed.
1580   What booke?
1581   Why lifts she vp her armes in sequence thus?
1582  *<S {Mar}.> I thinke she meanes that ther was more then one
1583   Confederate in the fact, #I more there was:
1584   Or else to heauen she heaues them to reuenge.
1585   <S {Ti}.> {Lucius} what booke is that she tosseth so?
1586   <S {Boy}.> Grandsier 'tis Ouids Metamorphosis,
1587   My mother gaue it me.
1588   <S {Mar}.> For loue of her that's gone,
1589   Perhaps she culd it from among the rest.
1590   <S {Ti}.> Soft, so busily she turnes the leaues,
1591   Helpe her, what would she finde? {Lauinia} shall I read?
1592   This is the tragicke tale of {Philomel}?
1593   And treates of {Tereus} treason and his rape,
1594   And rape I feare was roote of thine annoy.
1595  *<S {Mar}.> See brother see, note how she quotes the leaues
1596   <S {Ti}.> {Lauinia}, wert thou thus surpriz'd sweet girle,
1597   Rauisht and wrong'd as {Philomela} was?
1598   Forc'd in the ruthlesse, vast, and gloomy woods?
1599   See, see, #I such a place there is where we did hunt,
1600   (O had we neuer, neuer hunted there)
1601   Patern'd by that the Poet heere describes,
1602   By nature made for murthers and for rapes.
1603   <S {Mar}.> O why should nature build so foule a den,
1604   Vnlesse the Gods delight in tragedies?
1605  *<S {Ti}.> Giue signes sweet girle, for heere are none but friends
1606   What Romaine Lord it was durst do the deed?
1607   Or slunke not {Saturnine}, as {Tarquin} erst,
1608   That left the Campe to sinne in {Lucrece} bed.
1609  *<S {Mar}.> Sit downe sweet Neece, brother sit downe by me,
1610   {Appollo}, {Pallas}, {Ioue}, or {Mercury},
1611   Inspire me that I may this treason finde.
1612   My Lord looke heere, looke heere {Lauinia}.
1613   <D {He writes his Name with his staffe, and guides it}
1614   {with feete and mouth}.>
1615   This sandie plot is plaine, guide if thou canst
      <P dd4v>
1616   This after me, I haue writ my name,
1617   Without the helpe of any hand at all.
1618   Curst be that hart that forc'st vs to that shift:
1619   Write thou good Neece, and heere display at last,
1620   What God will haue discouered for reuenge,
1621   Heauen guide thy pen to print thy sorrowes plaine,
1622   That we may know the Traytors and the truth.
1623   <D {She takes the staffe in her mouth, and guides it with her}
1624   {stumps and writes}.>
1625   <S {Ti}.> Oh doe ye read my Lord what she hath writ?
1626   {Stuprum, Chiron, Demetrius}.
1627   <S {Mar}.> What, what, the lustfull sonnes of {Tamora},
1628   Performers of this hainous bloody deed?
1629   <S {Ti}.> {Magni Dominator poli},
1630   {#Tam lentus  audis scelera, tam lentus vides}?
1631  *<S {Mar}.> Oh calme thee gentle Lord: Although I know
1632   There is enough written vpon this earth,
1633   To stirre a mutinie in the mildest thoughts,
1634   And arme the mindes of infants to exclaimes.
1635   My Lord kneele downe with me: {Lauinia} kneele,
1636   And kneele sweet boy, the Romaine {Hectors} hope,
1637   And sweare with me, as with the wofull Feere
1638   And father of that chast dishonoured Dame,
1639   Lord {Iunius Brutus} sweare for {Lucrece} rape,
1640   That we will prosecute (by good aduise)
1641   Mortall reuenge vpon these traytorous Gothes,
1642   And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
1643   <S {Ti}.> Tis sure enough, #and you knew how.
1644   But if you hunt these Beare- whelpes, then beware
1645   The Dam will wake, #and if she winde you once,
1646   Shee's with the Lyon deepely still in league.
1647   And lulls him whilst she playeth on her backe,
1648   And when he sleepes will she do what she list.
1649   You are a young huntsman {Marcus}, let it alone:
1650   And come, I will goe get a leafe of brasse,
1651   And with a Gad of steele will write these words,
1652   And lay it by: the angry Northerne winde
1653   Will blow these sands like {Sibels} leaues abroad,
1654   And wheres your lesson then. Boy what say you?
1655   <S {Boy}.> I say my Lord, that if I were a man,
1656   Their mothers bed- chamber should not be safe,
1657   For these bad bond- men to the yoake of Rome.
1658   <S {Mar}.> #I that's my boy, thy father hath full oft,
1659   For his vngratefull country done the like.
1660   <S {Boy}.> And Vncle so will I, #and if I liue.
1661   <S {Ti}.> Come goe with me into mine Armorie,
1662   {#Lucius} Ile fit thee, and withall, my boy
1663   Shall carry from me to the Empresse sonnes,
1664   Presents that I intend to send them both,
1665   Come, come, thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
1666   <S {Boy}.> #I with my dagger in their bosomes Grandsire:
1667   <S {Ti}.> No boy not so, Ile teach thee another course,
1668   {Lauinia} come, {Marcus} looke to my house,
1669   {#Lucius} and Ile goe braue it at the Court,
1670   #I marry will we sir, and weele be waited on.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1671   <S {Mar}.> O heauens! Can you heare a good man grone
1672   And not relent, or not compassion him?
1673   {Marcus} attend him in his extasie,
1674   That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart,
1675   Then foe- mens markes vpon his batter'd shield,
1676   But yet so iust, that he will not reuenge,
1677   Reuenge the heauens for old {Andronicus}.  <D {Exit}>
1678  *<D {Enter Aron, Chiron and Demetrius at one dore: and at another}

1682   He hath some message to deliuer vs.
1683  *<S {Aron}.> #I some mad message from his mad Grandfather.
1684   <S {Boy}.> My Lords, with all the humblenesse I may,
1685   I greete your honours from {Andronicus},
1686   And pray the Romane Gods confound you both.
1687   <S {Deme}.> Gramercie louely {Lucius}, what's the newes?
1688   For villanie's markt with rape. May it please you,
1689   My Grandsire well aduis'd hath sent by me,
1690   The goodliest weapons of his Armorie,
1691   To gratifie your honourable youth,
1692   The hope of Rome, for so he bad me say:
1693   And so I do and with his gifts present
1694   Your Lordships, when euer you haue need,
1695   You may be armed and appointed well,
1696   And so I leaue you both: like bloody villaines.  <D {Exit}>
1697  *<S {Deme}.> What's heere? a scrole, & written round about?
1698   Let's see.
1699  *{Integer vitae scelerisque purus, non egit maury iaculis nec ar-cus}.
1700  _
1701   <S {Chi}.> O 'tis a verse in {Horace}, I know it well.
1702   I read it in the Grammer long agoe.
1703   <S {Moore}.> #I iust, a verse in {Horace}: right, you haue it,
1704   Now what a thing it is to be an Asse?
1705   Heer's no sound iest, the old man hath found their guilt,
1706   And sends the weapons wrapt about with lines,
1707   That wound (beyond their feeling) to the quick:
1708   But were our witty Empresse well #a foot,
1709   She would applaud {Andronicus} conceit:
1710   But let her rest, in her vnrest #a while.
1711   And now young Lords, #was't not a happy starre
1712   Led vs to Rome strangers, and more then so;
1713   Captiues, to be aduanced to this height?
1714   It did me good before the Pallace gate,
1715   To braue the Tribune in his brothers hearing.
1716   <S {Deme}.> But me more good, to see so great a Lord
1717   Basely insinuate, and send vs gifts.
1718   <S {Moore}.> Had he not reason Lord {Demetrius}?
1719   Did you not vse his daughter very friendly?
1720   <S {Deme}.> I would we had a thousand Romane Dames
1721   At such a bay, by turne to serue our lust.
1722   <S {Chi}.> A charitable wish, and full of loue.
1723  *<S {Moore}.> Heere lack's but your mother for to say, Amen.
1724  *<S {Chi}.> And that would she for twenty thousand more.
1725   <S {Deme}.> Come, let vs go, and pray to all the Gods
1726   For our beloued mother in her paines.
1727  *<S {Moore}.> Pray to the deuils, the gods haue giuen vs ouer.
1728   <D {Flourish}.>
1729  *<S {Dem}.> Why do the Emperors trumpets flourish thus?
1730   <S {Chi}.> Belike for ioy the Emperour hath a sonne.
1731   <S {Deme}.> Soft, who comes heere?
1732   <D {Enter Nurse with a blacke #a Moore childe}.>
1733   <S {Nur}.> Good morrow Lords:
1734   O tell me, did you see {Aaron} the Moore?
1735   <S {Aron}.> Well, more or lesse, or nere a whit at all,
1736   Heere {Aaron} is, and what with {Aaron} now?
1737   <S {Nurse}.> Oh gentle {Aaron}, we are all vndone.
1738   Now helpe, or woe betide thee euermore.
1739   <S {Aron}.> Why, what a catterwalling dost thou keepe?
1740   What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine armes?
1741  *<S {Nurse}.> O that which I would hide from heauens eye,
1742   Our Empresse shame, and stately Romes disgrace,
1743   She is deliuered Lords, she is deliuered.
1744   <S {Aron}.> To whom?
1745   <S {Nurse}.> I meane she is brought #a bed?
1746   <S {Aron}.> Wel God giue her good rest,
      <P dd5>
1747   What hath he sent her?
1748   <S {Nurse}.> A deuill.
1749  *<S {Aron}.> Why then she is the Deuils Dam: a ioyfull issue.
1750  *<S {Nurse}.> A ioylesse, dismall, blacke &, sorrowfull issue,
1751   Heere is the babe as loathsome as a toad,
1752   Among'st the fairest breeders of our clime,
1753   The Empresse sends it thee, thy stampe, thy seale,
1754   And bids thee christen it with thy daggers point.
1755   <S {Aron}.> Out you whore, is black so base a hue?
1756   Sweet blowse, you are a beautious blossome sure.
1757   <S {Deme}.> Villaine what hast thou done?
1758   <S {Aron}.> That which thou canst not vndoe.
1759   <S {Chi}.> Thou hast vndone our mother.
1760   <S {Deme}.> And therein hellish dog, thou hast vndone,
1761   Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choyce,
1762   Accur'st the off- spring of so foule a fiend.
1763   <S {Chi}.> It shall not liue.
1764   <S {Aron}.> It shall not die.
1765   <S {Nurse}.> {Aaron} it must, the mother wils it so.
1766   <S {Aron}.> What, must it {Nurse}? Then let no man but I
1767   Doe execution on my flesh and blood.
1768   <S {Deme}.> Ile broach the Tadpole on my Rapiers point:
1769   <S {#Nurse}> giue it me, my sword shall soone dispatch it.
1770  *<S {Aron}.> Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels vp.
1771   Stay murtherous villaines, will you kill your brother?
1772   Now by the burning Tapers of the skie,
1773   That shone so brightly when this Boy was got,
1774   He dies vpon my Semitars sharpe point,
1775   That touches this my first borne sonne and heire.
1776   I tell you young-lings, not {Enceladus}
1777   With all his threatning band of {Typhons} broode,
1778   Nor great {Alcides}, nor the God of warre,
1779   Shall ceaze this prey out of his fathers hands:
1780   What, what, ye sanguine shallow harted Boyes,
1781   Ye white- limb'd walls, ye Ale- house painted signes,
1782   Cole- blacke is better then another hue,
1783   In that it scornes to beare another hue:
1784   For all the water in the Ocean,
1785   Can neuer turne the Swans blacke legs to white,
1786   Although she laue them hourely in the flood:
1787   Tell the Empresse from me, I am of age
1788   To keepe mine owne, excuse it how she can
1789   <S {Deme}.> Wilt thou betray thy noble mistris thus?
1790   <S {Aron}.> My mistris is my mistris: this my selfe,
1791   The vigour, and the picture of my youth:
1792   This, before all the world do I preferre,
1793   This mauger all the world will I keepe safe,
1794   Or some of you shall smoake for it in Rome.
1795   <S {Deme}.> By this our mother is for euer sham'd.
1796   <S {Chi}.> Rome will despise her for this foule escape.
1797  *<S {Nur}.> The Emperour in his rage will doome her death.
1798   <S {Chi}.> I blush to thinke vpon this ignominie.
1799  *<S {Aron}.> Why ther's the priuiledge your beauty beares:
1800   Fie trecherous hue, that will betray with blushing
1801   The close enacts and counsels of the hart:
1802   Heer's a young Lad fram'd of another leere,
1803   Looke how the blacke slaue smiles vpon the father;
1804   As who should say, old Lad I am thine owne.
1805   He is your brother Lords, sensibly fed
1806   Of that selfe blood that first gaue life to you,
1807   And from that wombe where you imprisoned were
1808   He is infranchised and come to light:
1809   Nay he is your brother by the surer side,
1810   Although my seale be stamped in his face.
1811   <S {Nurse}.> {Aaron} what shall I say vnto the Empresse?
1812   <S {Dem}.> Aduise thee {Aaron}, what is to be done,
1813   And we will all subscribe to thy aduise:
1814   Saue thou the child, so we may all be safe.
1815   <S {Aron}.> Then sit we downe and let vs all consult.
1816   My sonne and I will haue the winde of you:
1817   Keepe there, now talke at pleasure of your safety.
1818   <S {Deme}.> How many women saw this childe of his?
1819  *<S {Aron}.> Why so braue Lords, when we ioyne in league
1820   I am a Lambe: but if you braue the {Moore},
1821   The chafed Bore, the mountaine Lyonesse,
1822   The Ocean swells not so as {Aaron} stormes:
1823   But say againe, how many saw the childe?
1824   <S {Nurse}.> {Cornelia}, the midwife, and my selfe,
1825   And none else but the deliuered Empresse.
1826   <S {Aron}.> The Empresse, the Midwife, and your selfe,
1827   Two may keepe counsell, when the third's away:
1828   Goe to the Empresse, tell her this I said,  <D {He kils her}>
1829   Weeke, weeke, so cries a Pigge prepared to th' spit.
1830   <S {Deme}.> What mean'st thou {Aron}?
1831   Wherefore did'st thou this?
1832   <S {Aron}.> O Lord sir, 'tis a deed of pollicie?
1833   Shall she liue to betray this guilt of our's:
1834   A long tongu'd babling Gossip? No Lords no:
1835   And now be it knowne to you my full intent.
1836   Not farre, one {Muliteus} my Country- man
1837   His wife but yesternight was brought to bed,
1838   His childe is like to her, faire as you are:
1839   Goe packe with them, and giue the mother gold,
1840   And tell them both the circumstance of all,
1841   And how by this their Childe shall be aduaunc'd,
1842   And be receiued for the Emperours heyre,
1843   And substituted in the place of mine,
1844   To calme this tempest whirling in the Court,
1845   And let the Emperour dandle him for his owne,
1846   Harke ye Lords, ye see I haue giuen her physicke,
1847   And you must needs bestow her funerall,
1848   The fields are neere, and you are gallant Groomes:
1849   This done, see that you take no longer daies
1850   But send the Midwife presently to me.
1851   The Midwife and the Nurse well made away,
1852   Then let the Ladies tattle what they please.
1853  *<S {Chi}.> {Aaron} I see thou wilt not trust the ayre with se-|(crets.
1854   <S {Deme}.> For this care of {Tamora},
1855   Her selfe, and hers are highly bound to thee.  <D {Exeunt}.>
1856  *<S {Aron}.> Now to the Gothes, as swift as Swallow flies,
1857   There to dispose this treasure in mine armes,
1858   And secretly to greete the Empresse friends:
1859   Come on you thick- lipt- slaue, Ile beare you hence,
1860   For it is you that puts vs to our shifts:
1861   Ile make you feed on berries, and on rootes,
1862   And feed on curds and whay, and sucke the Goate,
1863   And cabbin in a Caue, and bring you vp
1864   To be a warriour, and command a Campe.  <D {Exit}>
1865  *<D {Enter Titus, old Marcus, young Lucius, and other gentlemen}
1866   {with bowes, and Titus beares the arrowes with}

1868   <S {Tit}.> Come {Marcus}, come, kinsmen this is the way.
1869   Sir Boy let me see your Archerie,
1870   Looke yee draw home enough, and 'tis there straight:
1871   {Terras Astrea reliquit}, be you remembred {Marcus}.
1872   She's gone, she's fled, sirs take you to your tooles,
1873   You Cosens shall goe sound the Ocean:
1874   And cast your nets, haply you may find her in the Sea,
1875   Yet ther's as little iustice as at Land:
1876   No {Publius} and {Sempronius}, you must doe it,
      <P dd5v>
1877   'Tis you must dig with Mattocke, and with Spade,
1878   And pierce the inmost Center of the earth:
1879   Then when you come to {Plutoes} Region,
1880   I pray you deliuer him this petition,
1881   Tell him it is for iustice, and for aide,
1882   And that it comes from old {Andronicus},
1883   Shaken with sorrowes in vngratefull Rome.
1884   Ah Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable,
1885   What time I threw the peoples suffrages
1886   On him that thus doth tyrannize ore me.
1887   Goe get you gone, and pray be carefull all,
1888   And leaue you not a man of warre vnsearcht,
1889   This wicked Emperour may haue shipt her hence,
1890   And kinsmen then we may goe pipe for iustice.
1891   <S {Marc}.> O {Publius} is not this a heauie case
1892   To see thy Noble Vnckle thus distract?
1893   <S {Publ}.> Therefore my Lords it highly vs concernes,
1894   By day and night t' attend him carefully:
1895   And feede his humour kindely as we may,
1896   Till time beget some carefull remedie.
1897   <S {Marc}.> Kinsmen, his sorrowes are past remedie.
1898   Ioyne with the Gothes, and with reuengefull warre,
1899   Take wreake on Rome for this ingratitude,
1900   And vengeance on the Traytor {Saturnine}.
1901   <S {Tit}.> {Publius} how now? how now my Maisters?
1902   What haue you met with her?
1903   <S {Publ}.> No my good Lord, but {Pluto} sends you word,
1904   If you will haue reuenge from #hell you shall,
1905   Marrie for iustice she is so imploy'd,
1906   He thinkes with {Ioue} in heauen, or some where else:
1907   So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
1908   <S {Tit}.> He doth me wrong to feed me with delayes,
1909   Ile diue into the burning Lake below,
1910   And pull her out of {Acaron} by the heeles.
1911   {Marcus} we are but shrubs, no Cedars we,
1912   No big- bon'd- men, fram'd of the Cyclops size,
1913   But mettall {Marcus} steele to the very backe,
1914  *Yet wrung with wrongs more then our backe can beare:
1915   And sith there's no iustice in earth nor #hell,
1916   We will sollicite heauen, and moue the Gods
1917   To send downe Iustice for to wreake our wrongs:
1918   Come to this geare, you are a good Archer {Marcus}.
1919   <D {He giues them the Arrowes}.>
1920   {Ad Iouem}, that's for you: here {ad Appollonem},
1921   {Ad Martem}, that's for my selfe,
1922   Heere Boy to {Pallas}, heere to {Mercury},
1923   To {Saturnine}, to {Caius}, not to {Saturnine},
1924   You were as good to shoote against the winde.
1925   #Too it Boy, {Marcus} loose when I bid:
1926   Of my word, I haue written to effect,
1927   Ther's not a God left vnsollicited.
1928  *<S {Marc}.> Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the Court,
1929   We will afflict the Emperour in his pride.
1930   <S {Tit}.> Now Maisters draw, Oh well said {Lucius}:
1931   Good Boy in {Virgoes} lap, giue it {Pallas}.
1932   <S {Marc}.> My Lord, I aime a Mile beyond the Moone,
1933   Your letter is with {Iupiter} by this.
1934   <S {Tit}.> Ha, ha, {Publius}, {Publius}, what hast thou done?
1935   See, see, thou hast shot off one of {Taurus} hornes.
1936  *<S {Mar}.> This was the sport my Lord, when {Publius} shot,
1937   The Bull being gal'd, gaue {Aries} such a knocke,
1938   That downe fell both the Rams hornes in the Court,
1939   And who should finde them but the Empresse villaine:
1940   She laught, and told the Moore he should not choose
1941   But giue them to his Maister for a present.
1942  *<S {Tit}.> Why there it goes, God giue your Lordship ioy.
1943   <D {Enter the Clowne with a basket and two Pigeons in it}.>
1944   <S {Titus}.> Newes, newes, from heauen,
1945   {Marcus} the poast is come.
1946   Sirrah, what tydings? haue you any letters?
1947   Shall I haue Iustice, what sayes {Iupiter}?
1948  *<S {Clowne}.> Ho the Iibbetmaker, he sayes that he hath ta-ken
1949  *them downe againe, for the man must not be hang'd
1950   till the next weeke.
1951   <S {Tit}.> But what sayes {Iupiter} I aske thee?
1952   <S {Clowne}.> Alas sir I know not {Iupiter}:
1953   I neuer dranke with him in all my life.
1954   <S {Tit}.> Why villaine art not thou the Carrier?
1955   <S {Clowne}.> #I of my Pigions sir, nothing else.
1956   <S {Tit}.> Why, did'st thou not come from heauen?
1957   <S {Clowne}.> From heauen? Alas sir, I neuer came there,
1958  *God forbid I should be so bold, to presse to heauen in my
1959  *young dayes. Why I am going with my pigeons to the
1960  *Tribunall Plebs, to take vp a matter of brawle, betwixt
1961   my Vncle, and one of the Emperialls men.
1962  *<S {Mar}.> Why sir, that is as fit as can be to serue for your
1963  *Oration, and let him deliuer the Pigions to the Emperour
1964   from you.
1965  *<S {Tit}.> Tell mee, can you deliuer an Oration to the Em-perour
1966   with a Grace?
1967  *<S {Clowne}.> Nay truely sir, I could neuer say grace in all
1968   my life.
1969   <S {Tit}.> Sirrah come hither, make no more adoe,
1970   But giue your Pigeons to the Emperour,
1971   By me thou shalt haue Iustice at his hands.
1972   Hold, hold, meane while her's money for thy charges.
1973   Giue me pen and inke.
1974   Sirrah, can you with a Grace deliuer a Supplication?
1975   <S {Clowne}.> #I sir
1976  *<S {Titus}.> Then here is a Supplication for you, and when
1977  *you come to him, at the first approach you must kneele,
1978  *then kisse his foote, then deliuer vp your Pigeons, and
1979  *then looke for your reward. Ile be at hand sir, see you do
1980   it brauely.
1981   <S {Clowne}.> I warrant you sir, let me alone.
1982   <S {Tit}.> Sirrha hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
1983   Heere {Marcus}, fold it in the Oration,
1984   For thou hast made it like an humble Suppliant:
1985   And when thou hast giuen it the Emperour,
1986   Knocke at my dore, and tell me what he sayes.
1987   <S {Clowne}.> God be with you sir, I will.  <D {Exit}.>
1988   <S {Tit}.> Come {Marcus} let vs goe, {Publius} follow me.
1989   <D {Exeunt}.>
1990   <D {Enter Emperour and Empresse, and her two sonnes, the}
1991   {Emperour brings the Arrowes in his hand}
1992   {that Titus shot at him}.>
1993   <S {Satur}.> Why Lords,
1994   What wrongs are these? was euer seene
1995   An Emperour in Rome thus ouerborne,
1996   Troubled, Confronted thus, and for the extent
1997   Of egall iustice, vs'd in such contempt?
1998   My Lords, you know the mightfull Gods,
1999   (How euer these disturbers of our peace
2000   Buz in the peoples eares) there nought hath past,
2001   But euen with law against the willfull Sonnes
2002   Of old {Andronicus}. And what #and if
2003   His sorrowes haue so ouerwhelm'd his wits,
2004   Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreakes,
2005   His fits, his frenzie, and his bitternesse?
2006   And now he writes to heauen for his redresse.
2007   See, heeres to {Ioue}, and this to {Mercury},
      <P dd6>
2008   This to {Apollo}, this to the God of warre:
2009   Sweet scrowles to flie about the streets of Rome:
2010   What's this but Libelling against the Senate,
2011   And blazoning our Iniustice euery where?
2012   A goodly humour, is it not my Lords?
2013   As who would say, in Rome no Iustice were.
2014   But if I liue, his fained extasies
2015   Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
2016   But he and his shall know, that Iustice liues
2017   In {Saturninus} health; whom if he sleepe,
2018   Hee'l so awake, as he in fury shall
2019   Cut off the proud'st Conspirator that liues.
2020   <S {Tamo}.> My gracious Lord, my louely {Saturnine},
2021   Lord of my life, Commander of my thoughts,
2022   Calme thee, and beare the faults of {Titus} age,
2023   Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant Sonnes,
2024   Whose losse hath pier'st him deepe, and scar'd his heart;
2025   And rather comfort his distressed plight,
2026   Then prosecute the meanest or the best
2027   For these contempts. Why thus it shall become
2028   High witted {Tamora} to glose with all:  <D {Aside}.>
2029   But {Titus}, I haue touch'd thee to the quicke,
2030   Thy life blood out: If {Aaron} now be wise,
2031   Then is all safe, the Anchor's in the Port.
2032   <D {Enter Clowne}.>
2033   How now good fellow, would'st thou speake with vs?
2034  *<S {Clow}.> Yea forsooth, #and your Mistership be Emperiall.
2035   <S {Tam}.> Empresse I am, but yonder sits the Emperour.
2036  *<S {Clo}.> 'Tis he; God & Saint Stephen giue you good den;
2037  *I haue brought you a Letter, & a couple of Pigions heere.
2038   <D {He reads the Letter}.>
2039   <S {Satu}.> Goe take him away, and hang him presently.
2040   <S {Clowne}.> How much money must I haue?
2041   <S {Tam}.> Come sirrah you must be hang'd.
2042  *<S {Clow}.> Hang'd? ber Lady, then I haue brought vp a neck
2043   to a faire end.  <D {Exit}.>
2044   <S {Satu}.> Despightfull and intollerable wrongs,
2045   Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
2046   I know from whence this same deuise proceedes:
2047   May this be borne? As if his traytrous Sonnes,
2048   That dy'd by law for murther of our Brother,
2049   Haue by my meanes beene butcher'd wrongfully?
2050   Goe dragge the villaine hither by the haire,
2051   Nor Age, nor Honour, shall shape priuiledge:
2052   For this proud mocke, Ile be thy slaughter man:
2053   Sly franticke wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
2054   In hope thy selfe should gouerne Rome and me.
2055   <D {Enter Nuntius Emillius}.>
2056   <S {Satur}.> What newes with thee {Emillius}?
2057   <S {Emil}.> Arme my Lords, Rome neuer had more cause,
2058   The Gothes haue gather'd head, and with a power
2059   Of high resolued men, bent to the spoyle
2060   They hither march amaine, vnder conduct
2061   Of {Lucius}, Sonne to old {Andronicus}:
2062   Who threats in course of this reuenge to do
2063   As much as euer {Coriolanus} did.
2064   <S {King}.> Is warlike {Lucius} Generall of the Gothes?
2065   These tydings nip me, and I hang the head
2066  *As flowers with frost, or grasse beat downe with stormes:
2067   #I, now begins our sorrowes to approach,
2068   'Tis he the common people loue so much,
2069   My selfe hath often heard them say,
2070   (When I haue walked like a priuate man)
2071   That {Lucius} banishment was wrongfully,
2072   And they haue wisht that {Lucius} were their Emperour.
2073  *<S {Tam}.> Why should you feare? Is not our City strong?
2074   <S {King}.> #I, but the Cittizens fauour {Lucius},
2075   And will reuolt from me, to succour him.
2076  *<S {Tam}.> {King}, be thy thoughts Imperious like thy name.
2077   Is the Sunne dim'd, that Gnats do flie in it?
2078   The Eagle suffers little Birds to sing,
2079   And is not carefull what they meane thereby,
2080   Knowing that with the shadow of his wings,
2081   He can at pleasure stint their melodie.
2082   Euen so mayest thou, the giddy men of Rome,
2083   Then cheare thy spirit, for know thou Emperour,
2084   I will enchaunt the old {Andronicus},
2085   With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous
2086   Then baites to fish, or hony stalkes to sheepe,
2087   When as the one is wounded with the baite,
2088   The other rotted with delicious foode.
2089   <S {King}.> But he will not entreat his Sonne for vs.
2090   <S {Tam}.> If {Tamora} entreat him, then he will,
2091   For I can smooth and fill his aged eare,
2092   With golden promises, that were his heart
2093   Almost Impregnable, his old eares deafe,
2094   Yet should both eare and heart, obey my tongue.
2095   Goe thou before to our Embassadour,
2096   Say, that the Emperour requests a parly
2097   Of warlike {Lucius}, and appoint the meeting.
2098   <S {King}.> {Emillius} do this message Honourably,
2099   And if he stand in Hostage for his safety,
2100   Bid him demaund what pledge will please him best.
2101   <S {Emill}.> Your bidding shall I do effectually.  <D {Exit}.>
2102   <S {Tam}.> Now will I to that old {Andronicus},
2103   And temper him with all the #Art I haue,
2104   To plucke proud {Lucius} from the warlike Gothes.
2105   And now sweet Emperour be blithe againe,
2106   And bury all thy feare in my deuises.
2107  *<S {Satu}.> Then goe successantly and plead for him.  <D {Exit}.>
2108   <Z {Actus Quintus}.>
2109   <D {Flourish. Enter Lucius with an Army of Gothes},
2110   {with Drum and Souldiers}.>
2111  *<S {Luci}.> Approued warriours, and my faithfull Friends,
2112   I haue receiued Letters from great Rome,
2113   Which signifies what hate they beare their Emperour,
2114   And how desirous of our sight they are.
2115   Therefore great Lords, be as your Titles witnesse,
2116   Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
2117   And wherein Rome hath done you any scathe,
2118   Let him make treble satisfaction.
2119   <S {Goth}.> Braue slip, sprung from the Great {Andronicus},
2120   Whose name was once our terrour, now our comfort,
2121   Whose high exploits, and honourable Deeds,
2122   Ingratefull Rome requites with foule contempt:
2123   Behold in vs, weele follow where thou lead'st,
2124   Like stinging Bees in hottest Sommers day,
2125   Led by their Maister to the flowred fields,
2126   And be aueng'd on cursed {Tamora}:
2127   And as he saith, so say we all with him.
2128   <S {Luci}.> I humbly thanke him, and I thanke you all.
2129   But who comes heere, led by a lusty {Goth}?
2130   <D {Enter a Goth leading #of Aaron with his child}
2131   {in his armes}.>
2132   <S {Goth}.> Renowned {Lucius}, from our troups I straid,
2133   To gaze vpon a ruinous Monasterie,
      <P dd6v>
2134   And as I earnestly did fixe mine eye
2135   Vpon the wasted building, suddainely
2136   I heard a childe cry vnderneath a wall:
2137   I made vnto the noyse, when soone I heard,
2138   The crying babe control'd with this discourse:
2139   Peace Tawny slaue, halfe me, and halfe thy Dam,
2140   Did not thy Hue bewray whose brat thou art?
2141   Had nature lent thee, but thy Mothers looke,
2142   Villaine thou might'st haue bene an Emperour.
2143   But where the Bull and Cow are both milk- white,
2144   They neuer do beget a cole- blacke- Calfe:
2145   Peace, villaine peace, euen thus he rates the babe,
2146   For I must beare thee to a trusty Goth,
2147   Who when he knowes thou art the Empresse babe,
2148   Will hold thee dearely for thy Mothers sake.
2149   With this, my weapon drawne I rusht vpon him,
2150   Surpriz'd him suddainely, and brought him hither
2151   To vse, as you thinke needefull of the man.
2152   <S {Luci}.> Oh worthy Goth, this is the incarnate deuill,
2153   That rob'd {Andronicus} of his good hand:
2154   This is the Pearle that pleas'd your Empresse eye,
2155   And heere's the Base Fruit of his burning lust.
2156   Say wall- ey'd slaue, whether would'st thou conuay
2157   This growing Image of thy fiend- like face?
2158   Why dost not speake? what deafe? Not a word?
2159   A halter Souldiers, hang him on this Tree,
2160   And by his side his Fruite of Bastardie.
2161   <S {Aron}.> Touch not the Boy, he is of Royall blood.
2162   <S {Luci}.> Too like the Syre for euer being good.
2163   First hang the Child that he may see it sprall,
2164   A sight to vexe the Fathers soule withall.
2165   <S {Aron}.> Get me a Ladder {Lucius}, saue the Childe,
2166   And beare it from me to the Empresse:
2167   If thou do this, Ile shew thee wondrous things,
2168   That highly may aduantage thee to heare;
2169   If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
2170   Ile speake no more: but vengeance rot you all.
2171  *<S {Luci}.> Say on, and if it please me which thou speak'st,
2172   Thy child shall liue, and I will see it Nourisht.
2173   <S {Aron}.> #And if it please thee? why assure thee {Lucius},
2174   'Twill vexe thy soule to heare what I shall speake:
2175   For I must talke of Murthers, Rapes, and Massacres,
2176   Acts of Blacke- night, abhominable Deeds,
2177   Complots of Mischiefe, Treason, Villanies
2178   Ruthfull to heare, yet pittiously perform'd,
2179   And this shall all be buried by my death,
2180   Vnlesse thou sweare to me my Childe shall liue.
2181   <S {Luci}.> Tell on thy minde,
2182   I say thy Childe shall liue.
2183   <S {Aron}.> Sweare that he shall, and then I will begin.
2184   <S {Luci}.> Who should I sweare by,
2185   Thou beleeuest no God,
2186   That graunted, how can'st thou beleeue an oath?
2187   <S {Aron}.> What if I do not, as indeed I do not,
2188   Yet for I know thou art Religious,
2189   And hast a thing within thee, called Conscience,
2190   With twenty Popish trickes and Ceremonies,
2191   Which I haue seene thee carefull to obserue:
2192   Therefore I vrge thy oath, for that I know
2193   An Ideot holds his Bauble for a God,
2194   And keepes the oath which by that God he sweares,
2195   To that Ile vrge him: therefore thou shalt vow
2196   By that same God, what God so ere it be
2197   That thou adorest, and #hast in reuerence,
2198   To saue my Boy, to nourish and bring him vp,
2199   Ore else I will discouer nought to thee.
2200   <S {Luci}.> Euen by my God I sweare  to thee I will.
2201   <S {Aron}.> First know thou,
2202   I begot  him on the Empresse.
2203   <S {Luci}.> Oh most Insatiate luxurious woman!
2204   <S {Aron}.> Tut {Lucius}, this was but a deed of Charitie,
2205   To that which thou shalt heare of me anon,
2206   'Twas her two Sonnes that murdered {Bassianus},
2207   They cut thy Sisters tongue, and rauisht her,
2208   And cut her hands off, and trim'd her as thou saw'st.
2209   <S {Lucius}.> Oh detestable villaine!
2210   Call'st thou that Trimming?
2211   <S {Aron}.> Why she was washt, and cut, and trim'd,
2212   And 'twas trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
2213   <S {Luci}.> Oh barbarous beastly villaines like thy selfe!
2214   <S {Aron}.> Indeede, I was their Tutor to instruct them
2215   That Codding spirit had they from their Mother,
2216   As sure a Card as euer wonne the Set:
2217   That bloody minde I thinke they learn'd of me,
2218   As true a Dog as euer fought at head.
2219   Well, let my Deeds be witnesse of my worth:
2220   I trayn'd thy Bretheren to that guilefull Hole,
2221   Where the dead Corps of {Bassianus} lay:
2222   I wrote the Letter, that thy Father found,
2223   And hid the Gold within the Letter mention'd.
2224   Confederate with the Queene, and her two Sonnes,
2225   And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
2226   Wherein I had no stroke of Mischeife in it.
2227   I play'd the Cheater for thy Fathers hand,
2228   And when I had it, drew my selfe apart,
2229   And almost broke my heart with extreame laughter.
2230   I pried me through the Creuice of a Wall,
2231   When for his hand, he had his two Sonnes heads,
2232   Beheld his teares, and laught so hartily,
2233   That both mine eyes were rainie like to his:
2234   And when I told the Empresse of this sport,
2235   She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,
2236   And for my tydings, gaue me twenty kisses.
2237   <S {Goth}.> What canst thou say all this, and neuer blush?
2238   <S {Aron}.> #I, like a blacke Dogge, as the saying is.
2239   <S {Luci}.> Art thou not sorry for these hainous deedes?
2240   <S {Aron}.> #I, that I had not done a thousand more:
2241   Euen now I curse the day, and yet I thinke
2242   Few come within few compasse of my curse,
2243   Wherein I did not some Notorious #ill,
2244   As kill a man, or else deuise his death,
2245   Rauish a Maid, or plot the way to do it,
2246   Accuse some Innocent, and forsweare my selfe,
2247   Set deadly Enmity betweene two Friends,
2248   Make poore mens Cattell breake their neckes,
2249   Set fire on Barnes and Haystackes in the night,
2250   And bid the Owners quench them with the teares:
2251   Oft haue I dig'd vp dead men from their graues,
2252   And set them vpright at their deere Friends doore,
2253   Euen when their sorrowes almost was forgot,
2254   And on their skinnes, as on the Barke of Trees,
2255   Haue with my knife carued in Romaine Letters,
2256   Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.
2257   Tut, I haue done a thousand dreadfull things
2258   As willingly, as one would kill a Fly,
2259   And nothing greeues me hartily indeede,
2260   But that I cannot doe ten thousand more.
2261   <S {Luci}.> Bring downe the diuell, for he must not die
2262   So sweet a death as hanging presently.
2263   <S {Aron}.> If there be diuels, would I were a deuill,
2264   To liue and burne in euerlasting fire,
2265   So I might haue your company in #hell,
      <P ee1>
2266   But to torment you with my bitter tongue.
2267   <S {Luci}.> Sirs stop his mouth, & let him speake no more.
2268   <D {Enter Emillius}.>
2269   <S {Goth}.> My Lord, there is a Messenger from Rome
2270   Desires to be admitted to your presence.
2271   <S {Luc}.> Let him come neere.
2272   Welcome {Emillius}, what the newes from Rome?
2273   <S {Emi}.> Lord {Lucius}, and you Princes of the Gothes,
2274   The Romaine Emperour greetes you all by me,
2275   And for he vnderstands you are in Armes,
2276   He craues a parly at your Fathers house
2277   Willing you to demand your Hostages,
2278   And they shall be immediately deliuered.
2279   <S {Goth}.> What saies our Generall?
2280   <S {Luc}.> {Emillius}, let the Emperour giue his pledges
2281   Vnto my Father, and my Vncle {Marcus},  <D {Flourish}.>
2282   And we will come: march away.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2283   <D {Enter Tamora, and her two Sonnes disguised}.>
2284   <S {Tam}.> Thus in this strange and sad Habilliament,
2285   I will encounter with {Andronicus},
2286   And say, I am Reuenge sent from below,
2287   To ioyne with him and right his hainous wrongs:
2288   Knocke at his study where they say he keepes,
2289   To ruminate strange plots of dire Reuenge,
2290   Tell him Reuenge is come to ioyne with him,
2291   And worke confusion on his Enemies.
2292   <D {They knocke and Titus opens his study dore}.>
2293   <S {Tit}.> Who doth mollest my Contemplation?
2294   Is it your tricke to make me ope the dore,
2295   That so my sad decrees may flie away,
2296   And all my studie be to no effect?
2297   You are deceiu'd, for what I meane to do,
2298   See heere in bloody lines I haue set downe:
2299   And what is written shall be executed.
2300   <S {Tam}.> {Titus}, I am come to talke with thee,
2301   <S {Tit}.> No not a word: how can I grace my talke,
2302   Wanting a hand to giue it action,
2303   Thou hast the ods of me, therefore no more.
2304   <S {Tam}.> If thou did'st know me,
2305   Thou would'st talke with me.
2306   <S {Tit}.> I am not mad, I know thee well enough,
2307   Witnesse this wretched stump,
2308   Witnesse these crimson lines,
2309   Witnesse these Trenches made by griefe and care,
2310   Witnesse the tyring day, and heauie night,
2311   Witnesse all sorrow, that I know thee well
2312   For our proud Empresse, Mighty {Tamora}:
2313   Is not thy comming for my other hand?
2314   <S {Tamo}.> Know thou sad man, I am not {Tamora},
2315   She is thy Enemie, and I thy Friend,
2316   I am Reuenge sent from th' infernall Kingdome,
2317   To ease the gnawing Vulture of the mind,
2318   By working wreakefull vengeance on my Foes:
2319   Come downe and welcome me to this worlds light,
2320   Conferre with me of Murder and of Death,
2321   Ther's not a hollow Caue or lurking place,
2322   No Vast obscurity, or Misty vale,
2323   Where bloody Murther or detested Rape,
2324   Can couch for feare, but I will finde them out,
2325   And in their eares tell them my dreadfull name,
2326   Reuenge, which makes the foule offenders quake.
2327   <S {Tit}.> Art thou Reuenge? and art thou sent to me,
2328   To be a torment to mine Enemies?
2329   <S {Tam}.> I am, therefore come downe and welcome me.
2330   <S {Tit}.> Doe me some seruice ere I come to thee:
2331   Loe by thy side where Rape and Murder stands,
2332   Now giue some surance that thou art Reuenge,
2333   Stab them, or teare them on thy Chariot wheeles,
2334   And then Ile come and be thy Waggoner,
2335   And whirle along with thee about the Globes.
2336   Prouide thee two proper Palfries, as blacke as Iet,
2337   To hale thy vengefull Waggon swift away,
2338   And finde out Murder in their guilty cares.
2339   And when thy Car is loaden with their heads,
2340   I will dismount, and by the Waggon wheele,
2341   Trot like a Seruile footeman all day long,
2342   Euen from {Eptons} rising in the East,
2343   Vntill his very downefall in the Sea.
2344   And day by day Ile do this heauy taske,
2345   So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
2346   <S {Tam}.> These are my Ministers, and come with me.
2347   <S {Tit}.> Are them thy Ministers, what are they call'd?
2348   <S {Tam}.> Rape and Murder, therefore called so,
2349   Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
2350  *<S {Tit}.> Good Lord how like the Empresse Sons they are,
2351   And you the Empresse: But we worldly men,
2352   Haue miserable mad mistaking eyes:
2353   Oh sweet Reuenge, now do I come to thee,
2354   And if one armes imbracement will content thee,
2355   I will imbrace thee in it #by and by.
2356   <S {Tam}.> This closing with him, fits his Lunacie,
2357   What ere I forge to feede his braine- sicke fits,
2358   Do you vphold, and maintaine in your speeches,
2359   For now he firmely takes me for Reuenge,
2360   And being Credulous in this mad thought,
2361   Ile make him send for {Lucius} his Sonne,
2362   And whil'st I at a Banquet hold him sure,
2363   Ile find some cunning practise out of hand
2364   To scatter and disperse the giddie Gothes,
2365   Or at the least make them his Enemies:
2366   See heere he comes, and I must play my theame.
2367   <S {Tit}.> Long haue I bene forlorne, and all for thee,
2368   Welcome dread Fury to my woefull house,
2369   Rapine and Murther, you are welcome too,
2370   How like the Empresse and her Sonnes you are.
2371   Well are you fitted, had you but a Moore,
2372   Could not all #hell afford you such a deuill?
2373   For well I wote the Empresse neuer wags;
2374   But in her company there is a Moore,
2375   And would you represent our Queene aright
2376   It were conuenient you had such a deuill:
2377   But welcome as you are, what shall we doe?
2378   <S {Tam}.> What would'st thou haue vs doe {Andronicus}?
2379   <S {Dem}.> Shew me a Murtherer, Ile deale with him.
2380   <S {Chi}.> Shew me a Villaine that hath done a Rape,
2381   And I am sent to be reueng'd on him.
2382  *<S {Tam}.> Shew me a thousand that haue done thee wrong,
2383   And Ile be reuenged on them all.
2384   <S {Tit}.> Looke round about the wicked streets of Rome,
2385   And when thou find'st a man that's like thy selfe,
2386   Good Murder stab him, hee's a Murtherer.
2387   Goe thou with him, and when it is thy hap
2388   To finde another that is like to thee,
2389   Good Rapine stab him, he is a Rauisher.
2390   Go thou with them, and in the Emperours Court,
2391   There is a Queene attended by a Moore,
2392   Well maist thou know her by thy owne proportion,
2393   For vp and downe she doth resemble thee.
2394   I pray thee doe on them some violent death,
2395   They haue bene violent to me and mine.
      <P ee1v>
2396   <S {Tam}.> Well hast thou lesson'd vs, this shall we do.
2397   But would it please thee good {Andronicus},
2398   To send for {Lucius} thy thrice Valiant Sonne,
2399  *Who leades towards Rome a Band of Warlike Gothes,
2400   And bid him come and Banquet at thy house.
2401   When he is heere, euen at thy Solemne Feast,
2402   I will bring in the Empresse and her Sonnes,
2403   The Emperour himselfe, and all thy Foes,
2404   And at thy mercy shall they stoop, and kneele,
2405   And on them shalt thou ease, thy angry heart:
2406   What saies {Andronicus} to this deuise?
2407   <D {Enter Marcus}.>
2408   <S {Tit}.> {Marcus} my Brother, 'tis sad {Titus} calls,
2409   Go gentle {Marcus} to thy Nephew {Lucius},
2410   Thou shalt enquire him out among the Gothes,
2411   Bid him repaire to me, and bring with him
2412   Some of the chiefest Princes of the Gothes,
2413   Bid him encampe his Souldiers where they are,
2414   Tell him the Emperour, and the Empresse too,
2415   Feasts at my house, and he shall Feast with them,
2416   This do thou for my loue, and so let him,
2417   As he regards his aged Fathers life.
2418   <S {Mar}.> This will I do, and soone returne againe.
2419   <S {Tam}.> Now will I hence about thy businesse,
2420   And take my Ministers along with me.
2421   <S {Tit}.> Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
2422   Or els Ile call my Brother backe againe,
2423   And cleaue to no reuenge but {Lucius}.
2424   <S {Tam}.> What say you Boyes, will you bide with him,
2425   Whiles I goe tell my Lord the Emperour,
2426   How I haue gouern'd our determined iest?
2427   Yeeld to his Humour, smooth and speake him faire,
2428   And tarry with him till I turne againe.
2429   <S {Tit}.> I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
2430   And will ore- reach them in their owne deuises,
2431   A payre of cursed hell- hounds and their Dam.
2432   <S {Dem}.> Madam depart at pleasure, leaue vs heere.
2433   <S {Tam}.> Farewell {Andronicus}, reuenge now goes
2434   To lay a complot to betray thy Foes.
2435  *<S {Tit}.> I know thou doo'st, and sweet reuenge farewell.
2436   <S {Chi}.> Tell vs old man, how shall we be imploy'd?
2437   <S {Tit}.> Tut, I haue worke enough for you to doe,
2438   {Publius} come hither, {Caius}, and {Valentine}.
2439   <S {Pub}.> What is your #will?
2440   <S {Tit}.> Know you these two?
2441   <S {Pub}.> The Empresse Sonnes
2442   I take them, {Chiron}, {Demetrius}.
2443   <S {Titus}.> Fie {Publius}, fie, thou art too much deceau'd,
2444   The one is Murder, Rape is the others name,
2445   And therefore bind them gentle {Publius},
2446   {Caius}, and {Valentine}, lay hands on them,
2447   Oft haue you heard me wish for such an houre,
2448   And now I find it, therefore binde them sure,
2449  *<S {Chi}.> Villaines forbeare, we are the Empresse Sonnes.
2450  *<S {Pub}.> And therefore do we, what we are commanded.
2451   Stop close their mouthes, let them not speake a word,
2452   Is he sure bound, looke that you binde them fast.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2453   <D {Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife, and Lauinia}
2454   {with a Bason}.>
2455  *<S {Tit}.> Come, come {Lauinia}, looke, thy Foes are bound,
2456   Sirs stop their mouthes, let them not speake to me,
2457   But let them heare what fearefull words I vtter.
2458   Oh Villaines, {Chiron}, and {Demetrius},
2459  *Here stands the spring whom you haue stain'd with mud,
2460   This goodly Sommer with your Winter mixt,
2461   You kil'd her husband, and for that vil'd fault,
2462   Two of her Brothers were condemn'd to death,
2463   My hand cut off, and made a merry iest,
2464   Both her sweet Hands, her Tongue, and that more deere
2465   Then Hands or tongue, her spotlesse Chastity,
2466   Inhumaine Traytors, you constrain'd and for'st.
2467   What would you say, if I should let you speake?
2468   Villaines for shame you could not beg for grace.
2469   Harke Wretches, how I meane to martyr you,
2470   This one Hand yet is left, to cut your throats,
2471   Whil'st that {Lauinia} tweene her stumps doth hold:
2472   The Bason that receiues your guilty blood.
2473   You know your Mother meanes to feast with me,
2474   And calls herselfe Reuenge, and thinkes me mad.
2475   Harke Villaines, I will grin'd your bones to dust,
2476   And with your blood and it, Ile make a Paste,
2477   And of the Paste a Coffen I will reare,
2478   And make two Pasties of your shamefull Heads,
2479   And bid that strumpet your vnhallowed Dam,
2480   Like to the earth swallow her increase.
2481   This is the Feast, that I haue bid her to,
2482   And this the Banquet she shall surfet on,
2483   For worse then {Philomel} you vsd my Daughter,
2484   And worse then {Progne}, I will be reueng'd,
2485   And now prepare your throats: {Lauinia} come.
2486   Receiue the blood, and when that they are dead,
2487   Let me goe grin'd their Bones to powder small,
2488   And with this hatefull Liquor temper it,
2489   And in that Paste let their vil'd Heads be bakte,
2490   Come, come, be euery one officious,
2491   To make this Banket, which I wish might proue,
2492   More sterne and bloody then the Centaures Feast.
2493   <D {He cuts their throats}.>
2494   So now bring them in, for Ile play the Cooke,
2495   And see them ready, gainst their Mother comes.  <D {Exeunt}.>
2496   <D {Enter Lucius, Marcus, and the Gothes}.>
2497   <S {Luc}.> Vnckle {Marcus}, since 'tis my Fathers minde
2498   That I repair to Rome, I am content.
2499   <S {Goth}.> And ours with thine befall, what Fortune will.
2500  *<S {Luc}.> Good Vnckle take you in this barbarous {Moore},
2501   This Rauenous Tiger, this accursed deuill,
2502   Let him receiue no sustenance, fetter him,
2503   Till he be brought vnto the Emperours face,
2504   For testimony of her foule proceedings.
2505   And see the Ambush of our Friends be strong,
2506   If ere the Emperour meanes no good to vs.
2507   <S {Aron}.> Some deuill whisper curses in my eare,
2508   And prompt me that my tongue may vtter forth,
2509   The Venemous Mallice of my swelling heart.
2510   <S {Luc}.> Away Inhumaine Dogge, Vnhallowed Slaue,
2511   Sirs, helpe our Vnckle, to conuey him in,  <D {Flourish}.>
2512   The Trumpets shew the Emperour is at hand.
2513   <D {Sound Trumpets. Enter Emperour and Empresse, with}
2514   {#Tribunes and others}.>
2515   <S {Sat}.> What, hath the Firemament more Suns then one?
2516   <S {Luc}.> What bootes it thee to call thy selfe a Sunne?
2517  *<S {Mar}.> Romes Emperour & Nephewe breake the parle
2518   These quarrels must be quietly debated,
2519   The Feast is ready which the carefull {Titus},
      <P ee2>
2520   Hath ordained to an Honourable end,
2521   For Peace, for Loue, for League, and good to Rome:
2522   Please you therfore draw nie and take your places.
2523   <S {Satur}.> {Marcus} we will.  <D {Hoboyes}.>
2524   <D {A Table brought in}.
2525   {Enter Titus like a Cooke, placing the meat on}
2526   {the Table, and Lauinia with a vale ouer her face}.>
2527   <S {Titus}.> Welcome my gracious Lord,
2528   Welcome Dread Queene,
2529   Welcome ye Warlike Gothes, welcome {Lucius},
2530   And welcome all: although the cheere be poore,
2531   'Twill fill your stomacks, please you eat of it.
2532   <S {Sat}.> Why art thou thus attir'd {Andronicus}?
2533   <S {Tit}.> Because I would be sure to haue all well,
2534   To entertaine your Highnesse, and your Empresse.
2535   <S {Tam}.> We are beholding to you good {Andronicus}?
2536  *<S {Tit}.> #And if your Highnesse knew my heart, you were:
2537   My Lord the Emperour resolue me this,
2538   Was it well done of rash {Virginius},
2539   To slay his daughter with his owne right hand.
2540   Because she was enfor'st, stain'd, and deflowr'd?
2541   <S {Satur}.> It was {Andronicus}.
2542   <S {Tit}.> Your reason, Mighty Lord?
2543   <S {Sat}.> Because the Girle, should not suruiue her shame,
2544   And by her presence still renew his sorrowes.
2545   <S {Tit}.> A reason mighty, strong, and effectuall,
2546   A patterne, president, and liuely warrant,
2547   For me (most wretched) to performe the like:
2548   Die, die, {Lauinia}, and thy shame with thee,
2549   And with thy shame, thy Fathers sorrow die.
2550   <D {He kils her}.>
2551   <S {Sat}.> What #hast done, vnnaturall and vnkinde?
2552  *<S {Tit}.> Kil'd her for whom my teares haue made me blind.
2553   I am as wofull as {Virginius} was,
2554   And haue a thousand times more cause then he.
2555   <S {Sat}.> What was she rauisht? tell who did the deed,
2556   <S {Tit}.> #Wilt please you eat,
2557   #Wilt please your Highnesse feed?
2558   <S {Tam}.> Why hast thou slaine thine onely Daughter?
2559   <S {Titus}.> Not I, 'twas {Chiron} and {Demetrius},
2560   They rauisht her, and cut away her tongue,
2561   And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
2562   <S {Satu}.> Go fetch them hither to vs presently.
2563   <S {Tit}.> Why there they are both, baked in that Pie,
2564   Whereof their Mother daintily hath fed,
2565   Eating the flesh that she herselfe hath bred.
2566   'Tis true, 'tis true, witnesse my kniues sharpe point.
2567   <D {He stabs the Empresse}.>
2568   <S {Satu}.> Die franticke wretch, for this accursed deed.
2569   <S {Luc}.> Can the Sonnes eye, behold his Father bleed?
2570   There's meede for meede, death for a deadly deed.
2571  *<S {Mar}.> You sad fac'd men, people and Sonnes of Rome,
2572   By vprores seuer'd like a flight of Fowle,
2573   Scattred by windes and high tempestuous gusts:
2574   Oh let me teach you how, to knit againe
2575   This scattred Corne, into one mutuall sheafe,
2576   These broken limbs againe into one body.
2577   <S {Goth}.> Let Rome herselfe be bane vnto herselfe,
2578   And shee whom mightie kingdomes cursie #too,
2579   Like a forlorne and desperate castaway,
2580   Doe shamefull execution on her selfe.
2581   But if my frostie signes and chaps of age,
2582   Graue witnesses of true experience,
2583   Cannot induce you to attend my words,
2584   Speake Romes deere friend, as er'st our Auncestor,
2585   When with his solemne tongue he did discourse
2586   To loue- sicke {Didoes} sad attending eare,
2587   The story of that balefull burning night,
2588   When subtil Greekes surpriz'd King {Priams} Troy:
2589   Tell vs what {Sinon} hath bewicht our eares,
2590   Or who hath brought the fatall engine in,
2591   That giues our Troy, our Rome the ciuill wound.
2592   My heart is not compact of flint nor steele,
2593   Nor can I vtter all our bitter griefe,
2594   But floods of teares will drowne my Oratorie,
2595   And breake my very vttrance, euen in the time
2596   When it should moue you to attend me most,
2597   Lending your kind hand Commiseration.
2598   Heere is a Captaine, let him tell the tale,
2599   Your hearts will throb and weepe to heare him speake.
2600   <S {Luc}.> This Noble Auditory, be it knowne to you,
2601   That cursed {Chiron} and {Demetrius}
2602   Were they that murdred our Emperours Brother,
2603   And they it were that rauished our Sister,
2604   For their fell faults our Brothers were beheaded,
2605   Our Fathers teares despis'd, and basely cousen'd,
2606   Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrell out,
2607   And sent her enemies vnto the graue.
2608   Lastly, my selfe vnkindly banished,
2609   The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
2610   To beg reliefe among Romes Enemies,
2611   Who drown'd their enmity in my true teares,
2612   And op'd their armes to imbrace me as a Friend:
2613   And I am turned forth, be it knowne to you,
2614   That  haue preseru'd her welfare in my blood,
2615   And from her bosome tooke the Enemies point,
2616   Sheathing the steele in my aduentrous body.
2617   Alas you know, I am no Vaunter I,
2618   My scars can witnesse, dumbe although they are,
2619   That my report is iust and full of truth:
2620   But soft, me thinkes I do digresse too much,
2621   Cyting my worthlesse praise: Oh pardon me,
2622   For when no Friends are by, men praise themselues,
2623  *<S {Marc}.> Now is my turne to speake: Behold this Child,
2624   Of this was {Tamora} deliuered,
2625   The issue of an Irreligious {Moore},
2626   Chiefe Architect and plotter of these woes,
2627   The Villaine is aliue in {Titus} house,
2628   And as he is, to witnesse this is true.
2629   Now iudge what course had {Titus} to reuenge
2630   These wrongs, vnspeakeable past patience,
2631   Or more then any liuing man could beare.
2632  *Now you haue heard the truth, what say you Romaines?
2633   Haue we done ought amisse? shew vs wherein,
2634   And from the place where you behold vs now,
2635   The poore remainder of {Andronici},
2636   Will hand in hand all headlong cast vs downe,
2637   And on the ragged stones beat forth our braines,
2638   And make a mutuall closure of our house:
2639   Speake Romaines speake, and if you say we shall,
2640   Loe hand in hand, {Lucius} and I will fall.
2641   <S {Emilli}.> Come come, thou reuerent man of Rome,
2642   And bring our Emperour gently in thy hand,
2643   {#Lucius} our Emperour: for well I know,
2644   The common voyce do cry it shall be so.
2645   <S {Mar}.> {Lucius}, all haile Romes Royall Emperour,
2646   Goe, goe into old {Titus} sorrowfull house,
2647   And hither hale that misbelieuing {Moore},
2648   To be adiudg'd some direfull slaughtering death,
2649   As punishment for his most wicked life.
2650   {#Lucius} all haile to Romes gracious Gouernour.
      <P ee2v><C B>
2651   <S {Luc}.> Thankes gentle Romanes, may I gouerne so,
2652   To heale Romes harmes, and wipe away her woe.
2653   But gentle people, giue me ayme a- while,
2654   For Nature puts me to a heauy taske:
2655   Stand all aloofe, but Vnckle draw you neere,
2656   To shed obsequious teares vpon this Trunke:
2657   Oh take this warme kisse on thy pale cold lips,
2658   These sorrowfull drops vpon thy bloud- slaine face,
2659   The last true Duties of thy Noble Sonne.
2660   <S {Mar}.> Teare for teare, and louing kisse for kisse,
2661   Thy Brother {Marcus} tenders on thy Lips:
2662   O were the summe of these that I should pay
2663   Countlesse, and infinit, yet would I pay them.
2664   <S {Luc}.> Come hither Boy, come, come, and learne of vs
2665   To melt in showres: thy Grandsire lou'd thee well:
2666   Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee:
2667   Sung thee asleepe, his Louing Brest, thy Pillow:
2668   Many a matter hath he told to thee,
2669   Meete, and agreeing with thine Infancie:
2670   In that respect then, like a louing Childe,
2671   Shed yet some small drops from thy tender Spring,
2672   Because kinde Nature doth require it so:
2673   Friends, should associate Friends, in Greefe and Wo.
2674   Bid him farwell, commit him to the Graue,
2675   Do him that kindnesse, and take leaue of him.
2676  *<S {Boy}.> O Grandsire, Grandsire: euen with all my heart
2677   Would I were Dead, so you did Liue againe.
2678   O Lord, I cannot speake to him for weeping,
2679   My teares will choake me, if I ope my mouth.
2680   <S {Romans}.> You sad {Andronici}, haue done with woes,
2681   Giue sentence on this execrable Wretch,
2682   That hath beene breeder of these dire euents.
2683   <S {Luc}.> Set him brest deepe in earth, and famish him:
2684   There let him stand, and raue, and cry for foode:
2685   If any one releeues, or pitties him,
2686   For the offence, he dyes. This is our doome:
2687   Some stay, to see him fast'ned in the earth.
2688  *<S {Aron}.> O why should wrath be mute, & Fury dumbe?
2689   I am no Baby I, that with base Prayers
2690   I should repent the Euils I haue done.
2691   Ten thousand worse, then euer yet I did,
2692   Would I performe if I might haue my #will:
2693   If one good Deed in all my life I did,
2694   I do repent it from my very Soule.
2695  *<S {Lucius}.> Some louing Friends conuey the Emp[erour]. hence,
2696   And giue him buriall in his Fathers graue.
2697   My Father, and {Lauinia}, shall forthwith
2698   Be closed in our Housholds Monument:
2699   As for that heynous Tyger {Tamora},
2700   No Funerall Rite, nor man in mournfull Weeds:
2701   No mournfull Bell shall ring her Buriall:
2702   But throw her foorth to Beasts and Birds of prey:
2703   Her life was Beast- like, and deuoid of pitty,
2704   And being so, shall haue like want of pitty.
2705   See Iustice done on {Aaron} that damn'd Moore,
2706   From whom, our heauy happes had their beginning:
2707   Then afterwards, to Order well the State,
2708   That like Euents, may ne're it Ruinate.  <D {Exeunt omnes}.>
